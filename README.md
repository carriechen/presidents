# Presidential data

The scrapers are all located in `scraping/*.py` and rely on the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`, and `python-dateutil` libraries (among others). To install these libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

See [SOURCES](SOURCES.md) for documentation on where and how the data was collected.


# Presidential analysis

The substance of the analysis exists as IPython / Jupyter notebooks. See [`notebooks/`](notebooks/).
