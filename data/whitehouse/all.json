Ford, and as you can see, I’m wearing a jacket and a hat that they just gave me. Not really used to it, but it feels awfully good – I’m very proud of it actually.\nOur carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our totally unparalleled strength at sea.\nThis beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation, and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades and decades to come.\nA famous aviator once wrote that, to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a “desire for the vast and endless sea.” So true.\nIn the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country, and rebuild it we will.\nOn Tuesday, before a Joint Session [of] Congress, I laid out a vision – I hope you all watched – for how to accomplish that national rebuilding.\nMy vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts on our military.\nWe must give our sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen the tools, equipment, resources and training they need to get the job done, and get it done right - especially in these very dangerous times.\nThe active duty Army has been reduced by more than 85,000 men since 2009, and we have over 18,000 fewer active duty marines.\nThe Air Force, it’s the smallest it has been since 1947, and their planes are, on average, nearly thirty years old, if you can believe that.\nOur Navy's fleet is the smallest it has been since World War I, and that’s a long time ago.\nFrontline Navy and Marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky.\nWe cannot afford to continue down this path.  My budget will give America's armed forces the resources they need to achieve full and total military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges – and meet them, we will.\nInvesting in the military means investing in peace - because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it.\nMost importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform.  They are the best of us.  They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known - and we will support them every single step of the way.\nThese are truly exciting times.  Amazing opportunities are unfolding before us - to strengthen our military, to reboot our economy, and to bring back our jobs.  If we all work together, and put our country first, then anything is possible.  Let us seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal.\nMay God bless the men and women of our military, and may God bless the United States of America, the country we love.", "timestamp": "2017-03-03T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump’s Weekly Address"}

EST\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, first of all, I want to thank you very much.  Great job.  Really a fantastic job.  We just did a tour.  I was given a couple of beautiful cards by the students -- really well done.  And I appreciate it.\nAnd Bishop Noonan, thank you so much.  A very powerful man, and I -- the most powerful man, right?  (Laughter.)  And I appreciate it very much for your uplifting prayer.  I have to say that your support of schools like St. Andrews Catholic School has been incredible.  Everybody talks about it.  They talk about you.  You understand how much the students benefit from full education, one that enriches both the mind and the soul, a combination -- and that's a good combination.\nLatrina, I want to just thank you.  The job you've done is incredible.  Everyone -- we've been talking about you actually you have a big reputation in Florida.  You do know that, right?  (Laughter.)  For your talent and a lot of other things.  But I see it -- and for your love of what you do.  Because I could see as soon as I met you, the love that you have for what you do is really fantastic.  So I want to thank you very much.\nAnd Superintendent Fortier -- where is Superintendent?  Where is Superintendent?  You have been -- come here.  You have been fantastic.  And the job you're doing and willing to do is going to be -- I think with what's happening and with people like Marco and Rick Scott and the President and seeing this today -- I mean, it just -- it's going to get further and further because I know they're big fans.\nSo I'm grateful to have everybody here today.  I'm also very pleased and -- where is Rick Scott?  Right over here, Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio and, as you know, Secretary DeVos -- she was approved a couple of weeks ago.  And she's the one that we all report to when it comes to education.  And I know you're going to have a fantastic relationship with the Secretary, and that's going to be a lot of good things for your school and for the entire system.\nSt. Andrews Catholic School represents one of the many parochial schools dedicated to the education of some of our nation's most disadvantaged children.  But they're becoming just the opposite very rapidly through education and with the help of the school choice programs.  This month, we commemorate the thousands of peaceful activists for justice who joined Martin Luther King on the march from Selma to Montgomery.  And that day, Reverend King hoped that inferior education would become, as he said, \"a thing of the past.\"  And we're going to work very much for the future and what he predicted would be with the future.  As I've often said in my address to Congress and just about anyplace else I can speak, education is the civil rights issue of our time.  And it's why I've asked Congress to support a school-choice bill.  And we've come a long way.  I think we really -- we're right out there and we're ahead of -- we're ahead of schedule in so many ways when it comes to education.  And, again, Betsy is going to lead that -- you're going to lead that charge, right?\nSECRETARY DEVOS:  You bet.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You're going to do a fantastic job.  Denisha Merriweather is with us today and you were so wonderful the other night.\nMS. MERRIWEATHER:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That was quite a night.  I will say that, Denisha.  I was honored that Denisha joined Melania and myself as our guest to my address to Congress.  Denisha is the first in her family to graduate high school and college, and is about to complete her master's degree in social work, right?  (Applause.)  And Denisha, we want millions more to have the same chance to achieve the great success that you're achieving right now.  And you think that can be done, I'll bet, right?\nMS. MERRIWEATHER:  Of course.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look at that.  (Laughter.)  Her eyes light up.  And that's good news.  So I want to thank all of the parents and teachers and students at St. Andrews and all of the graduates that are with us today.  It's a special place.  It's also a special state.  Florida, to me, is a very, very special, special state.  I mean, I know those people back there -- they know why I like it so much.  We've had a lot of success in Florida and I love it.  It's my second home.  I'm here all the time.  We have the Southern White House in Florida.  (Laughter.)  And we get a lot of work done -- believe me, there's not rest at the Southern White House -- it's all work.  And we love this state.  And we love this state, the way it's managed between Marco and Rick and some of the others.  They're doing a great job and we appreciate it very much.  And thank you.  And thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nEND\n1:56 P.M.

CST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Wisconsin!\nAUDIENCE:  Hello!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much.  Thank you to my friend, Speaker Paul Ryan, for your wonderful introduction.  It is great to be in Janesville, the home of the Speaker of the House of the United States of America.  (Applause.)\nJanesville has almost taken on an epic category in America because what works in Janesville will work for the American people.  And I’m just delighted to be with all of you today.  And I’m deeply humbled by the esteem expressed by my friend and your neighbor, Paul Ryan.  And let me just assure you, people all across America are grateful to the people of Janesville for continuing to send Speaker Paul Ryan to Washington, D.C.  So thank you for that.  (Applause.)\nI also understand that your mom, Betty, is here.  Where is mom at?  Can mom take a bow?  Would you mind standing up?  Paul Ryan’s mom, everybody.  This is a big deal.  Turn around and wave at the media.  (Applause.)  Wonderful to see you and thank you for being with us today.\nThe President and I are grateful for your son’s principled leadership in the House of Representatives.  It seems like just yesterday, 16 years ago, when I arrived in Washington, D.C. -- just a couple of years after Paul arrived there.  We were both young and dashing congressmen.  (Laughter.)  And one of us changed -- (laughter) -- and one of us looks exactly like he did the day you sent him.\nBut I’m deeply humbled to call your congressmen and our Speaker my friend.  And I know for a fact that, Paul, your partnership with this administration is going to benefit the American people for generations to come, and we’re grateful.  (Applause.)  Would you mind just giving him one of those standing ovations that you gave out to a few of us?  He sure does deserve it.  (Applause.)\nAlso, it’s really great to be back in Wisconsin.  Thanks to all of you, your hard work, your support and your prayers, Wisconsin voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America, and he and I couldn’t be more grateful.  (Applause.)\nIt was quite a campaign.  And it’s already been quite an administration too, hasn’t it?  (Laughter.)  How many of you watched the President’s address to the Congress on Tuesday night, show of hands.  How about that?  What you saw three nights ago is literally what I see every day -- the boundless optimism, the energy and unshakeable faith in the American people and the ability of the American people to make America great again.  That’s what you saw, and that’s what inspired the nation.  (Applause.)\nIt’s deeply humbling for me to serve as Vice President of the United States.  I’m just a small-town guy from southern Indiana.  My grandfather actually immigrated to this country, came over on a boat from Ireland, went through Ellis Island and drove a bus in Chicago for 40 years.  I was actually named after my grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley.  That’s who Michael Richard Pence got his name from.\nI mean, I can’t imagine what my grandfather is thinking about looking down from glory, except that he’s very surprised about his grandson.  (Laughter.)  But also that he was right.  He was right about America.  Because anybody can be anybody in “the land of the free and the home of the brave.”  And it’s a joy to be with you today.\nAnd it’s a joy for me to serve as Vice President in this country because America has a President with broad shoulders and a big heart.  And speaking of which, on behalf of the President of the United States, let me say thank you, Wisconsin, for your support for our new Commander-in-Chief and our new President, Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nIt was hardworking Americans like all of you who were some of our biggest supporters.  Communities just like Janesville were really the wellspring of support for President Donald Trump in this campaign.  And on his behalf, I want to thank you for that support, and thank you for being here today.  It’s a privilege to be joined by a couple other people I want to mention before I get to the body of my remarks.\nI hope you can sense the caliber, the character, the experience, and the extraordinary confidence that our new secretary of Health and Human Services brings to this task.  Dr. Tom Price, President Trump and I and people across this country are grateful that you have stood up to fill this important role in the life of our nation at such a time as this.  Would you thank him again?  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m also honored to be joined today by another great, dedicated public servant.  Senator Ron Johnson, thank you for being here, thank you for your great leadership, and congratulations.  (Applause.)  Congratulations on the renewal of your six-year contract here in Wisconsin.  We couldn’t be more pleased.\nBut I also want to thank all the business leaders who are with us today, including and maybe most especially, our host, Jane Blain Gilbertson, and the Blain’s Farm and Fleet team.  What an awesome company.  What an awesome leader.  What a great American success story.  (Applause.)\nJane got together all these great people from here in Janesville, and we did some listening today, didn’t we?  As Paul said, we listened to the local farmers, and builders, and job creators.  I really enjoyed our discussion, and I appreciate the candid feedback that you shared with us that we’ll carry back to Washington, D.C.\nBut last but not least, let me just say thanks -- thanks to all of you here who are part of this incredible Farm and Fleet team.  The employees and the families that came out today -- you are the backbone of our economy, of our country, of Janesville, and the President, the Speaker, and all of us are grateful for your character, your work ethic, and all you do to make this a great place to live, and to work, and to raise a family.  Give yourselves a round of applause, folks.  (Applause.)\nBut I’m grateful to be here to talk about family business.  The President and I are going to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of small businesses across this country because I grew up in a small-business family, in a small-business town.  My dad was in the gas station business.  I worked at a gas station as a gas station attendant -- had my name on my shirt, right.  Little blue short-sleeve shirt, when I was only fourteen years of age, and used to -- for those of you that are a little bit younger, a gas station attendant -- (laughter) -- if you could imagine, if you pulled into a gas station and someone came running toward your car, and filled it up, and washed the windshield, and checked the tires, and didn’t charge you any more money for it.  That was where I grew up in a small business.\nAnd as the world knows, the President grew up in a family business too.  I mean, he and I both know the sacrifices that are required for a small family business in communities like where I grew up, Queens where he grew up and in -- and right here in Janesville -- long hours, hard work.  And we both know the fundamental truth of our economy:  When small business is strong, America is strong, and we’re going fight every day for small business America.  (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I want you to become stronger than ever, and I’ll tell you what right now.  President Donald Trump is the best friend Wisconsin businesses will ever have.  (Applause.)  You might have gotten that impression Tuesday night, just a couple days ago.  He actually talked about an employer up here.  I don’t know if you heard about Harley-Davidson -- (laughter) -- here in Wisconsin.  The President actually hosted Harley-Davidson at the White House.  It was an honor for me to join him.  And you saw him talk about that in his speech to the Congress.  And companies like Blain's Farm and Fleet are the engines of the economy, Harley-Davidson, and as President Trump said, whether it's going to be to kick start that engine or turn the key of that engine, we're going to restart the engine of the American economy and create jobs and prosperity and growth like never before.  I promise you that.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, exactly what he's doing -- it's, in fact, already happening.  On day one, he went right to work on doing job-destroying policies and executive orders of the -- eight years.  After years of delays, for instance, President Trump authorized the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, creating thousands of American jobs and strengthening our energy infrastructure.  (Applause.)  He signed legislation, thanks to the Congress and Speaker Ryan and Senator Johnson, he signed legislation already to roll back reams of red tape and he's instructed every agency in Washington, D.C., to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on businesses and entrepreneurs in America.  (Applause.)\nHe's taken decisive action to end illegal immigration once and for all to strengthen our borders and uphold the laws of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  And businesses around America are already reacting and responding to President Trump's call to buy American and hire American, and they're doing that with optimism and investment all across the country.  Literally from coast to coast, and especially here in the Midwest, companies are announcing they're keeping jobs and creating new ones -- tens of thousands of jobs literally since Election Day.  It's not just the stock market that's taken a positive leap forward, but companies like Ford Motor Company, just next door in Michigan, recently announced that they were not going to do a plant in Mexico and, instead, they were going to expand a plant in Michigan.  And they called it a \"vote of confidence\" in President Donald Trump and his vision for America.  And other businesses are joining them.  (Applause.)\nI've got to tell you, this administration has the biggest, boldest and best agenda this country has ever seen, and we're going to pass it with the support of Speaker Ryan and our great leadership in the House and in the Senate, from top to bottom.  And let me make you a promise:  The Obamacare nightmare is about to end.  (Applause.)  Despite the best efforts of some activists and town hall meetings around the country, the truth of the matter is the American people know -- Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go.  (Applause.)\nI heard it today.  (Applause.)  I heard it today.  I don't know if we're going to stop by Italian House later -- (laughter) -- but I'm hungry.  (Laughter.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Now we're not.  (Laughter.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Paul said, \"Now we're not.\"  (Laughter.)  Can't announce that stuff in advance.  (Laughter.)  But come on, Edmund, do you got, like, a to-go thing or something there?  (Laughter.)  Would that be all right?  Can I get Italian House to go?  Would that be all right with everybody, man?  (Applause.)\nWe were just hearing from Edmund a minute ago -- he's a great employer, a great American success story here in Janesville, but he talked about the weight that Obamacare has placed on his great family-owned business.  And it's a weight that's been placed on businesses and employers all across this country, let alone the weight it's placed on American families.\nI mean, literally, it literally is just a long list of broken promises, isn't it?  I mean, remember all the promises about Obamacare?  They told you the cost of health insurance would go down, right?  Not true.  They told us if you like your doctor, you could keep him.  Not true.  They told us if you like your health insurance plan, you could keep it.  Not true.  I mean, talk about your fake news.  I mean, the truth is -- the truth is just virtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken.\nToday, Americans are paying $3,000 a year more on average for their health insurance than when Obamacare was passed into law.  And premiums are skyrocketing -- last year by more than 25 percent on average around the country, millions have lost their plans and lost their doctors.  And not only that, Obamacare, as Edmund was describing, is a job-killer, and everybody knows it.\nThe last few years, it's been hard enough to get ahead and Obamacare has only made it much harder and, in many ways, if not impossible for many small businesses.  The endless premium hikes, the reams of red tape eat up time and money that would be better spent growing your business and benefitting your workers.  And every year the burden grows, so do the hard choices that you have to make.\nBut not for long.  I'm going to make you a promise -- you heard the President say it -- and give direction to the Congress.  And it's just going to start happening in just a few days.  We're going to repeal Obamacare once and for all, and eliminate all its mandates and taxes and intrusion into your personal lives and into the lives of your business.  (Applause.)\nAnd best of all -- best of all, the President directed the Congress right after that election today to -- at the same time that we repeal Obamacare, we're going to replace it with something that actually works and lowers the cost of health insurance for every American.  (Applause.)  The President and I want every American to have access to quality, affordable health insurance.  That's why we're going to pass a better law that lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.  And we've got an incredible team working literally every single day around the clock to get that done.  In Secretary Price, America has one of the leading experts on healthcare in the country -- I hope you picked up he's a medical doctor.  (Laughter.)  All right?  I mean, how many times in Washington -- this is only the third time in the history of the Department of Health and Human Services that a physician has led that Department.\nThe President and I are working with him, with Speaker Ryan and his outstanding team in the House of Representatives with Leader McConnell, Senator Johnson, with all of our leaders in Congress, and we're putting the finishing touches on our plan, even as this weekend rolls out.  A better plan for a brighter future that's built on a foundation of individual freedom and personal responsibility will replace Obamacare.  (Applause.)\nThe President talked about it the other night, but you know the outlines -- we're going to give Americans the freedom to buy health insurance that's best for you and end the era of government-mandated health insurance in this country.  We're going to let you buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance.  That's how you bring down the cost of health insurance -- you create a national marketplace and then you get that little lizard and you get Flo on television -- (laughter) -- and let them start selling cheaper health insurance to every American.  That's the American way.  (Applause.)\nWe'll make also -- make sure, I promise you, that Americans struggling with preexisting conditions have access to the coverage and the care that they need.  And we'll give states the flexibility and the freedom and the resources they need to take care of our most vulnerable.  You know, just the other day, I was talking to one of my favorite elected officials in America, Governor Scott Walker.  (Applause.)  I mean, what is in the water here in Wisconsin?  Governor Scott Walker is not only leading the association of fellow governors of his party across the country, but he's a recognized national leader and I'm honored to call him a friend.\nAs a former governor myself, he and I both know that every state is unique.  The challenges here in Wisconsin are different than they are down in Illinois, different than they are in the state of Indiana, Minnesota.  And what Scott Walker is doing is he's pulled together governors from around the country, we met last weekend in Washington, D.C.  And we're working on ensuring that when we repeal and replace Obamacare, that we're going to allow states to have the flexibility to craft state-based solutions that will work for the people of their individual states.  What will work in Wisconsin is better designed by the people of Wisconsin for the needs of the most vulnerable in this state.  And I’m grateful for his leadership.  (Applause.)\nAnd despite what the other side is saying, all the -- creating anxiety for Americans, the President said it last fall in Philadelphia, he said it again this week:  We’re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system that finally puts the American people first.\nSo it’s about healthcare right out of the gate.  And our 45th President has said that’s the number-one priority, and we’re going right to work on it in just a matter of days.  But President Trump’s agenda doesn’t stop there.  I could keep you here the rest of the afternoon to tell you about all the things the President planned, but let me touch on a few.\nI loved it when he was out campaigning in Wisconsin and I was a little bit myself.  President Trump, you see, had a three-part agenda:  Jobs, jobs and jobs.  And this President is going to get this economy moving again by passing the biggest package of tax relief since the days of Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.)\nWith the strong support of Speaker Ryan and Senator Ron Johnson, we’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms.  We’re also going to keep rolling back job-killing regulations, rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can’t cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C.\nWe’re going to end wasteful government spending and restore fiscal responsibility to our nation’s capital.  We’re going to pass an infrastructure package so that America, once again, has the best roads, bridges, highways, airports that we’ve ever had in the history of this nation.  (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I believe that roads mean jobs.  And not just road jobs; when you have the right infrastructure, this builder who’s become President knows the right investments and the right infrastructure is going to make for a more prosperous Wisconsin and a more prosperous America.\nAnd, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it:  Thanks to President Trump, this economy is going to grow faster than ever before.  But making America great again also means restoring safety to our streets, keeping our country secure, and President Trump hasn’t wasted any time on that either.\nI’ll tell you what, in my lifetime, I couldn’t be more proud, because I’ve never seen at this level -- and they know it -- President Trump stands with the men and women who serve in law enforcement all across this country like no one I’ve ever met.  (Applause.)  We’re going to stand with those men and women who keep our communities safe every single day.  And we’re going to continue to take steps to make sure that people that are coming into this country don’t represent a threat to our families or to our way of life.\nPresident Trump is standing tall with our allies, standing up to our enemies.  He’s also working to rebuild our military.  I’m the proud father of a United States Marine.  (Applause.)  And truth of the matter, in recent years, we’ve seen budget cuts that have failed to provide our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines with the resources that they need to do their jobs.  That’s all about to change.\nUnder President Donald Trump, with the leadership of this Congress, we’re going to rebuild our military.  We’re going to restore the arsenal of democracy.  We’re going to make sure our armed forces have the resources and training they need to protect our nation starting right now.  (Applause.)\nMy friends, President Trump is keeping his promises, promises he made to the people of Wisconsin and promises he made to the American people.  And that includes one of his most consequential promises.  Out on the campaign trail, there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States.  The President said that he would promise to name someone to the Supreme Court in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.  And I promise you, in Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump has kept his word to nominate a jurist who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States of America.  And we look forward to him being confirmed by the United States Senate.  (Applause.)\nHealthcare reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, taking steps to make America secure, ensuring that the highest court in the land upholds our highest ideals.  That’s what it looks like to make America great again.  And President Trump is fighting to make that happen every single day, every single moment.  And we’re going to continue fighting.\nNow, we’re hearing from plenty who want to stick with the status quo, whether it be on healthcare or other issues -- whether it’s the media, the establishment, insiders and the rest, they have no problem standing in the way of change.  But trust me, whatever challenges face us today, we’re going stay in the promise-keeping business.  And President Trump is going to deliver on this moment for the people of the United States of America.\nAnd we’re going to make America more prosperous again.  We’re going to have a better healthcare system that respects the doctor-patient relationship and harnesses the power of the private marketplace.  We’re going to make America safe again.  And with your help and with God’s help, I promise you, Wisconsin, I promise you, Janesville, we’re going to make America great again.\nThank you very much.  Thank you for coming out today.  And just God bless you.  God bless America.  (Applause.)\nEND\n12:58 P.M.

Ford USS -- what a place.  It really feels like a place.  You stand on that deck, and you feel like you're standing on a very big piece of land.  But this is better than land.  It will not only be a great symbol of American strength, but a great legacy for your father, and our former President, Gerald Ford.\nPresident Ford was a Navy man.  By the way, he was also a great athlete, for those of you that didn’t know.  He saw action in the South Pacific during World War II.  He served this country with honor -- in the military, in Congress, and in the White House.  The proud dignity of this ship is a fitting tribute to Gerald Ford, the man and the President.\nCongratulations to all of the men and women who helped build it.  This is American craftsmanship at its biggest, at its best, at its finest.  American workers are the greatest anywhere in the world.  This warship, and all who serve on it, should be a source of shared pride for our nation.  We are joined today -- (applause) -- better believe it, right?  Better believe it.  (Applause.)  Better believe it.  And, by the way, we're going to soon have more coming.  We'll have more coming.  (Applause.)\nWe are joined today by General Mattis, now Secretary Mattis -- (applause) -- where is he? -- who will be charged with overseeing this great rebuilding of our military might.  We will give the men and women of America’s armed services the resources you need to keep us safe.  We will have the finest equipment in the world -- planes, ships and everything else.  We are going to have, very soon, the finest equipment in the world.  (Applause.)\nWe will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war and only do one thing -- you know what that is?  Win!  Win!  (Applause.)  We're going to start winning again.\nAdmiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, is with us today as well -- great gentleman.  Admiral, we're going to ensure our Navy has the resources, personnel training and equipment -- the kind of equipment that you need.  So, congratulations, Admiral.  And a lot more is coming.  (Applause.)\nLet me congratulate Captain Richard McCormack, Commanding Officer of the Gerald R. Ford.  This ship will make an extraordinary addition to the fleet like no other -- like no other.  Anywhere in the world there's nothing like this.  It represents the future of naval aviation.  I have no greater privilege than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief and the Commander-in-Chief of the men and women of the United States military.  Great people.  (Applause.)  Great, great people.\nI salute you, and I salute our sailors.  I will always support you and your mission.  I will never, ever let you down.  And I also have to recognize Mike Petters, President and CEO of Huntington Ingalls Industries along with Matt Mulherin, President of Newport News Shipbuilding.  (Applause.)  They won't let you down either.  (Applause.)  They're not going to let you down either.  (Applause.)\nTo those who serve our nation in uniform and to those who build the instruments of our defense, I thank you on behalf of our nation.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  U-S-A!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughter.)  I agree, I agree.  (Laughter.)\nOur carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas.  We are standing today on 4.5 acres of combat power and sovereign U.S. territory, the likes of which there is nothing to compete.  There is no competition to this ship.  It is a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace.  This ship will carry 4,500 personnel and 70 aircraft, and will be a vital component of our defense.  This carrier and the new ships in the Ford class will expand the ability of our nation to carry out vital missions on the oceans to project American power in distant lands.  Hopefully, it's power we don’t have to use, but if we do, they're in big, big trouble.  (Applause.)\nThis great aircraft carrier provides essential capabilities to keep us safe from terrorism and take the fight to the enemy for many years in the future.  The great Admiral Nimitz, who commanded the U.S. Pacific fleet through the Second World War, once said, \"It is the function of the Navy to carry the war to the enemy so that we'll not be fought on U.S. soil.\"  True.  (Applause.)  And it was under Admiral Nimitz's command 75 years ago this June that the Navy did just that at the Battle of Midway.  You've all known about the Battle of Midway, where the sailors of the U.S. Navy fought with the bravery that will be remembered throughout the ages.  Storied bravery throughout the ages.\nThe backbone of the American fleet at Midway was three beautiful aircraft carriers:  the Yorktown, the Enterprise and the Hornet.  All three were built with American hands right here at the Newport News Shipyard.  (Applause.)  At Midway, America was greatly outnumbered by, I mean, a lot -- (laughter) -- and its fleet badly damaged.  But the heroic deeds changed the course of history.  Many brave Americans died that day, and, through their sacrifice, they turned the tide of the Pacific War.  It was a tough tide, it was a big tide, it was a vicious tide, and they turned it.\nCountless other Americans in that war, some of them parents and grandparents to people in this room today, came home thanks to their very heroic deeds.  The sailors at Midway are part of a long line of American heroes, an unbroken chain of patriots from each generation to the next, who rose to defend our flag and our freedom.\nThat legacy continues today as American warriors protect our people from the threat of terrorism.  On Tuesday, in my address to a joint session of Congress, I asked Congress to eliminate the defense sequester and to support my request for a great rebuilding of the United States military and the United States Navy.  (Applause.)\nAfter years of endless budget cuts that have impaired our defenses, I am calling for one of the largest defense-spending increases in history.  And by eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which, of course, is very important, right?  Got to get a good deal.  If we don’t make a good deal, we’re not doing our job.\nThe same boat for less money.  The same ship for less money.  The same airplanes for less money.  That’s what we’re doing.  That’s what we’re doing.  Means we’re going to get more of them, and we can use them.\nOur military requires sustained, stable funding to meet the growing needs placed on our defense.  Right now, our aging frontline strike and strike-fighters -- the whole aircraft; many, many aircraft -- are often more likely to be downed for maintenance than they are to be up in the sky.  Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe it or not, World War I.  Don’t worry, it's going to soon be the largest it’s been.  Don’t worry.  (Applause.)  Think of that.  Think of that.\nIn these troubled times, our Navy is the smallest it’s been since World War I.  That’s a long time ago.  In fact, I just spoke with Navy and industry leaders and have discussed my plans to undertake a major expansion of our entire Navy fleet, including having the 12-carrier Navy we need.  (Applause.)\nWe also need more aircraft, modernized capabilities, and greater force levels.  Additionally, we must vastly improve our cyber capabilities.  This great rebuilding effort will create many jobs in Virginia, and all across America, and it will also spur new technology and new innovation.\nAmerica has always been the country that boldly leads the world into the future, and my budget will ensure we do so and continue to do exactly that.  American ships will sail the seas.  American planes will soar the skies.  American workers will build our fleets.  (Applause.)  And America’s military will ensure that even though the darkest nights and throughout, a bright and glowing sun will always shine on our nation and on our people. Our Navy is great.  Our Navy is great.  Our people are great.  Great.  (Applause.)\nOur Republic will meet any challenge, defeat any danger, face any threat, and always seek true and lasting peace.\nMay God bless our military.  May God bless our Navy.  May God bless the wonderful Gerald Ford family.  And may God continue to bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nEND\n2:42 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States -- (applause) -- and citizens of America:\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.  (Applause.)  Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.  (Applause.)\nEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.  That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world.  I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.  A new chapter -- (applause) -- of American Greatness is now beginning.  A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.  And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\nWhat we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.  Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.  (Applause.)  All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\nIn nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our independence.  It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.  But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?  What kind of country will we leave for our children?\nI will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.  For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.  We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.\nWe've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.  And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\nThen, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet.  The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -- families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.  Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.  Because only then can we truly make America great again.  (Applause.)\nDying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.  Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.  Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.  Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop.  And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.  Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.  (Applause.)\nIt's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.\nSince my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.  (Applause.)\nThe stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.\nWe have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban -- (applause) -- thank you -- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\nWe have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency.  (Applause.)  And we’re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  (Applause.)  We’re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.  (Applause.)\nWe have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- (applause) -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.  And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.  (Applause.)\nWe have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  (Applause.)  And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.  (Applause.)\nTo protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.  I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.  (Applause.)  We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.  (Applause.)\nAt the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.  (Applause.)  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.  (Applause.)  We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.  (Applause.)\nFor that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.  (Applause.)  As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.\nTo any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question:  What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?  (Applause.)\nOur obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)  According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.\nWe have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world.  It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  (Applause.)  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.  We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.  We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.  (Applause.)\nThat is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm.  (Applause.)\nAs promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.  (Applause.)\nI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.  (Applause.)\nFinally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.  (Applause.)\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Maureen.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.  He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.  (Applause.)\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.  Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.  Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.  More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working.  We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.  In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.\nWe've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.  Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.  And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\nSolving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.  It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.  But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.  (Applause.)\nRight now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.  My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.  (Applause.)  It will be a big, big cut.\nAt the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.  We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.  We have to do it.  (Applause.)  Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes.  But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.  In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.  ((Laughter and applause.)  And they wanted me to ride one and I said, \"No, thank you.\"  (Laughter.)\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it's good.  I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?  They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it -- that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.  They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.  They weren't even asking for a change.  But I am.  (Applause.)\nI believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.  It's been a long time since we had fair trade.  The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people.\"  Lincoln was right -- and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.  (Applause.)  I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.  They have taken advantage of our country.  No longer.  (Applause.)\nI am going to bring back millions of jobs.  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.  (Applause.)  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.  Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.  (Applause.)  It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\nSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.  It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class.  And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.  (Applause.)\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation's security; and to restore respect for our laws.  If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.  (Applause.)\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the Interstate Highway System.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.  (Applause.)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East -- all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.  (Applause.)\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs.  (Applause.)  This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.  (Applause.)\nTonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare -- (applause) -- with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.  (Applause.)\nMandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.  (Applause.)  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.  (Applause.)\nObamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state -- the state of Kentucky -- and it's unsustainable and collapsing.\nOne-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.  They are losing them so fast.  They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all.  There’s no choice left.  Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?  We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.   Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  (Applause.)\nAction is not a choice, it is a necessity.  So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.  (Applause.)\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.  (Applause.)\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts -- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.  (Applause.)\nThirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.  (Applause.)\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.  (Applause.)\nAnd finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines -- (applause) -- which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.  So important.\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed.  Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\nOur citizens deserve this, and so much more -- so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?  (Applause.)  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.  (Applause.)\nMy administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave -- (applause) -- to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.  (Applause.)\nTrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all.  Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.  (Applause.)\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past five.  On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.  He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.  Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.  (Applause.)\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.  But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.  If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.  (Applause.)  In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child.  Education is the civil rights issue of our time.  (Applause.)  I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children.  (Applause.)  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.  (Applause.)\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.  But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning -- a great learning center -- with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.\nToday, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her master’s degree in social work.  We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.  (Applause.)\nBut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.  The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.  In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.  This is not acceptable in our society.  (Applause.)\nEvery American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.  (Applause.)  But to create this future, we must work with, not against -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  We must build bridges of cooperation and trust -- not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it's what it is, division.  It's pure, unadulterated division.  We have to unify.\nPolice and sheriffs are members of our community.  They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.  We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)\nAnd we must support the victims of crime.  I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.  The office is called VOICE -- Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.  (Applause.)  Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.  Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\nJamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.  Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.  But he never got the chance.  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.  Jamiel, thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.  Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California.  They were pillars of their community.  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.  Should have never been in our country.\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.  Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.  (Applause.)\nTo Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.  We will always honor their memory.  (Applause.)\nFinally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win.  (Applause.)\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester -- (applause) -- and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.  My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.  Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.  (Applause.)\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater.  And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.  (Applause.)\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.  (Applause.)  I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that -- and I quote -- \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\"  Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And Ryan is looking down, right now -- you know that -- and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.  (Laughter and applause.)\nFor as the Bible teaches us, \"There is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.\"  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.  And we will never forget Ryan.  (Applause.)\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.  Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.  (Applause.)\nBut our partners must meet their financial obligations.  And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.  In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in.  Very nice.  (Applause.)  We expect our partners -- whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific -- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.  Have to do that.\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.  (Applause.)  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.  My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. (Applause.)\nBut we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past.  We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world -- all across the world.  The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.  (Applause.)\nAmerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.  We want peace, wherever peace can be found.\nAmerica is friends today with former enemies.  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.  Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.  At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.  Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.  Remington unveiled the first typewriter.  An early attempt was made at electric light.  Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.  Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.  (Applause.)\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.  Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.  American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.  Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.  And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.  (Applause.)\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before -- for all Americans.  This is our vision.  This is our mission.  But we can only get there together.  We are one people, with one destiny.  We all bleed the same blood.  We all salute the same great American flag.  And we all are made by the same God.  (Applause.)\nWhen we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.  The time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us.  We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\nI am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country.  I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.  Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.  (Applause.)\nEND\n10:09 P.M.

This group has been fantastic, and many of which we were with yesterday and really developed something very special. So thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, also -- Mike, for being here.\nThis is a very important moment, and a moment that means a great deal to me. This month has been a wonderful opportunity to celebrate African-American history, and to begin working together to create a better future for African-Americans and universities and colleges, and everything that is African-American. Today, we're taking action to help make that future happen and that future better.\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities are incredibly important institutions, woven into the fabric of our history just about like no other. Church is very important, right? Colleges and universities. Mike is my defender. (Laughter.) Education has the power to uplift. It has the power to transform. And, perhaps most important, education has the power to create greater equality and justice in our lives.\nThat’s why today I'm thrilled to be signing an executive order to recognize the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Very important. They have played such an important role in achieving progress for African-Americans and in our nation’s march for justice. HBCUs have been really pillars of the African-American community for more than 150 years -- amazing job -- and a grand and enduring symbol of America at its absolute best. And I congratulate you all.\nWith this executive order, we will make HBCUs a priority in the White House -- an absolute priority. (Applause.) A lot of people are going to be angry that they're not a priority, but that's okay. (Laughter.) And we will pledge our support to you, your mission, and to our shared mission of bringing education and opportunity to all of our people.\nAnd so I just want to congratulate -- these are very, very special people surrounding me. You've done an amazing job. It's not easy. Nothing is easy. But you've done an amazing job. And I just want to congratulate you all, and I want to thank you on behalf of our country.\nAnd so I'm going to sign this. This is really fantastic. (Applause.)\nEND\n2:41 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, everybody. We appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to congratulate Scott Pruitt, who's here someplace. Where's Scott? (Applause.) So important. We're going to free up our country, and it's going be done in a very environmental and positive environmental way, I will tell you that, but create millions of jobs. So many jobs are delayed for so many years, and it's unfair to everybody. So I want congratulate Scott.\nI want to thank everyone for being here today. We have a great group of farmers, homebuilders, and county commissioners. They're all represented. They're standing alongside of me. I’d also like to thank Jim Inhofe, who's been so terrific in so many different ways, beyond even this. So I want thank Jim and also the leadership in the Senate on the issue, a friend of mine -- a great friend of mine -- John Barrasso.\nThe EPA’s so-called “Waters of the United States” rule is one of the worst examples of federal regulation, and it has truly run amok, and is one of the rules most strongly opposed by farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers all across our land. It's prohibiting them from being allowed to do what they're supposed to be doing. It's been a disaster.\nThe Clean Water Act says that the EPA can regulate “navigable waters” -- meaning waters that truly affect interstate commerce. But a few years ago, the EPA decided that “navigable waters” can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer's land, or anyplace else that they decide -- right? It was a massive power grab. The EPA’s regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands, and regulations and permits started treating our wonderful small farmers and small businesses as if they were a major industrial polluter. They treated them horribly. Horribly.\nIf you want to build a new home, for example, you have to worry about getting hit with a huge fine if you fill in as much as a puddle -- just a puddle -- on your lot. I've seen it. In fact, when it was first shown to me, I said, no, you're kidding aren’t you? But they weren’t kidding.\nIn one case in a Wyoming, a rancher was fined $37,000 a day by the EPA for digging a small watering hole for his cattle. His land. These abuses were, and are, why such incredible opposition to this rule from the hundreds of organizations took place in all 50 states. It's a horrible, horrible rule. Has sort of a nice name, but everything else is bad. (Laughter.) I've been hearing about it for years and years. I didn’t know I'd necessarily be in this position to do something about it, but we've been hearing about it for years.\nWith today’s executive order, I’m directing the EPA to take action, paving the way for the elimination of this very destructive and horrible rule.\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. And I will sign wherever I'm supposed to sign. There we are. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\nEND\n2:27 P.M.

give her another round of applause.  She’s going to be working closely with all of you.\nTo the presidents of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, representatives of the United Negro College Fund, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, distinguished guests, welcome to the White House.\nIt is my great privilege to serve as Vice President of the United States with the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.  And I know -- I know that you all just came from a brief meeting in the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  So I know you've already experienced the President’s warm hospitality and heard his expressions of appreciation for your leadership and for your willingness to come together to discuss the important work that each of you, and the desire of this administration to continue to partner -- partner with you on behalf of education all across this country.\nMy note said that the President wanted me to send greetings to you, but he already did.  (Laughter.)  Which happens to me a lot.  The President is a very hospitable person.  And when he hears that there are wonderful people like yourselves in the White House, you see what happens.  And I’m so pleased that you had a chance to share a few minutes with him today.\nEarlier this month, President Trump signed a proclamation marking Black History Month.  In that proclamation, it read that, “the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and the spirit that continue to make our Nation great.”\nAnd those words are true and we celebrate them with you today.\nOver the past month he visited the African American History Museum, and just last week he dedicated his weekly radio address to Black History Month.  The President understands, as you saw firsthand today, the importance of recognizing the African American community’s amazing contributions to the life of this nation.\nAnd that's why I wanted to come over here today on the President’s behalf.  And the schools represented here really have made an indelible mark for generations on the life of this nation.\nIt’s amazing to think about it, for more than 150 years, historically black colleges and universities have educated African American leaders, often when no other opportunity was available to them.\nThe first school -- Cheyney University, in Pennsylvania, founded in 1837, more than 20 years before the Civil War.  It and the schools that followed have furnished the type of learning that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., would describe over a century later as “Intelligence plus character -- the goal of true education.”\nThe path has not been an easy one throughout the long 150-year history for your institutions.  And your students, your faculty, your professors have stood firm through a transformational time in the life of the nation and been a part of that transformation in countless ways.\nYou've transformed lives through education.  You've helped lead our country toward a more perfect union.  And just know the President and I and all the members of our administration appreciate and admire the contribution of our historically black colleges and universities.  Would you just give yourselves a round of applause?  It is a history to be proud of.  (Applause.)\nToday, with over 100 historically black colleges and universities in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, hundreds of thousands of African American students have turned to you for quality education, including, I’m told, more than 300,000 students as we speak today.  (Applause.)\nEven more inspiring than that, I am told that many of those students were the first in their family to go to college.  My dad was in that category and went off to college and raised each one of us kids with that finger pointed in the middle of our chest.  (Laughter.)  You know what I’m talking about?  I just don't ever remember a day that Dad didn't look at me and say, I don't care what you else you do with your life, but you're going to college.  (Laughter.)\nAnd those first generation college students transform families and they transform a nation.  And we celebrate them and their role on your campuses even through this day.  And throughout the history of your institutions when those first-time students graduated, they departed, degree in hand, prepared and determined to add their own unique brush stroke to the beautiful American tapestry and the legacy of African Americans.\nAnd so many have in some many countless ways.  They've done just that.  If you think about it, nearly one in four African Americans with a bachelor’s degree graduated from your schools.  (Applause.)  This includes leaders in every industry in this country and in every walk of life.  Forty percent of African American members of Congress -- as a former member of Congress, I’m happy to report 40 percent of African American members of Congress graduated from a historically black college and university.  (Applause.)\nThe indisputable conclusion is that your schools have played a major role, not only in the African American community, but in the life of nation, and the life of the nation’s economy.  And we really gather today to reflect on that and to celebrate that.  And those gathered here from across our administration look forward to a dialogue with each one of you about how we can continue to strengthen the role that historically black colleges and universities play in the lives of families across this country and in the life of this nation.\nAmerica is unquestionably stronger because of the institutions that are represented here.  And this evening, President Trump and I just wanted to express our thanks.  As the President said in his recent radio address, your schools “do a fantastic job.”   His words.  (Laughter.)  And you deserve far more credit than you get, and know that beginning today, this administration is committed to making sure that our historically black colleges and universities get the credit and the attention they deserve.  (Applause.)\nOur administration at the President’s direction is working to find new ways to expand your impact so that more students, especially in the underserved communities in this country, have the chance at a quality education.  We want to partner with you.  We want to partner with you to help train the students of today to face the challenges and to lead in America tomorrow.\nThis also requires us to help students at an even earlier age -- make no mistake about it.  Secretary DeVos is dedicated to expanding opportunities through educational choice all across this country, ensuring that whether it’s a public school, a public charter school, or even a private school -- that parents on an increasing basis will have the ability to choose where their young children go to school regardless of their income and area code.  And we're going to work with each one of you to make that a reality.\nWe're also going to be working on economic development, not only increasing educational opportunities but doing all we can to revitalize communities across this country -- large and small -- and create opportunities for students that will be joining you on your campuses.\nWe’re committed to this mission.  As you've heard the President over the course of his campaign, and now you've seen him firsthand today, this President has a passion for equality of opportunity.  He has a passion for expanding opportunities and the hopes and dreams of every American, including those in the African American community who are not yet experiencing the full range of benefits of the American Dream.\nSo get ready for a great and energetic partnership in the days ahead.  As Frederick Douglass reminds us, education is the means -- or education means the lifting up of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth.  Powerful words -- “uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth.”  That's what your institutions have been about for now a century and a half in America.\nAnd so I came to say thank you on behalf of the President of the United States.  Thank you for all you do.  Beyond the profound words that I quoted before, when I look at the role of historically black colleges and universities, I can't help but think of even more ancient words that:  If you train up a child in the way they should go, then after they’re old, they’ll not depart from it.\nThe contributions of historically black colleges and universities for a century and a half in our nation’s history have trained up young men and women who have gone on to lead this nation and to lead us to a more prosperous and more perfect union.  And our commitment to all of you and our hope and our prayer is that we're going to partner with you that that will be even more true; and your contribution and your influence in America will only grow in the years ahead.\nThank you very much.  God bless you for your work.  And thank you for coming today.  (Applause.)\nEND\n5:47 P.M.

frustrations with waiting for permission from the federal government and agencies -- and I understand that, and I've had many people tell me about it, and it's been catastrophic for some of your states.  You know your citizens and you know they want things done.  But they don’t get things done and it's not your fault.  Sometimes it's your fault, but they understand that.  But sometimes it's

the right thing.  We're going to be protecting people environmentally and safety-wise, but we're going to be moving it quickly, very quickly.  (Applause.)\nAnd speaking of that, I know many of you -- and I've spoken to some of you last night about it -- have many projects that are -- I mean, just literally tied up because of environmental concerns, and it's been in for years and years and years the project your state wants, great for employment -- everybody wants them -- and they couldn’t get them out of environmental protection.  And we will get them out.  Now, that doesn’t mean they’re going to be approved, but they'll be rejected quickly one way or the other.  They'll be either rejected quickly or they're going to get approved.  I would say most will be approved, but you're going to know you're not going to wait nine years or eleven years -- some of the horror stories that I've heard.\nUnder my administration, we're going to have a true partnership of collaboration and cooperation.  We will get to the answers and we will get them quickly, and the flexibility you need to implement the reforms that you are going to have in order to make decision-making proper and decision-making fast.  So we're going to do both those things -- proper and fast.\nOne of the most important responsibilities for the federal government is the budget of the United States.  My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month.  This budget will be a public safety and national security budget, very much based on those two with plenty of other things, but very strong.  And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.  (Applause.)\nAnd you'll be hearing about that tomorrow night in great detail.  This is a landmark event, a message to the world, in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve.  We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight in our name only do one thing:  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.\nI have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say \"we haven’t lost a war\" -- we never lost a war -- you remember.  Some of you were right there with me, and you remember we never lost a war.  America never lost.  And now we never win a war.  We never win.  And we don’t fight to win.  We don’t fight to win.  So we either got to win, or don’t fight it at all.  But where we are -- 17 years -- almost 17 years of fighting in the Middle East.  I saw a chart the other day -- as of about a month ago, $6 trillion we've spent in the Middle East -- $6 trillion.  And I want to tell you, that's just unacceptable.  And we're nowhere.  Actually, if you think about it, we're less than nowhere.  The Middle East is far worse than it was 16, 17 years ago.  There's not even a contest.  So we've spent $6 trillion.  We have a hornet's nest.  It's a mess like you've never seen before.  We're nowhere.  So we're going to straighten it out.\nThis defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government.  We’re going to do more with less.  I got involved in an airplane contract, I got involved in some other contracts, and we cut the hell out of the prices.  I mean, we saved a lot of money, tremendous amount of money, beyond anything that the generals that were involved -- they said they’d never seen anything like this before.\nOn one plane, on a small order of one plane, I saved $725 million.  And I would say I devoted about, if I added it up, all those calls, probably about an hour.  So I think that might be my highest and best use.  (Laughter.)  Because if we can do that, our budget will be -- might be my highest and best.  (Applause.)\nAnd there are many other places; it’s all the same.  And in one way, that's a good thing because we have an answer.  And David is going to do a fantastic job at the VA.  I see David is sitting there, shaking his head.  Stand up, David.  (Applause.)  So we can't get our people through Cabinet, but he went through -- was it 95 to nothing?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN:  A hundred to zero.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How the hell did you do that?  (Laughter.)  Boy, oh boy.  He must be good.  You were the one.  One hundred to zero, wow.  Chose you -- hey, we can do it.  But we do -- we have still quite a few Cabinet members, and they're just in limbo waiting and waiting.  It’s like obstruction.  It’s obstruction.  But eventually we'll get them, and they'll put their people in, and we’ll get those agencies, et cetera, to work.\nWe’re going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people.  We can do so much more with the money we spend.  With $20 trillion in debt -- can you imagine that -- the government must learn to tighten its belt, something families all across the country have had to learn to do, unfortunately.  But they've had to learn to do it, and they’ve done it well.\nMy budget increases spending, and the increase in all spending, for federal law enforcement also.  And activities having to do with law enforcement will be substantially increased.  And we will fight violent crime.  If you look at what’s happening in our cities, you look at what’s happening in Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago -- we will fight violent crime, and we will win.  And we’ll win that one fairly quickly.  Once we give the local police, the local law enforcement the right to go in and fight it, and we back them monetarily and also otherwise, we’re going to win that one.  We're going to win it fairly quickly, I believe.\nMy budget also puts America first by keeping tax dollars in America to help veterans and first responders.  So important.  This budget follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping out terrorists, keeping out criminals, and putting violent offenders behind bars, or removing them from our country altogether.  And I must say that we’ve been treated very well -- very, very well -- on the job that General Kelly has done at the border.  It’s tough, it’s strong.\nI was talking last night to Terry McAuliffe, and he said, you have to mention this -- because he met with -- where is Terry?  He’s around here someplace.  Terry -- he met with General Kelly, and I think I can say you were impressed with General Kelly.  And he said, you have to get the point out that they’re removing the bad ones.  And that’s where our focus is -- it’s the bad ones.  We’re getting some very, very bad players out of this country -- drug lords, gang members, heads of gangs, killers, murderers -- we’re getting them out.  That’s what we’re focused on.\nThe press isn’t covering that, unfortunately, but it’s something that is very important.  We’re getting the bad ones out.  And that’s always where I said I was going to start.  I was going to start with these bad players.  And they are bad.  They are rough and tough, and we’re getting them the hell out of our country, and we’re bringing them to where they started out.  Let their country do what they have to do with them.\nSo the budget, which is going to be a very big part of tomorrow night’s speech, it’s going to be I think a budget of great rationality.  But it’s going to have to do with military, safety, economic development, and things such as that.  Great detail tomorrow night.\nWe’re also going to do whatever we can to restore the authority of the states when that is the appropriate thing to do.  We’re going to give you back a lot of the powers that have been taken away from states and great people and great governors.  And you can control it better than the federal government because you’re right on top of it.  You have something that’s controllable.  So I think that’s going to be very important.  You see that already taking effect.\nWe have to let the states compete and to see who has the best solutions.  They know the best how to spend their dollars and how to take care of the people within each state.  And the states are different, and people are different.  So the governors are going to have a lot more decision-making ability than they have right now.\nAll states will benefit from our economic agenda.  We will reduce taxes very, very substantially, and simplify the tax code.  We’re also going to make taxes between countries much more fair.  We’re one of the only countries in the world that people can sell their product into us and have no tax, no nothing, and they get rich.  And yet if you want to do business with them, you’ll have taxes, I’ve seen, as high as 100 percent.  So they sell into us, no problem; we sell into them -- because we don’t sell them because the tax is so high that they don’t want us to sell into them.\nSo I know that’s always been a point of contention, but to me it’s just fair.  It’s just fair.  It’s reciprocal.  It’s fair.  And so we’re going to be doing a lot of work on that, and that’s becoming a very, very important factor -- fairness.  Because I believe in free trade.  I want so much trade -- somebody said, oh, maybe he’s a total nationalist -- which I am, in a true sense -- but I want trade.  I want great trade between countries.\nBut the word “free” is very deceiving, because it’s good for them, it’s not good for us.  I want fair trade.  And if we’re going to be taxed, they should be taxed at the same amount, the other countries.  And one of two things is going to happen:  We’re going to make a lot of money or the other country is going to get rid of its tax.  And that’s good, too, because now the product, like Harley-Davidson -- I was talking to them -- the product will now flow into other countries where right now they can’t do it.\nSo we’re going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure, and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on infrastructure.  We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads.  I have a friend who is in the trucking business.  He said, my trucks are destroyed going from New York to Los Angeles.  They’re destroyed.  He said, I’m not going to get the good trucks.  He always prided himself on buying the best equipment.  He said, the roads are so bad that, by the time we make the journey from New York to Los Angeles or back, he said the equipment is just beat to hell.  I said, when has it been like that before?  He said, it’s never -- he’s been in the business for 40 years -- he said it’s never been like that.  Forty years -- never been like that.  So we’re going to take care of that.\nInfrastructure -- we’re going to start spending on infrastructure big.  And it's not like we have a choice.  It’s not like, oh, gee, let’s hold it off.  Our highways, our bridges are unsafe.  Our tunnels -- I mean, we have tunnels in New York where the tiles are on the ceiling, and you see many tiles missing.  And you wonder, you know, you’re driving at 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel.  Take a look at the Lincoln Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, and you’re driving, and you see all this loose material that’s heavy.  And it was made many years ago, so it’s heavy.  Today, it’s light.  It used to be better.  The problem is, you got to hold it up.  And I say to myself -- every time I drive through, I say, I wonder how many people are hurt or injured when they are driving at 40, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel, and the tile falls off.  And there are so many missing tiles and such loose concrete.  So we have to fix our infrastructure.  It’s not like we have a choice.  We have no choice, and we’re going to do it, and it also happens to mean jobs, which is a good thing.\nWe’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and get states the flexibility that they need to make the end result really, really good for them.  A very complicated issue.  We have Tom Price, just got confirmed -- sitting here.  (Applause.)  Stand up, Tom.  And I spent a lot of time with Governor Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other day -- we were talking about it.  They’re really very expert on the subject, and I want to thank them.  They spent a lot of time with me.  Governor Christie who's here someplace.  Where's Chris?  Governor Christie, thank you.  And so we have a lot of talent and a lot of expertise here, I will tell you.  And we have come up with a solution that’s really, really, I think, very good.\nNow, I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject.  Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated.  And statutorily and for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do healthcare before we do the tax cut.  The tax cut is going to be major, it’s going to be simple, and the whole tax plan is wonderful.  But I can’t do it until we do healthcare because we have to know what the healthcare is going to cost.  And, statutorily, that’s the way it is.  So for those people that say, oh, gee, I wish we could do the tax first -- it just doesn’t work that way.  I would like to do that first.  It’s actually -- tax cutting has never been that easy, but it’s a tiny, little ant compared to what we’re talking about with Obamacare.\nAnd you have to remember -- and I say this to Democrats in the room -- of which we have many -- Obamacare has failed.  If you go to Minnesota, where they had a 66-percent increase, and the governor of Minnesota, who is with us today, said, Obamacare -- the Affordable Care Act -- is no longer affordable -- something to that effect.  I think that might be it exactly.  But the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.  Obamacare has failed.\nI say to the Republicans, if you really want to do politically something good, don’t do anything.  Sit back for a period of two years, because ’17 is going to be a disaster -- a disaster -- for Obamacare if we don’t do something.  Let it be a disaster because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room, and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama.  Let it implode, and then let it implode in ’18 even worse.  Don’t do anything, and they will come begging for us to do something.  But that’s not the fair thing to do for the people.  It’s not the fair thing.\nPolitically, I think it would be a great solution, because as soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing -- just a tiny, little change -- what’s going to happen?  They’re going to say, it’s the Republicans’ problem.  That’s the way it is.  But we have to do what’s right because Obamacare is a failed disaster.\nAnd it’s interesting, it’s sort of like, when you see -- you see it with politicians, you see it with President Obama -- when you know he's getting out of office and the clock is ticking, and he's not going to be there, his approval rating goes way up, even though, you know, not that active in the last period of time.  The approval rating goes up.  That’s not him; that's like almost everybody.  I see it happening with Obamacare.  People hate it, but now they see that the end is coming, and they're saying, oh, maybe we love it.  There’s nothing to love.  It’s a disaster, folks, okay?  So you have to remember that.\nAnd, very importantly, we are going to work to restore local control to our nation’s education system.  Betsy is here someplace, and she is going to be, I think, fantastic.  (Applause.)  I think she's going to be fantastic.  Stand up, Betsy.  Betsy feels so strongly, and she has had such support from so many people.  You know, you don’t see that too much because you see the anti, you never see the positive.  But I can tell you, I’ve had so many calls while she was going through that horrible process.  That was a tough, tough, nasty process.  And she hung in, she was as strong as you get.  But so many people were calling Betsy, saying you will do such a fantastic job once you get it.\nIt’s like sometimes I'd say, it’s much tougher to get into Harvard than it is to stay there.  Does that make sense?  It’s tougher to get into the Wharton School of Finance -- you can’t get in.  But if you get in, it’s fine, you get through, right?  I think you’re going to do a fantastic job, and we’re very proud of you.  And you took a lot of heat, but you’re going to do great.  So she wants to bring decision-making powers back to parents, back to the families and back to the states, where they can really control education.\nAnd just finally, I’m looking forward to working with you on these projects and so much more.  We’re going to do these projects and so many more.  And I thank you all again for being here.  It’s going to be a really productive discussion -- so productive that I’m going to ask the press to start leaving because I wouldn’t want them to see any great, productive session.  (Laughter.)  But they'll be seeing it and hearing about it.\nAgain, thank you very much all for being at the White House.  We’ll do this many times.  I want the opinions of the governors of the states of the United States.  So I want to just thank you all for being here, and let’s take some questions, okay?  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nEND\n10:05 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You are the big ones.  You are the biggest of the big, right?  (Laughter.)  That’s very impressive.  Thank you for being here.  We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that Obamacare is having.  We’re going to change it and straighten it out, and make -- we have a plan that’s going to be, I think, fantastic.  It will be released fairly soon.  We’ll be talking about it tomorrow night during the speech.  But I think it’s going to be something special, and we’ll talk it about right here.  I think we’ll get you on, and I think you’re going to like what you hear.\nAgain, thank you for being here.  I want to thank also Secretary Tom Price who’s with us, and who’s doing a phenomenal job on a very complex subject, the subject of healthcare.  He’s an advocate for the patients.  Tom is all about the patients.  That’s what he wants.  He wants to have a great healthcare system.\nObamacare has been a disaster, and it’s only getting worse.  Last year alone, Obamacare premiums increased by double digits.  Since it has gone into effect, premiums are up by almost 100 percent in many areas.  And I think that this year it’s going to be really the year that I’ve always predicted -- ’17 is going to be a catastrophic year for Obamacare, for payments.  And you just take a look at what’s happening in various states like Arizona -- I believe it was up 116 percent; it’s going to be worse this year.\nObamacare forced providers to limit the plan options they offered to patients and caused them to drive prices way up.  Now, a third of United States counties are down to one insurer, and the insurers are fleeing.  You people know that better than anybody.\nSince Obamacare went into effect, nearly half of the insurers are stopped and have stopped from participating in the Obamacare exchanges.  It has gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty, or received an exemption rather than buy insurance.  That’s something that nobody has ever heard of or thought could happen, and they’re actually doing that rather than being forced to buy insurance.\nWe must work together to save Americans from Obamacare -- you people know that, and everyone knows that at this point -- to create more competition and to bring down the prices substantially.  The chaos that Obamacare has created, and for which congressional Democrats -- and you see that -- are alone and responsible for requires swift action.  I actually told the Republicans that if we did nothing, just do nothing for a two-year period, let Obamacare totally implode -- which it’s doing right now anyway -- that would be, from a political standpoint, the best thing we could do is to let it implode, and then people will come begging -- the Democrats will come begging to do something to help them out of the jam.\nOnce we start doing it, we sort of inherit the problem, we take over the problem, it becomes ours.  But it’s the right thing to do for the American people.  I think allowing this to go on -- this disaster to go on -- is a mistake.  So I’m asking Secretary Price to work with you to stabilize the insurance markets and to ensure a smooth transition to the new plan.  And the new plan will be a great plan for the patients, for the people, and hopefully for the companies.  It's going to be a very competitive plan.  And costs will come down, and I think the healthcare will go up very, very substantially.  I think people are going to like it a lot.\nWe’ve taken the best of everything we can take.  It’s our hope that Democrats will stop the obstruction and resistance.  And that’s what they have -- in fact, they have a sign, \"resist, resist.\"  They want to resist everything, including Cabinet members.  I have many Cabinet members that haven’t been approved yet, people that are extraordinary -- all of whom are going to be approved, but they just take forever.  It’s called obstruct and resist.  Hope I didn’t give them a new phrase, because their real phrase is “resist.”  I think I just gave them another word.  I shouldn’t have done that.  I’m good at branding.  (Laughter.)  You’re going to see them now come out, “obstruct and resist.”  All right, well, at least I can take credit for it.\nAnd they worked with us, and we are going to hopefully work with the Democrats, because ultimately we’re all people that love this country and we want to do the right thing, including reforms like expanded healthcare savings accounts, state flexibility, and the ability to purchase across state lines.  The state lines are so important for competition.  Everybody has wanted to do it for years.  What’s not to do?  So that’s going to be very important.\nI want to thank you all for being here.  I want to know and I want you to know that it’s an honor to do business with you.  It’s a great honor to have you in the White House.  And we look forward to providing healthcare that is that is extraordinary -- better than any other country anywhere in the world.  And we can do that.  We have the talent, we have the capacity, and we have the people.\nSo we’ll work on that together.  And maybe before the press leaves, you can just introduce yourself and your company, and the public will get to see what you're about.  And then if things aren’t working out, I’m blaming you anyway.  (Laughter.)\nSo we’ll start with Brad.\nMR. WILSON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here.  I’m Brad Wilson, president and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and pleased to represent our 3.9 million customers here today.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That's great, Brad.  Great job.\nMR. BERTOLINI:  Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Aetna -- good one.\nPARTICIPANT:  And I also represent America’s health insurance plans.  We represent all health insurance plans in Washington, D.C., including the plan to cover Medicaid managed care.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.\nMR. BROUSSARD:  Bruce Broussard, CEO of Humana.\nMR. GARRITY:  Pat Garrity, I’m the CEO of Florida Blue, the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the state of Florida.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.\nMR. HEMSLEY:  I’m Steve Hemsley from UnitedHealth Group.  We're a diversified health care company of about 230,000 employees.  We serve about 120 million Americans.  And we are contributing in terms of the jobs we've -- 35,000 in the last five years and 10,000 in the coming year.  We're a mission-driven enterprise, help people live healthier lives, and make the system work for everyone.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good, thank you very much.\nMR. CORDANI:  Mr. President, David Cordani from Cigna Corporation.  We're a global health service company.\nMR. SEROTA:  Scott Serota, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.  We represent 108 million subscribers.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  108 million, that's a pretty big deal, right?\nMR. SEROTA:  Yes, it is.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Pretty big.\nMR. SWEDISH:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I’m Joe Swedish with Anthem.  We're in 14 states, representing 40 percent of the American public.  We have 40 million members, and we've been involved in the individual (inaudible) for probably seven decades, and deeply embedded in the Affordable Care Act situation that has evolved over the last three years.  I don't want to miss the opportunity to thank you for the swift and decisive action that occurred most recently regarding some adjustments that have occurred in and around --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We had to step in.\nMR. SWEDISH:  Thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was going to be an implosion.  We had to step in.  Thank you for saying that.\nMR. SWEDISH:  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.\nMR. TYSON:  I’m Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, better known as Kaiser Permanente.  We cover 11.7 million Americans.  We also are an integrated delivery system, so we both provide the coverage and the care.  We have Permanente medical groups that contract exclusively with Kaiser Foundation Health Plan.  And we're proud to care for 11.7 million people.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bernard.\nMR. HILFERTY:  Mr. President, I’m Dan Hilferty.  I’m based in Philadelphia with Independence Blue Cross, Independence Health Group.  We're in 32 states and the District of Columbia and a large Medicaid managed care population.\nWe're the only player on the exchange in the five-county Philadelphia area.  And again, I’d like to echo Joe’s point.  We were thrilled with the initial steps to stabilize the market.  We look forward to working with you, Vice President Pence, Secretary Price in making sure that we have a sustainable program for years to come.  So thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And the market, as you know, and we talk about stabilizing the market -- the market is disastrous.  It’s going to absolutely implode.  That's why we're meeting today.  And I think we're going to come up with something where not only will the market be great, but the people are going to be taken care of.  So we will work that out I think quite easily, actually.\nThank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.\nEND\n11:12 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  I want to just congratulate the First Lady on having done a really beautiful job.  The room, they say, has never looked better, but who knows.  I’m sure it’s looked very good many times.  So, Melania, congratulations.  (Applause.)\nI also want to congratulate and thank a truly great Vice President of the United States, and his wonderful wife, Karen.  And wherever you are, Mike, stand up just for a second.  Mike Pence.  (Applause.)\nSo I can say that after four weeks -- they were a lot of fun -- but we’ve accomplished almost everything we’ve started out to accomplish.  The borders are stricter, tighter.  We’re going a really good job.  General Kelly has does a fantastic job militarily.  As you know, we have a fantastic team.  We have an A team.  And I’m getting some good reports.  There are some big problems in the world -- you know that very well -- but we’re very happy with the way things are working.  And again, we’ve made a lot of promises over the last two years, and many of those promises already are kept.  So we’re very honored by that.  And I -- (applause) -- thank you, thank you.\nI just want to salute and toast the governors -- the great governors of the United States.  They have done an amazing job.  Such an easy job you have.  (Laughter.)  So easy.  But you have done a fantastic job, and your families and wives and -- well, everybody is here.  I mean, I’ve seen daughters come tonight.  I’ve seen wives.  I’ve seen -- all I know is, everybody is lovely, and we’re going to have a wonderful evening.\nAnd tomorrow, we’re going to meet, and we’re going to discuss things, like perhaps healthcare will come up.  Perhaps.  (Laughter.)  And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that.  And we’re going to have a speech on Tuesday night, and we’re going to be speaking very specifically about a very complicated subject.  Everybody is different, every state is different, and different requirements, but I think we have something that's going to really be excellent.\nAnd as most of you know, the Obamacare has had tremendous problems.  I won’t say in front of the Democrats, I’ll just say it to the Republicans -- (laughter) -- it doesn’t work.  But we’re going to have it fixed, and we’re going to repeal and replace.  And I think you’re going to see something very, very special.\nAnd for all of you, and even tonight, because we have Tom Price with us -- if you see something or want to discuss it, we don’t have to discuss all friendly stuff.  We can discuss a little bit of the healthcare.  We might as well start.  But tomorrow morning, we’re going to meet and have some pretty big sessions on healthcare and other things -- whatever is on your mind.\nSo I hear this is a record number of governors -- 46.  And that’s the highest number that have ever shown up for this evening.  (Applause.)  So, with that, I would like to toast the great, great governors of the United States.  Thank you.\n(A toast is offered.)\nNow, I know it’s inappropriate, but I’d like to ask a friend of mine -- I’ve just destroyed his political career -- (laughter) -- from the other side, a man from Virginia -- I’ve known him a long time, and he's a very good guy -- Governor Terry McAuliffe to come up and also, perhaps, make a toast.  Thank you.  Terry, where are you?  Come on up, Terry.  (Applause.)\nGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE:  Well, good evening.  Let me, first of all, on behalf of our nation’s governors, I want to thank the President and the First Lady.  We have found out this is the first big social dinner of the calendar, and I think they did that out of respect to our nation’s governors.  So if we give a great round of applause to the President and the First Lady.  (Applause.)\nNow, Mr. President, as you know, I am chairman of the National Governors Association, so I’m not sure if the 46 -- the largest crowd ever -- is due to my chairmanship or your presidency.  (Laughter.)  But tonight, in the spirit of bipartisanship, sir, we will both take credit for the greatest NGA meeting in the history of NGA meetings.  (Applause.)\nI also want to thank the Vice President of the United States and Mrs. Pence.  On Friday, for the first time ever, they opened the Vice Presidential Mansion -- the Naval Observatory -- to host the governors for lunch.  That had never been done before.  So if we could give a great round of applause to the Vice President and Karen Pence.  (Applause.)\nAnd let me just say, tomorrow we’re all going to meet, we’re going to discuss the issues tomorrow, but the one thing we all agree on -- all of us governors and this administration, what every governor wants -- we want good jobs.  We want a good economy.  We want the world-class education system in our respective states.  We want a healthcare delivery system that works, with great, quality healthcare, efficiently at a low cost.  We want people to get on our roads and our rail, and be able to ride around efficiently, and then go see their kids play a ballgame.  That’s what we all want.\nAnd, Mr. President, I thank you for having us here tonight.  We have a common goal:  We are the greatest nation in the globe.  And I want to toast to you, Mr. President, and just say, we want to work with you to build on those ideals that have instilled and brought all of us governors together, that we can respectively grow our states and grow our nation to be truly the great destiny that we are.  So I would like to offer a toast to the President of the United States of America.\n(A toast is offered.)\nEND\n7:35 P.M.

We are blessed by the lives and examples of those who have made this Nation a beacon of freedom, talent, and unbreakable American spirit.\nThis week, I had the privilege of visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture right here in Washington, D.C. It’s a new, beautiful Smithsonian museum that serves as a shining example of African Americans’ incredible contributions to our culture, our society, and our history. It also tells of the great struggle for freedom and equality that prevailed against the sins of slavery and the injustice of discrimination.\nThe work and love of the people who helped create such a masterpiece is a testament to the legacy of so many leaders it honors. I left that museum confident that together, America can overcome any challenge.\nThere’s a great quote by Muhammad Ali in the museum – “I shook up the world,” he said. And that is what he did. So did leaders like Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, and so many others. They shook up the world for the better because they inspired our Nation to march toward justice and freedom for all. Today, and every day, I pledge to continue that march so that every American – no matter his background, no matter her background – has the chance to climb that great ladder of success.\nIt was very special to accompany Dr. Ben Carson and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit. I am proud that soon he will serve in my cabinet as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. HUD has a very, very powerful meaning far beyond housing. It is about transforming our communities. About bringing back hope. And Ben will do a fantastic job.\nThat’s what I am committed to doing also. I want every African-American child, family, and worker to have access to great schools, safe communities, and good-paying jobs. I want every disadvantaged child in America to have a choice about where they go to school – so important. I also want to honor and promote the achievements of Historically Black Colleges and Universities throughout our Nation. They do a fantastic job. They are not given the credit that they deserve, and they are going to start getting that credit.\nIn order to help African Americans thrive, we are working very hard to make sure every child can grow up in a safe community – and have access to high-paying jobs.\nWe’ve lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries – and this has hurt the African American community very badly. This week I met with manufacturing CEOs – we’re going to be working to bring back those jobs, and I mean really good-paying jobs.\nI will be talking more about these issues in my Joint Session Address to Congress and to all Americans next Tuesday evening. I hope you will be watching.\nThank you, God bless you and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-02-25T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump’s Weekly Address"}

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  So great to be with you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nGreat to be back at CPAC.  (Applause.) The place I have really --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I love this place.  Love you people.  (Applause.)  So thank you.  Thank you very much.\nFirst of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp, and his very, very incredible wife and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters, and so great.  When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance.  So, I want to thank Matt and Mercedes.\nAnd when Matt called and asked, I said, absolutely, I'll be there with you.  I mean, the real reason I said it -- I didn’t want him to go against me because that one you can’t beat.  So I said, absolutely.  And it really is an honor to be here.\nI wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends.  These are my friends.  (Applause.)  And we’ll see you again next year and the year after that, and I’ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can, and I’ll make sure that we’re here a lot.\nYou know, if you remember, my first major speech -- sit down, everybody.  Come on.  (Applause.)  You know, the dishonest media, they’ll say he didn’t get a standing ovation.  You know why?  No, you know why?  Because everybody stood and nobody sat, so they will say he never got a standing ovation, right?  (Applause.)  They are the worst.\nAUDIENCE:  USA! USA! USA!  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So -- sit down.  (Laughter.)  Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.  They leave out the part, they never sat down.  They leave that out.  So I just want to thank -- but you know, my first major speech was at CPAC.  And probably five or six years ago -- first major political speech.  And you were there.\nAnd it was -- I loved it.  I love the people.  I love the commotion.  And then they did these polls where I went through the roof, and I wasn’t even running, right?  But it gave me an idea, and I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country, and I said, let’s go do it.  So it was very exciting.  I walked the stage on CPAC.  I’ll never forget it, really.  I had very little notes, and even less preparation.  So when you have practically no notes and no preparation, and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, I think I like this business.\nI would have come last year, but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial.  We wanted border security.  We wanted very, very strong military.  We wanted all of the things that we’re going to get, and people consider that controversial.  But you didn’t consider it controversial.  (Applause.)\nSo I’ve been with CPAC for a long time.  All of these years, we've been together.  And now you finally have a president.  Finally.  Took you a long time.  Took you a long time.  (Applause.)\nAnd it’s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me -- believe me.  You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children, and because you want to make America great again.  (Applause.)\nThe media didn't think we would win.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  They knew. (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The pundits -- you’re right.  They had an idea.  The pundits didn't think we would win.  The consultants that suck up all that money.  Oh, they suck it up, they’re so good.  (Laughter.)  They’re not good at politics, but they’re really good at sucking up people’s money.  Especially my opponent’s, because I kept them down to a minimum.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But the consultants didn’t think we would win.  But they all underestimated the power of the people -- you.  And the people proved them totally wrong.  Never -- and this is so true, and this is what’s been happening -- never underestimate the people.  Never.  I don’t think it will ever happen again.\nAnd I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.  It’s fake -- phony, fake.  (Applause.)  A few days ago, I called the fake news “the enemy of the people” -- and they are.  They are the enemy of the people.  Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none.  I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed.  There are no nine people.  I don’t believe there was one or two people.  Nine people.  And I said, give me a break.  Because I know the people.  I know who they talked to.  There were no nine people.  But they say, nine people, and somebody reads it and they think, oh, nine people.  They have nine sources.  They make up sources.\nThey are very dishonest people.  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people -- the fake news.  They dropped off the word “fake.”  And all of the sudden, the story became, the media is the enemy.  They take the word “fake” out, and now I’m saying, oh, no, this is no good.  But that’s the way they are.  So I’m not against the media.  I’m not against the press.  I don’t mind bad stories if I deserve them.  And I tell you, I love good stories, but we won’t -- (laughter) -- I don’t get too many of them.\nBut I am only against the fake news media or press -- fake, fake.  They have to leave that word.  I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.  They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name.  Let their name be put out there.  Let their name be put out.  (Applause.)  A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.  Let them say it to my face.  (Applause.)  Let there be no more sources.\nAnd remember this -- and in not all in all cases.  I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man.  It was a very fair story.  There are some great reporters around.  They’re talented, they’re honest as the day is long.  They’re great.  But there are some terrible, dishonest people, and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people.  A tremendous disservice.  They are very dishonest people, and they shouldn’t use sources.  They should put the name of the person.  You will see stories dry up like you’ve never seen before.\nSo you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story -- and I put myself in your position sometimes, because many of you, you’re not part of the story, and if you’re not part of the story, then you sort of know.  If you are part of the story, you know what they’re saying is true or not.  So when they make it up, and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election -- polls, polls.  The polls.  They come out with these polls, and everybody was so surprised.  Actually, a couple of polls got it right.  I must say, Los Angeles Times did a great job.  Shocking, because -- you know.  They did a great job.  (Applause.)  And we had a couple of others that were right.\nBut generally speaking, I mean, I can tell you the network.  Somebody said a poll came out.  And I say, what network is it?  And they’ll say, a certain -- let’s not even mention names right?  Should we?\nWell, you have a lot of them.  Look, the Clinton new network is one.  (Applause.)  Totally.  Take a look.  Honestly.  Take a look at their polls over the last two years.  Now, you would think they would fire the pollster, right?  After years and years of getting battered.  But I don’t -- I mean, who knows, maybe they’re just bad at polling.  Or maybe they’re not legit.  But it’s one or the other.  Look at how inaccurate -- look at CBS, look at ABC also.  Look at NBC.  Take a look at some of these polls.  They’re so bad, so inaccurate.\nAnd what that does is it creates a false narrative.  It creates like this narrative that’s just like we’re not going to win, and people say, \"Oh, I love Trump, but you know I’m not feeling great today.  He can’t win.  So I won’t go and vote.  I won’t go and vote.\"  It creates a whole false deal and we have to fight it folks.  We have to fight it.  They’re very smart, they’re very cunning, and they’re very dishonest.\nSo just to conclude -- I mean, it’s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories.  They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment.  You know, they always bring up the First Amendment.  (Laughter.)  And I love the First Amendment.  Nobody loves it better than me.  Nobody.  (Applause.)  I mean, who uses it more than I do?\nBut the First Amendment gives all of us -- it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives all Americans -- the right to speak our minds freely.  It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news, and criticize it strongly.  (Applause.)\nAnd many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it’s not your agenda, and it’s not the country’s agenda.  It’s their own agenda.  They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.  But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn’t tell the truth.  Doesn’t tell the truth.\nSo just in finishing, I say it doesn’t represent the people.  It never will represent the people.  And we’re going to do something about it, because we have to go out and we have to speak our minds, and we have to be honest.  Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.  (Applause.)  And I’m here fighting for you, and I will continue to fight for you.\nThe victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security, and the rule of law.  (Applause.)  Our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values.  (Applause.)  And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it’s time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag.  (Applause.)  Yeah, there we should stand up.  Come on.  (Applause.)  There we should stand up.  Okay.  (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, we love our flag.  By the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed -- there are lines that go back six blocks.  And I tell you that because you won’t read about it, okay?  (Laughter.)  But there are lines that go back six blocks.  There is such love in this country for everything we stand for.  You saw that on Election Day.  (Applause.)  And you’re going to see it more and more.  (Applause.)\nSo we’re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before.  There’s never been anything like this.  There’s been some movements, but there’s never been anything like this.  There’s been some movements that petered out, like Bernie -- petered out.  (Laughter.)  But it was a little rigged against him -- superdelegate, superdelegate.  She had so many delegates before the thing even started.  I actually said to my people, how does that happen?  (Laughter.)  Not that I’m a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump.  You know why?  Because he’s right on one issue:  Trade.  He was right about trade.\nOur country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals.  So he was right about that, but we’ve got a lot of Bernie support.  So actually, I like Bernie, okay?  I like Bernie.  (Applause.)\nBut I’m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican Party and for the future of America.\nFirst, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is, and what it actually represents.  The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first.  (Applause.)  For too long we’ve traded away our jobs to other countries -- so terrible.  We’ve defended other nations’ borders while leaving ours wide open; anybody can come in.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  A wall!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re going to build the wall, don’t worry about it.  We’re building the wall.  We’re building the wall.  In fact, it’s going to start soon, way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.  (Applause.)  Way, way, way ahead of schedule.  It’s going to start very soon.  General Kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job.  Fantastic job he’s done.  (Applause.)\nAnd remember, we are getting the bad ones out.  These are bad dudes.  We’re getting the bad ones out, okay?  We’re getting the bad -- if you watch these people it’s like, oh, gee, that’s so sad.  We’re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn’t be -- whether it’s drugs or murder or other things.  We’re getting bad ones out.  Those are the ones that go first, and I said it from day one.  Basically all I’ve done is keep my promise.  (Applause.)\nWe’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay.  In the Middle East, we’ve spent as of four weeks ago $6 trillion.  Think of it.  And, by the way, the Middle East is in what -- I mean, it’s not even close -- it’s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago.  If our Presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.  (Applause.)  Yeah, a hell of a lot better.  We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.\nThis is the situation that I inherited.  I inherited a mess, believe me.  We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe.\nNow, I’ve been watching -- and nobody says it -- but Obamacare doesn’t work, folks.  I mean, I could say -- I could talk -- it doesn’t work.  And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you’re watching, they’re not you.  They’re largely -- many of them are the side that lost.  You know, they lost the election.  It’s like, how many elections do we have to have?  They lost the election.  (Laughter.)\nBut I always say, Obamacare doesn’t work.  And these same people two years, and a year ago, were complaining about Obamacare.  And the bottom line:  We’re changing it.  We’re going to make it much better.  We’re going to make it less expensive.  We’re going to make it much better.  Obamacare covers very few people.\nAnd remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved, that was taken away from them; was taken away from them.  (Applause.)  Millions of people were very happy with their health care.  They had their doctor, they had their plan.  Remember the lie -- 28 times.  “You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan” -- over and over and over again you heard it.\nSo we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  (Applause.)  And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we’re working with very hard -- Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy -- but I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single-best thing we can do is nothing.  Let it implode completely -- it’s already imploding.  You see the carriers are all leaving.  I mean, it’s a disaster.\nBut two years don’t do anything.  The Democrats will come to us and beg for help.  They’ll beg, and it’s their problem.  But it’s not the right thing to do for the American people.  It’s not the right thing to do.  (Applause.)\nWe inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years.  Think of it -- $20 trillion.  It’s doubled.  And we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another.  We don’t win anymore.  When was the last time we won?  Did we win a war?  Do we win anything?  Do we win anything?  We’re going to win.  We’re going to win big, folks.  We’re going to start winning again, believe me.  We’re going to win.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But we’re taking a firm, bold and decisive measure -- we have to -- to turn things around.  The era of empty talk is over.  It’s over.  (Applause.)  Now is the time for action.  So let me tell you about the actions that we’re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people, and on my promise to make America great again.\nWe’ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of great, great border wall.  (Applause.)  And with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this -- our Border Patrol, I’ll tell you what they do.  They came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me.  They never endorsed a presidential candidate before.  They might not even be allowed to.  (Laughter.)  But they were disgusted with what they saw.\nAnd we’ll stop it.  We’ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth.  (Applause.)  Pouring in, pouring in.  We get the drugs, they get the money.  We get the problems, they get the cash.  No good, no good.  Going to stop.\nBy stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that's so important because the tax -- the dollars that we're losing are beyond anything that you can imagine.  And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities -- including our inner cities.  (Applause.)\nWe are also going to save countless American lives.  As we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens, and throwing them the hell out of our country.  (Applause.)  And we will not let them back in.  They're not coming back in, folks.  (Applause.)  If they do, they're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.\nI'm also working with the Department of Justice to begin reducing violent crime.  I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago, as an example?  Two days ago, seven people were shot --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  It's Iraq!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  -- and, I believe, killed.  Seven people.  Seven people.  Chicago, a great American city.  Seven people shot and killed.\nWe will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And thank them.  I've also followed through on my campaign promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- (applause) -- so that we can protect our economic freedom.  And we are going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one-on-one, one-on-one.  And if they misbehave, we terminate the deal.  And then they'll come back, and we'll make a better deal.  (Applause.)  None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.  Just take a look -- by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made  by any country having to do with economic development.  It's economic undevelopment as far as our country is concerned.\nWe're preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.  (Applause.)  We're going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality healthcare they need and deserve.\nWe have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.  (Applause.)  And issued a new rule.  This took place while I was getting ready to sign.  I said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline?  Well, sir, it comes from all over the world, isn't that wonderful?  I said, nope, it comes from the United States or we're not building one.  (Applause.)  American steel.   If they want a pipeline in the United States, they're going to use pipe that's made in the United States, do we agree?  (Applause.)\nBut can you imagine -- I told this story the other day -- can you imagine the gentleman -- never met him, don't even know the name of his company.  I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct.  Big, big, powerful company.  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline -- same thing with the Dakota, different place.  They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.\nBut with the Keystone -- so they spend hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, you know, sucking the blood out of the company -- \"don't worry, I use them all my life; okay, don't worry, we're going to get it approved, I'm connected, I'm a lobbyist, don't worry.\"  Bottom line, Obama didn't sign it.  Could be 42,000 jobs -- somewhere around there.  A lot of jobs.  Didn't sign it.  But can you imagine -- he gave up.  A year ago it was dead.\nNow he's doing nothing, calling his wife, \"Hello, darling, I'm a little bored, you know that pipeline?\"  That has killed us, that has killed our company.  Knock, knock.  \"Mr. so-and-so, the Keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere, has just been approved.\"  (Applause.)  Now, can you imagine the expression?  And you know the sad part?  The same bloodsucking consultants that hit him for all the money and failed?  They're now going to go back to him and say, didn't we do a great job?  We want more money, right, because that's the way the system works.  A little bit off, but that's the way the system works.\nWe're preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and beautiful clean coal, and we're going to put our miners back to work.  (Applause.)  Miners are going back to work.  (Applause.)  Miners are going back to work, folks.  Sorry to tell you that, but they're going back to work.\nWe have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy -- crushing.  And not only our economy, crushing our jobs, because companies can't hire.  We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, I want regulation.  I want to protect our environment.  I want regulations for safety.  I want all of the regulations that we need, and I want them to be so strong and so tough.  But we don't need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us noncompetitive overseas with other companies from other countries.  That, we don't need.  But we're going to have regulations.  It's going to be really strong and really good, and we're going to protect our environment, and we're going to protect the safety of our people and our workers.  (Applause.)\nAnother major promise is tax reform.  We are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business, and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business.  (Applause.)\nIn anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country -- you see that.  In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-President -- they say President-elect.  President-elect is meeting with Ford, he's meeting with Chrysler, he's meeting with General Motors.  I just wanted to save a little time.  (Laughter.)  Because Ford and Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers.  And they're going back to Michigan, and they're going back to Ohio, and they're going back to Pennsylvania, and they're going back to North Carolina, and to Florida.  (Applause.)\nIt's time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work.  You're going to love it!  You're going to love it.  You are going to love it.  (Applause.)\nWe're also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military.  (Applause.)  And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military -- all of our military.  Offensive, defensive, everything.  Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.  And hopefully, we'll never have to use it.  But nobody is going to mess with us, folks.  Nobody.  (Applause.)\nIt will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history.  No one will dare to question -- as they have been, because we're very depleted, very, very depleted.  Sequester.  Sequester.  Nobody will dare question our military might again.  We believe in peace through strength, and that's what we will have.  (Applause.)\nAs part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS.  (Applause.)  Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.  (Applause.)\nAt the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security.  Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country.  (Applause.)  And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks.  Take a look at what's happening in Europe.  I took a lot of heat on Sweden.  (Laughter.)  And then a day later, I said, has anybody reported what's going on?  And it turned out that they didn't -- not too many of them did.  (Laughter.)  Take a look at what happened in Sweden.  I love Sweden.  Great country.  Great people.  I love Sweden.  But they understand I'm right.  The people over there understand I'm right.  Take a look at what's happening in Sweden.  Take a look at what's happening in Germany.  Take a look at what's happened in France.  Take a look at Nice and Paris.\nI have a friend -- he's a very, very substantial guy.  He loves the City of Lights.  He loves Paris.  For years, every year, during the summer, he would go to Paris -- it was automatic -- with his wife and his family.  I hadn’t seen him in a while.  And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question:  How’s Paris doing?  \"Paris?  I don’t go there anymore.  Paris is no longer Paris.\"  That was four years -- four, five years -- hasn’t gone there.  He wouldn’t miss it for anything.  Now he doesn’t even think in terms of going there.  Take a look at what’s happening to our world, folks, and we have to be smart.  We have to be smart.  We can’t let it happen to us.  (Applause.)\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can:  We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.  (Applause.)  We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect out people and keep America safe.  You will see the action.  (Applause.)\nI will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people.  I won’t do it.  (Applause.)  If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it’s okay.  It doesn’t bother me.  The security of our people is number one -- is number one.  (Applause.)  Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don’t have my Cabinet approved.  Nobody mentions that.  Do you know I still have people out there waiting to be approved?  And everyone knows they're going to be approved.  It’s just a delay, delay, delay.  It’s really sad.  It’s really sad.  And these are great people.  These are some great people.  We still don’t have our Cabinet.  I assume we’re setting records for that.  That’s the only thing good about it is we’re setting records.  I love setting records.  (Applause.)  But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats.  I said, Democrats, please, approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care too, if you don’t mind.  (Applause.)\nBut we’re taking meetings every day with top leaders in business, in science, and industry.  Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office -- Caterpillar tractor, Campbell’s Soup.  We had everybody.  We had everybody.  I like Campbell’s Soup.  (Laughter and applause.)  We had everybody, and we came to a lot of very good conclusions, and a lot of those folks that are in that room are going to be building big, big massive new plants, and lots of jobs.  And you know what?  They’re going to be building them in this country, not in some other country.  (Applause.)\nWe’re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement, and we’re meeting with leaders from all around the world, where the White House doors used to be totally closed -- they were closed, folks.  You don’t realize that.  They were closed.  They’re now wide open.  And they’re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work.  (Applause.)\nAnd when they come into the White House, we’re translating these meetings into action.  One by one, we’re checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States.  One by one -- a lot of promises.  And we will not stop until the job is done.  We will reduce your taxes.  We will cut your regulations.  We will support our police.  We will defend our flag.  (Applause.)  We will rebuild our military.  We will take care of our great, great veterans.  We’re taking care of our veterans.  (Applause.)\nWe will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good -- none of them.  You wonder, where did the people come from that negotiated these deals?  Where did they come from?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Government.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest with you.  They’re not as stupid as you think.  (Laughter.)\nWe will cut wasteful spending.  We will promote our values.  We will rebuild our inner cities.  We will bring back our jobs and our dreams.  So true.  (Applause.)  So true.\nAnd, by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.  (Applause.)  You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA, and they didn’t have that on the list.  It’s lucky I thought about it.  (Laughter.)  But we will indeed.  And they’re great people.  And by the way, they love our country.  They love our country.  The NRA has been a great supporter.  They love our country.\nThe forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer.  That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party.  People came to vote, and these people -- the media -- they said, where are they coming from?  What’s going on here?  These are hardworking, great, great Americans.  These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly.  Hillary called them “deplorable”.  They’re not deplorable.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo -- lock her up!  Lock her up!  Lock her up!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly.  That’s the problem in politics.  One wrong word and it’s over.  She also said irredeemable, but we won’t mention that.\nThe GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker.  (Applause.)  You know, we haven’t been, as a group, given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle.  During the early days when we had 17 people running -- the primaries -- millions and millions of people were joining.  Now, I won’t say it was because of me, but it was, okay.  (Applause.)\nAnd we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it.  And it’s going to see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me.  A lot sooner than you think.  (Applause.)\nWe will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me.  Global cooperation -- dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries -- is good.  It’s very important.  But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag.  This is the United States of America that I’m representing.  I’m not representing the globe.  I’m representing your country.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  USA! USA! USA!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America.  America -- it’s the allegiance to America.\nNo matter our background, or income, or geography, we are all citizens of this blessed land.  And no matter our color, or the blood, the color of the blood we bleed, it’s the same red blood of great, great patriots.  Remember.  Great patriots.  (Applause.)\nWe all salute, with pride, the same American Flag.  And we are equal -- totally equal -- in the eyes of Almighty God.  We’re equal.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nAnd I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the Christian community.  (Applause.)  Communities of faith -- rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers -- because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentages of those numbers that voted for Trump.  So I want to thank you folks.  It was amazing -- an amazing outpouring, and I will not disappoint you.\nAs long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal, at all, beyond our reach.  There is no dream too large, no task too great.  We are Americans, and the future belongs to us.  The future belongs to all of you.  (Applause.)  And America is coming about, and it’s coming back, and it’s roaring and you can hear it.  It’s going to be bigger and better.  It is going to be.  It is going to be.  Remember.  And it’s roaring.  It’s going to be bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.  (Applause.)\nI want to thank you.  And Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have.  I see them.  They’re all over the place.  You are really great people.  I want to thank you.\nAnd I want to say to you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  Thank you, folks.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n11:04 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all very much for being here.  We have tremendous people standing behind me, and the biggest in the world in terms of manufacturing and business.  Some of the people involved are Ken Fisher and Ken Frazier, Chairman and President, CEO of Merck.  Alex Gorsky, Chairman, CEO of Johnson and Johnson.  Marillyn Hewson -- and she has been very tough to deal with but that’s okay -- (laughter) -- she’s a very tough negotiator, President of Lockheed Martin.  Gregory Hayes, Chairman and CEO, United Technology.  Andrew Liveris, my friend Andrew, Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical Company.  Mario Longhi, the President, CEO, United States Steel Corporation.  Juan Luciano, Chairman, President, CEO of Archer Daniels Midland Company.  Denise Morrison, President of Campbell’s Soup Company.  Lee Styslinger III, Chairman and CEO of Altec, Inc.  Mark Sutton, Chairman, CEO of International Paper.  And Inge Thulin, Chairman, President of 3M Company.\nAnd we have made tremendous progress with these great business leaders -- amazing progress.  They’re getting together in groups and they’re coming up with suggestions about their companies and how to bring jobs back to the United States.  And I think it will be a fantastic day for the country.\nAnd we met yesterday, and -- I met with these folks and some more.  Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before.  Although, I must say, I think we’ve stopped it to a large part, Marillyn, right?\nMS. HEWSON:  Right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Reducing wages and raising prices.  I’ve listened to American companies and American workers.  I’ve been listening to them for a long time.  I’ve been listening to them complain for a long time.  But today, this executive order directs each agency to establish a regulatory reform task force, which will ensure that every agency has a team of dedicated -- and a real team of dedicated people to research all regulations that are unnecessary, burdensome and harmful to the economy, and therefore harmful to the creation of jobs and business.\nEach task force will make recommendations to repeal or simplify existing regulations.  The regulatory burden is for the people behind me and for the great companies of this country, and for small companies -- an impossible situation, we’re going to solve it very quickly.  They will also have to really report every once in a while to us so we can report on the progress, and so we can come up with some even better solutions.\nThis executive order is one of many ways we’re going to get real results when it comes to removing job-killing regulations and unleashing economic opportunity.  We’ve already issued an order which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  So that in itself is going to be tremendous, but what we’re doing is much more than even that.\nEvery regulation should have to pass a simple test:  Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers?  If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it and getting rid of it quickly.  We will stop punishing companies for doing business in the United States.  It’s going to be absolutely just the opposite.  They’re going to be incentivized for doing business in the United States.\nWe’re working very hard to roll back the regulatory burdens so that coal miners, factory workers, small-business owners, and so many others can grow their businesses and thrive.  We cannot allow government to be an obstacle to government opportunity.  We are going to bring back jobs and create more opportunities to prosper, maybe more than ever before in our country.  We’ve made tremendous strides over the last short period of time.  This is -- I guess we’re four weeks into it.  I think for four weeks I’ve done a good job, wouldn’t you say?  (Laughter.)\nBut again, I want to thank these great business leaders.  Some of them are with us and the White House, and they’ve had tremendous success -- Reed and Jared and so many others -- in business.  And they’re helping us sort out what’s going on, because really, for many years, even beyond -- long beyond Obama, President Obama -- I will say that it’s been disastrous for business.  This is going to be a place for business to do well and to thrive.\nAnd so with the signing of this executive order, I would like to just congratulate everybody behind me.  And, Andrew, I’d like to thank you for initially getting the group together.\nMR. LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Really a fantastic job you’ve done.\nMR. LIVERIS:  Thank you.\n(The executive order is signed.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Should I give this pen to Andrew?  Dow Chemical.  (Laughter.)  I think maybe, right?  (Applause.)\nMR LIVERIS:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That means a lot of jobs.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.\nEND\n12:12 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  It's a great honor to have everybody.  And some of the great people in the world of business, many of you I know -- many of you I know from reading all of our wonderful magazines and business magazines, in particular.  So it's an honor to have you with us today.\nBringing manufacturing back to America, creating high-wage jobs was one of our campaign promises and themes, and it resonated with everybody.  It was really something what happened.  States that hadn’t been won in many, many years were -- they came over to our fold.  A lot of it had to do with the jobs, and other reasons -- but jobs.  And I'm delivering on everything that we've said.  In fact, people are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.  We've delivered on a lot.  And I think Mark can explain, and Mark can probably say some of the things we're doing for the auto industry.  We're going to be doing for many of the industries.\nAs you know, the United States lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.  That's an unbelievable number and statistic.  And 70,000 factories closed since China joined the WTO -- 70,000 factories.  So when I used to give that statistic, I used to talk about and I always thought it was a typo.  I said, it has to be a typo.  I tell Wilbur -- Wilbur, that can't be right -- 70,000.  Think of it, 70,000 factories.  So you say, what are we doing?  My administration's policies and regulatory reform, tax reform, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country.  Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back, the good jobs, the real jobs.  They've left, and they're coming back.  They have to come back.\nYou've already seen companies such as Intel, Ford.  Mark has been great.  GM, Walmart, Amgen, Amazon, Fiat -- they came the other day; they're going to make a tremendous investment in the country.  Carrier and many others announced significant new investments in the United States.  For example, Ford is doing 700 million in Michigan, creating 700 new jobs -- is a vote of confidence.  It was actually stated a vote of confidence.  We have many other companies doing the same thing.  Carrier, as you know -- and I got involved very late, almost like by two years late -- but many of the jobs that were leaving for Mexico, they're bringing back at least 800 jobs they're bringing back.  And they actually never got to leave.  I have no idea what they did with the plant in Mexico, but we'll have to ask them, because it was largely built.\nGeneral Motors is investing $1 billion in U.S. plants, adding or keeping 7,000 jobs.  And it's going to be investing a lot more than that over the next fairly short period.  Lockheed Martin has -- they've just announced 1,800 new jobs, and U.S. plants are doing a great job, and we started negotiating with them a little bit on the F-35.  They cut their price a little bit.  Thank you very much.  She's tough.  (Laughter.)  But it worked out well I think for everybody.  And I think I have to say this:  Marillyn, you've gotten a lot of credit, because what you did was the right thing.  So we appreciate it.  She cut her price over $700 million, right?  By over $700 million.  You think Hillary would have asked for $700 million?  (Laughter.)  Oh, boy, I hope you -- I assume you wanted her to win.  But you know what?  You're going to do great and you're going to make more planes.  It's going to work out the same, or better.\nWalmart announced plans to create 10,000 jobs, and all of those jobs are going to be in the United States.  Sprint and SoftBank is putting in $50 billion because of our election in the United States, over the next four years, to create 50,000 jobs.  They've been terrific, by the way.  And we have many others.  Many of you are in the room, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.  We have many, many other companies.  And we're very happy.\nToday we have 24 CEOs from the largest manufacturing companies in the country and even in the world.  They represent people just in this room, nearly $1 trillion of sales and 2 million employees, large majorities of which are in the United States.  They share our commitment to bringing manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country, which has been the biggest part of my campaign.  I would say the border, a big part.  Military strength, big part.  And jobs, big part.  I don’t want to say which is most important.  I guess we always have to say defense is maybe the most important.\nBut many of you take care of our defense, you make great products.  Nobody makes the products that we do for our military.  Nobody.  And, in fact, a couple of countries who were not allowed to buy from us, I gave them -- hello, Jeff -- I gave them authorization -- you can only buy from us.  I want them to buy from us.  They were getting planes from other countries because our -- and they’re allies.  But they’re going to be buying from us from now on.\nAnd I just want to thank all of my people.  My staff has been amazing.  Gary, as you know -- you all know Gary from Goldman, Gary Cohn.  And we’re really happy -- just paid $200 million in tax in order to take this job, by the way.  (Laughter.)  Which is very much unlike Gary.  But he’s great.  And he’ll be criticized by the media because he’s getting paid $197,000.  They’ll say he really wanted that money -- which he gave up.  I think he gave up -- did you give that up, Gary?  I think so.\nMR. COHN:  Yes.\nPARTICIPANT:  It was one of those things.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was one of those things.  That’s right.  (Laughter.)\nI want to thank -- Wilbur has been so fantastic.  I’ve known Wilbur for so long, and he’s a great guy, great negotiator, but a very fair negotiator.  And he’s going to be doing things that -- the deals we have with other countries are unbelievably bad.  We don’t have any good deals.  In fact, I’m trying to find a country where we actually have a surplus of trade as opposed to -- everything is a deficit.\nWith Mexico, we have $70 billion in deficits, trade deficits, and it’s unsustainable.  We’re not going to let it happen.  Can’t let it happen.  We’re going to have a good relationship with Mexico, I hope.  And if we don’t, we don’t.  But we can’t let that happen -- $70 billion in trade deficits.  And that doesn’t include the drugs that pour across the border, like water.  So we can’t let that happen.\nWith China, we have close to a $500-billion trade deficit.  So we have to do something.  I spoke to the President, I spoke to many people.  We’re going to work on that very, very hard, and we’re going to do things that are the proper things to do.\nBut I actually said to my people:  Find a country where we actually do well.  So far, we haven’t found that country.  It’s just losses with everybody, and we’re going to turn that around.\nI want to thank Jared Kushner, who has been so involved in this, and all of my guys.   We have a great team.  We have a team of all-stars.  And we’ve been credit -- we’ve really been given credit for that.  Right now, Rex, who, as you know, he’s in Mexico -- I said, that’s going to be a tough trip, because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico.  That’s going to be a tough trip.  But he’s over there with General Kelly, who’s been unbelievable at the border.  You see what’s happening at the border.  All of a sudden for the first time we’re getting gang members out, we’re getting drug lords out.  We’re getting really bad dudes out of this country and at a rate that nobody has ever seen before.  And they’re the bad ones.\nAnd it’s a military operation because what has been allowed to come into our country -- when you see gang violence that you’ve read about like never before and all of the things -- much of that is people that are here illegally.  And they’re rough and they’re tough, but they’re not tough like our people.  So we’re getting them out.\nI thought what we could do is maybe we’ll start with Ken on my left, and we’ll go around the room and introduce yourselves to the press.  Lots of media.  One thing, we have lots of media.  How are you?  Treats me -- that’s one that treats me very nicely, one of the few.  Hi.  And we’ll just start around -- go around the room and then we’ll talk privately without the press, and we’re going to figure out how to bring many, many millions of jobs more back to the United States, okay?\nKen, go ahead.\nMR. FRAZIER:  Thank you, Mr. President, it’s good to be here.  Ken Frazier from Merck & Co., Inc.\nMR. FIELDS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mark Fields, CEO of Ford Motor Company.\nMS. MORRISON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Denise Morrison from Campbell Soup Company.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good soup.\nMS. MORRISON:  Thank you.\nMR. HAYES:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Greg Hayes from United Technologies, the parent company of Carrier.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did you bring any more of those jobs back from Carrier?  (Laughter.)  But one thing he did -- you know, I told -- I said, you were given so much credit for that, and I heard, two days ago, that you’re selling far more Carrier air conditioners than you thought, just as a patriotic move.  People are buying Carrier because of what you did -- bringing the jobs back to Indiana.\nMR. HAYES:  That’s exactly right.  It’s a great success.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right?  So, I said that.  I thought that was going to happen.  Good.  Thank you.\nMR. STYSLINGER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Lee Styslinger with Altec, Inc.\nMR. GORSKY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Alex Gorsky with Johnson & Johnson.\nMR. FARR:  Thank you, Mr. President.  David Farr with Emerson.  St. Louis.\nMR. OBERHELMAN:  Doug Oberhelman, executive chairman of Caterpillar.  We have plenty of D10s available for you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I love those D10s.  (Laughter.)  I even like the D12.  Are they still doing the D12?\nMR. OBERHELMAN:  We’re doing a D11, and we have some of those around as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because the D12, I’m waiting for, you know.  That’s going to be bigger than anything ever in history, right?  But there’s nothing like what you do.  The Caterpillars are the best.\nMR. OBERHELMAN:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And when we raise the dollar, and we let other people manipulate their currencies, it’s the one thing that stops you, Doug -- right?\nMR. OBERHELMAN:  Well, we’ll take them on.  Bring them on.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right, technology.  No, but we have to give you a level playing field.\nMR. OBERHELMAN:  We need a level playing field.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We have to let other countries give you a level playing field.  So, what a great company.  I love Caterpillar.  I’ve been driving them for a long time.\nMR. OBERHELMAN:  Well, come out and see us, and we’ll put you in one.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.  I might do that soon.  Go ahead.\nMR. KAMSICKAS:  Jim Kamsickas, Dana Incorporated. Thank you.\nMR. LONGHI:  Mario Longhi, with U.S. Steel, Mr. President.  Thank you for the opportunity.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you’re going to be doing pipelines now.  You know that, right?  We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota.  But they have to buy -- meaning, steel, so I’ll say U.S. Steel -- but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.\nMR. LONGHI:  100 percent, Mr. President.  We’ll be there.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So the pipe is coming from the U.S.\nMR. LONGHI:  By the way, when you come drive trucks, come up to Minnesota and our mines.  You’re going to see us running up there.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I’ll do it.  I’ll be out there.\nMR. FETTIG:  Mr. President, thank you.  Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yep, good.\nMS. HEWSON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin Corporation.  I just want to thank you for this opportunity that we’ve spent this morning in the working groups, and the opportunity to talk to you today about generating jobs.  We’re very excited about the fact that this is one of the first actions that you want to take on.  So thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Well, thank you, and thank you for what we did.  Lot 10, we call it.  Lot 10 -- 90 planes.  It was 90 planes out of 3,000, but it was not doing so well, and now it’s doing great.  Right?\nMS. HEWSON:  That’s right, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.\nMS. HEWSON:  And we welcome you to Fort Worth to see those aircraft on the production line.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Very good.  Thank you, Marillyn.\nMR. IMMELT:  Mr. President, good to see you again.  Jeff Immelt with GE.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Hi, Jeff.\nMR. IMMELT:  Great to be here.  Look forward to really working you on creating more manufacturing jobs.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Jeff actually watched me make a hole-in-one, can you believe that?  Should you tell that story?\nMR. IMMELT:  We were trying to talk President Trump into doing \"The Apprentice.\"  That was my assignment when we owned NBC.  President Trump goes up to a par 3 on his course, he looks to the three of us and says, “You realize of course I’m the richest golfer in the world.”  That’s a comment, then gets a hole-in-one.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Crazy.\nMR. IMMELT:  I have to say, you know, I’ve seen the magic before.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s so crazy that -- no, I actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people -- (laughter) -- to be exact.  And then I got a hole-in-one.\nMR. IMMELT:  That’s what you said.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, it was sort of cool.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nMR. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Bill Brown from Harris Corporation.  And thank you for coming to our headquarter location in Melbourne, Florida twice.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely.  Thank you.\nMR.

LEIMBACH:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Keith Leimbach, CEO of LiveOps, representing the services industry in a manufacturing form.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I know.\nMR. LEIMBACH:  Let’s remember to bring those services jobs back as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  We will.\nMR. LIVERIS:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I’m Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical.  Thank you for the opportunity, and bringing the language of business back to the White House, and I’m here to make chemistry sexy again.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I want to thank you for your help.  You’ve been great.  Thank you, Andrew, very much.\nNobody knows Ivanka.  (Laughter.)\nMR. THULIN:  Good morning, Mr. President.  Inge Thulin, 3M.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Reed, thank you also.  Thank you.  Say it again, please.\nMR.

EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Governor Greitens.  Would you give another round of applause for a great, new, dynamic governor here in Missouri inspiring people all across America with his leadership?  (Applause.)\nThank you for that kind introduction, Governor Greitens.  And congratulations on your election last year.  You're already off to the races, and President Trump and I thank you for your great leadership for the people of Missouri.  (Applause.)\nThank you all for coming out today.  It actually gets cold in Indiana in February.  (Laughter.)  But I guess it’s different here in Missouri.  I’m very honored that you all would take time in the middle of a busy week to hear a few words from me and on behalf of our great President.  And I do bring greetings on behalf of the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAnd on his behalf I’m here, and on his behalf I’m also grateful to see in the audience a number of distinguished leaders.  Your great congresswoman representing Missouri with such great distinction -- Congresswoman Ann Wagner and Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer are here.  Give them both a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  Thank you, it’s a privilege to have you here.\nI also want to thank all the small business owners who are with us today, including our host Doug Fabick and the Fabick family -- 100 years in business here in Missouri creating jobs and opportunities.  (Applause.)  Congratulations.\nI enjoyed our discussion earlier today, and I appreciate your candid feedback, Doug, and the candid feedback that we got from other business leaders and job creators all across this region.  And on that note, let me say thank you to all the great employees here at Fabick Cat for coming out today.  Hardworking men and women, you're the ones that make companies like this grow.  You are the strength in the American economy, and you're going to lead an American comeback.  (Applause.)\nAs President Trump has said so many times, it was too long that we had forgotten men and women in this country.  Well, the forgotten men and women, the men and women who carry this economy on their shoulders everyday are forgotten no more.  And on behalf of President Trump, I thank all the hardworking men and women of Fabick Cat who are here today.  Thanks for doing a great job for this country and this community.  (Applause.)\nNow, before we get started I’d like to address something that happened here in St. Louis over the weekend.  On Monday morning, America awoke to discover that nearly 200 tombstones were toppled in a nearby Jewish graveyard.\nSpeaking just yesterday, President Trump called this a “horrible and painful” act, and so it was.  That along with other recent threats to Jewish community centers around the country -- he declared it all a “sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.”\nWe condemn this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetrate it in the strongest possible terms.  (Applause.)\nAnd let me say it’s been inspiring to people all across this country to see the way the people of Missouri have rallied around the Jewish community with compassion and support.  You have inspired the nation with your kindness and your care.  (Applause.)\nIt just so happens three days ago, my wife and my daughter were overseas.  We saw firsthand what happens when hatred runs rampant in a society.  We were near Munich, Germany, where we visited the very first Nazi concentration camp ever to be constructed, a place called Dachau.\nWe were accompanied by a survivor of Dachau, a 93-year-old man named Abba Naor, who told me he had arrived there as a 17-year-old boy.  He described, as we walked through that memorial, the hellish life he endured -- toiling away as a slave while those around were taken away, one by one, never to return.\nBy the grace of God, he survived, and now he tells his story so that the world will never forget.\nBut before we left, he spoke words that touched my heart and I’ll always carry with me throughout my life, and they resonate with this moment today.  He spoke of that hellish existence in the waning days of the war, and then he looked up at me with a smile, and he said:  “Then the Americans came.”  (Applause.)\nHe spoke of the kindness of those American soldiers who liberated that camp, and he pointed a finger at me and told me when you go back, you thank every one of those soldiers for what they did for me and for my people and for my country.\nWould you join me in a round of applause for every man and woman here who has worn the uniform of a United States of America?  We are proud of you, and we are grateful to you.  (Applause.)\nThe American solider fought to end the hatred and violence against the Jewish people across Europe then, and as President Trump said yesterday, American will always, in his words, “fight bigotry, intolerance, and hatred in all its ugly forms” -- wherever it will arise.  That's the American way.  (Applause.)\nNow, thank you for letting me share that from my heart.  But let me get on to what I came here to talk to you about.  It is great to be back in Missouri.  (Applause.)\nI was here last September for a rally, and it was absolutely electric.  Two months later, the Show Me State showed America what it was made of when you helped make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America.  Thank you, Missouri.  (Applause.)\nThe President and I will always be grateful for what you did for us and what you did for this country.  America’s small businesses were actually some of our biggest supporters.  Small business owners across the land saw in this businessman who would become President someone who had the ideas and the energy and the vision to make America great again.  Hardworking Americans who make small businesses successful, folks like everyone here today, rallied behind this cause, and we brought real change to our nation’s capital.\nFabick Cat is a true American success story.  As I mentioned before, a family-owned business owned and operated since its founding back in 1917.  Today -- thanks to all of you -- Fabick Cat has 1,100 employees at 37 locations throughout the Midwest.  So many people rely on what you do.  And, frankly, Doug, what you and the family has done here for a hundred years has made Missouri great, and it’s going to be a part of making America great again.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to tell you, to all the small business owners who are here today, just know that President Trump is your biggest fan.  (Applause.)  I’ll make you a promise:  President Trump is the best friend America’s small businesses will ever have.  (Applause.)  He asked me to be here today to tell you how much he appreciates what you do for the country.\nMake no mistake about it, America finally has a President who’s going to support and fight for you every single day.  You know, both of us know that small businesses are the engine of our economy.  They’re the beating heart that creates jobs and prosperity and growth.\nI grew up in a small business and in a small town, a family-owned business in Columbus, Indiana.  I went to work at one of my dad’s gas stations when I was only 14 years or age.  I was a gas station attendant.  For those of you under 30, just imagine.  (Laughter.)  Just imagine if when you pulled into a gas station, somebody ran out with their name on their shirt, pumped your gas, washed your windows, checked you tires and didn’t charge you any more money for it.  (Laughter.)  That’s what I did for a living, and I was proud to do it, proud to be a part of a family business, proud to be a part of small-business America.\nAs the world knows, the President grew up in a family business, too.  We both, I can tell you, know the sacrifices that are required to make a family small business work -- the long hours, the hard work.  And we both know this simple fact:  When small business is strong, America is strong, and the American economy thrives.  (Applause.)\nThat’s why President Trump wants to help you become stronger than ever before.  What he said on the campaign trail about strengthening small business is what we’re already doing in the White House.  On day one, we went right to work on a plan to cut taxes for working families, small businesses and family farms.  He signed legislation to roll back reams of red tape and regulation issued under the Obama administration.  He instructed every agency and department in Washington, D.C., also to identify two regulations to get rid of before they issue another ream of red tape.  We’re rolling back taxes and we’re rolling back red tape already in Washington, D.C., thanks to you.  (Applause.)\nThe President also knows that the rule of law is the heart of a growing free-market economy and he’s taken decisive action to end illegal immigration, strengthen our borders and uphold the immigration laws of America.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m glad to say businesses are already reacting to President Trump’s “buy American and hire American” vision with optimism, investment, and a belief in our country again.  Have you noticed it?  I mean, from GM, to U.S. Steel, to IBM, to so many other companies, they’re already announcing their intention to keep jobs here, to create news ones, tens of thousands of them.  As Ford Motor Company’s chief executive put it, even before the President took his oath of office, their investments are a “vote of confidence in the agenda of President Donald Trump.”  (Applause.)\nSo let’s talk about that agenda.  Let me say, if you take nothing else from what I tell you today, know this:  The nightmare of Obamacare is about to end.  (Applause.)  Despite the best efforts of liberal activists at many town halls around the country, the American people know the truth:  Obamacare has failed, and Obamacare must go.  (Applause.)\nThis failed law is crippling the American economy and crushing the American worker.  We all know the broken promises of Obamacare; they're almost too many to count.  They told you the cost of insurance would go down.  They told you if you like your doctor, you can keep them.  They told you your health plan -- you could keep that too.  Well, none of it was true.\nAmericans are now paying $3,000 more a year for health insurance on average.  Last year alone, premiums skyrocketed by a stunning 25 percent, and millions of Americans have lost their plans and their doctors since the outset of the Affordable Care Act.  Higher cost, fewer choices, worse care -- that's Obamacare.  And that's got to end.\nSmall businesses like those represented here today know exactly what I'm talking about.  The last few years it's been harder to get ahead.  Obamacare has only made it harder still -- if not impossible in some cases.  One of the business leaders I just talked to talked about the weight of Obamacare on his nearly 700 employees, and the difficulty that it's placed on them and on their families.  Obamacare is a job-killer and everybody in America knows it.  And we're about to change all that.  We're going to repeal Obamacare once and for all.  Get rid of its mandates and its taxes and its intrusion on your lives and on your businesses.  (Applause.)\nAnd best of all, at the same time we repeal Obamacare, Obamacare is going to be replaced with something that actually works, something that brings freedom and individual responsibility back to American healthcare.  (Applause.)\nNow, President Trump and I want every American to have access to quality and affordable health insurance, which is why we're designing a better law.  A market-driven law that reforms and improves how health care is provided in this country.  We're working right now with leaders in Congress to lower the cost of health insurance by giving Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you purchase life insurance and the way you purchase car insurance.  (Applause.)\nWe're working with Congress to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions have health insurance and don't have any fear of losing that health insurance.  And we're working with Congress to give states the flexibility -- Governor Greitens, where'd you go?  We're working with Congress to make sure we give states and governors like your great governor the flexibility they need to care for the least fortunate and their healthcare needs the way it will work in Missouri and the way that will work in each individual state.  (Applause.)\nDespite the scare tactics from the liberal left, the President and I are committed -- make it clear here -- we're committed to an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America -- one that lowers the cost of health insurance, unleashes innovation, and puts the American people first.  In all those concepts -- innovation, putting people first -- those are all the same principles that got Fabick Cat to 100 years.  And it's what actually works in American business.  And we truly do believe those free-market principles -- individual responsibility and a consumer choice -- can make the best healthcare system in America married to the best health insurance system in America, as well.  (Applause.)\nIf they can work for America's business, they’ll work in American healthcare.\nBut our agenda doesn't just stop there.  I'll guarantee there isn't anyone here who can make sense of America's tax code, including me.  (Laughter.)  There's an old joke that says the tax code is about 10 times the size of the Bible but with none of the good news.  (Laughter and applause.)\nIt's a good line, but it's hardly a laughing matter.  Truth is, our country's tax system these days penalizes success.  It makes it far too hard for hardworking people and small businesses to achieve the American Dream.  It takes too much money out of your pockets.  It stifles job growth, wage growth, economic growth, and every other type of growth you need to get ahead.\nNow, rest assured, when President Trump and I get done, before we get to this summertime, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms -- and get this economy moving again.  (Applause.)\nWe want you to keep more of your hard-earned money, plain and simple.  You know how to spend your paycheck better than any politician in Washington, D.C., ever could.  By the same token, you also know how to run your businesses and your own lives better than any bureaucrat -- that's why, as I mentioned before, we're going to keep on working together, and President Trump and I are going to keep rolling back senseless regulations that are strangling businesses and stifling our country's potential.\nEveryone here knows the tremendous burden of red tape and regulation.  Complying with these monstrous costs costs time and money to businesses that would be better spent hiring more good people and growing businesses and improving worker benefits.  Our administration is working with Congress to repeal these job-killing, big-government regulations issued in the last administration in particular.  We're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded desks in Washington, D.C.  (Applause.)\nAnd before I close, if you haven't noticed it yet, let me remind you that we actually all elected a builder as the 45th President of the United States.  (Applause.)  And under President Donald Trump, we're going to rebuild America.  (Applause.)  President Trump has called attention to our nation's crumbling infrastructure like no contemporary person in public life.  Rest assured, we're going to work with the Congress to make historic investments in infrastructure so that we have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, and the best airports in the best nation on Earth.  (Applause.)\nEvery dollar we invest in infrastructure is a dollar we invest in America's future and in our prosperity.  And when we do that, let's be clear:  We're going to rebuild America, and we're going to hire American, and we're going to buy American when we rebuild this country.  (Applause.)  We're going to rebuild America with American workers and American tools.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, I'm pleased to announce President Trump has already taken action in this regard.  Some of you may have noticed, just last month, after years of senseless delays, President Trump authorized the construction of the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota pipelines for our energy future and to create American jobs.  (Applause.)  That's what it means to rebuild our infrastructure and put America back to work.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it.  Our economy is going to grow faster than ever before and faster than you can imagine.  We're already hearing from those who oppose these policies, though.  People are out there opposing tax cuts, opposing slashing outdated regulations, opposing repealing Obamacare, and most of all, they seem to want to oppose the President's effort to give power back to the American people.  We're hearing from these people every day, and the national media is more than willing to give them a platform each and every day.\nSo all I ask of all of you here in Missouri is let America hear from you.  (Applause.)\nIn the days ahead, I promise you, President Trump and I are going to work with the Congress and we're going to drive forward our best efforts to turn this country around, create good-paying jobs at home, and a safer and more prosperous America.  But America needs to hear from small business, from hardworking Americans who work in small business.  The people who know we can do better.  The people who know we can be more prosperous and know we can get this economy working for every American again.\nSo let your voice be heard.  Talk to a neighbor over a backyard fence.  Stop somebody at the grocery store.  Get online, on Facebook, send an email to a friend.  But just send them a note and say, I ran into Mike the other day -- (laughter) -- they're doing exactly what they said they were going to do, and I believe it works.  And we need to support this President and this administration.  That's what you've got to tell them.  (Applause.)\nSo thanks for coming out on this sunny day in February.  (Laughter.)  As my friend and our President likes to say, with boundless faith in the American people and faith in God who has ever watched over this land -- (applause) -- we will make America safe again.  We will make America prosperous again.  And with your help, and with God's help, and with this great new President, we will make America great again.\nLet's go get it done.  Thank you.  God bless you, Missouri.  (Applause.)\nEND\n3:08 P.M.

EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Governor Greitens.  Would you give another round of applause for a great, new, dynamic governor here in Missouri inspiring people all across America with his leadership?  (Applause.)\nThank you for that kind introduction, Governor Greitens.  And congratulations on your election last year.  You're already off to the races, and President Trump and I thank you for your great leadership for the people of Missouri.  (Applause.)\nThank you all for coming out today.  It actually gets cold in Indiana in February.  (Laughter.)  But I guess it’s different here in Missouri.  I’m very honored that you all would take time in the middle of a busy week to hear a few words from me and on behalf of our great President.  And I do bring greetings on behalf of the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAnd on his behalf I’m here, and on his behalf I’m also grateful to see in the audience a number of distinguished leaders.  Your great congresswoman representing Missouri with such great distinction -- Congresswoman Ann Wagner and Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer are here.  Give them both a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  Thank you, it’s a privilege to have you here.\nI also want to thank all the small business owners who are with us today, including our host Doug Fabick and the Fabick family -- 100 years in business here in Missouri creating jobs and opportunities.  (Applause.)  Congratulations.\nI enjoyed our discussion earlier today, and I appreciate your candid feedback, Doug, and the candid feedback that we got from other business leaders and job creators all across this region.  And on that note, let me say thank you to all the great employees here at Fabick Cat for coming out today.  Hardworking men and women, you're the ones that make companies like this grow.  You are the strength in the American economy, and you're going to lead an American comeback.  (Applause.)\nAs President Trump has said so many times, it was too long that we had forgotten men and women in this country.  Well, the forgotten men and women, the men and women who carry this economy on their shoulders everyday are forgotten no more.  And on behalf of President Trump, I thank all the hardworking men and women of Fabick Cat who are here today.  Thanks for doing a great job for this country and this community.  (Applause.)\nNow, before we get started I’d like to address something that happened here in St. Louis over the weekend.  On Monday morning, America awoke to discover that nearly 200 tombstones were toppled in a nearby Jewish graveyard.\nSpeaking just yesterday, President Trump called this a “horrible and painful” act, and so it was.  That along with other recent threats to Jewish community centers around the country -- he declared it all a “sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.”\nWe condemn this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetrate it in the strongest possible terms.  (Applause.)\nAnd let me say it’s been inspiring to people all across this country to see the way the people of Missouri have rallied around the Jewish community with compassion and support.  You have inspired the nation with your kindness and your care.  (Applause.)\nIt just so happens three days ago, my wife and my daughter were overseas.  We saw firsthand what happens when hatred runs rampant in a society.  We were near Munich, Germany, where we visited the very first Nazi concentration camp ever to be constructed, a place called Dachau.\nWe were accompanied by a survivor of Dachau, a 93-year-old man named Abba Naor, who told me he had arrived there as a 17-year-old boy.  He described, as we walked through that memorial, the hellish life he endured -- toiling away as a slave while those around were taken away, one by one, never to return.\nBy the grace of God, he survived, and now he tells his story so that the world will never forget.\nBut before we left, he spoke words that touched my heart and I’ll always carry with me throughout my life, and they resonate with this moment today.  He spoke of that hellish existence in the waning days of the war, and then he looked up at me with a smile, and he said:  “Then the Americans came.”  (Applause.)\nHe spoke of the kindness of those American soldiers who liberated that camp, and he pointed a finger at me and told me when you go back, you thank every one of those soldiers for what they did for me and for my people and for my country.\nWould you join me in a round of applause for every man and woman here who has worn the uniform of a United States of America?  We are proud of you, and we are grateful to you.  (Applause.)\nThe American solider fought to end the hatred and violence against the Jewish people across Europe then, and as President Trump said yesterday, American will always, in his words, “fight bigotry, intolerance, and hatred in all its ugly forms” -- wherever it will arise.  That's the American way.  (Applause.)\nNow, thank you for letting me share that from my heart.  But let me get on to what I came here to talk to you about.  It is great to be back in Missouri.  (Applause.)\nI was here last September for a rally, and it was absolutely electric.  Two months later, the Show Me State showed America what it was made of when you helped make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America.  Thank you, Missouri.  (Applause.)\nThe President and I will always be grateful for what you did for us and what you did for this country.  America’s small businesses were actually some of our biggest supporters.  Small business owners across the land saw in this businessman who would become President someone who had the ideas and the energy and the vision to make America great again.  Hardworking Americans who make small businesses successful, folks like everyone here today, rallied behind this cause, and we brought real change to our nation’s capital.\nFabick Cat is a true American success story.  As I mentioned before, a family-owned business owned and operated since its founding back in 1917.  Today -- thanks to all of you -- Fabick Cat has 1,100 employees at 37 locations throughout the Midwest.  So many people rely on what you do.  And, frankly, Doug, what you and the family has done here for a hundred years has made Missouri great, and it’s going to be a part of making America great again.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to tell you, to all the small business owners who are here today, just know that President Trump is your biggest fan.  (Applause.)  I’ll make you a promise:  President Trump is the best friend America’s small businesses will ever have.  (Applause.)  He asked me to be here today to tell you how much he appreciates what you do for the country.\nMake no mistake about it, America finally has a President who’s going to support and fight for you every single day.  You know, both of us know that small businesses are the engine of our economy.  They’re the beating heart that creates jobs and prosperity and growth.\nI grew up in a small business and in a small town, a family-owned business in Columbus, Indiana.  I went to work at one of my dad’s gas stations when I was only 14 years or age.  I was a gas station attendant.  For those of you under 30, just imagine.  (Laughter.)  Just imagine if when you pulled into a gas station, somebody ran out with their name on their shirt, pumped your gas, washed your windows, checked you tires and didn’t charge you any more money for it.  (Laughter.)  That’s what I did for a living, and I was proud to do it, proud to be a part of a family business, proud to be a part of small-business America.\nAs the world knows, the President grew up in a family business, too.  We both, I can tell you, know the sacrifices that are required to make a family small business work -- the long hours, the hard work.  And we both know this simple fact:  When small business is strong, America is strong, and the American economy thrives.  (Applause.)\nThat’s why President Trump wants to help you become stronger than ever before.  What he said on the campaign trail about strengthening small business is what we’re already doing in the White House.  On day one, we went right to work on a plan to cut taxes for working families, small businesses and family farms.  He signed legislation to roll back reams of red tape and regulation issued under the Obama administration.  He instructed every agency and department in Washington, D.C., also to identify two regulations to get rid of before they issue another ream of red tape.  We’re rolling back taxes and we’re rolling back red tape already in Washington, D.C., thanks to you.  (Applause.)\nThe President also knows that the rule of law is the heart of a growing free-market economy and he’s taken decisive action to end illegal immigration, strengthen our borders and uphold the immigration laws of America.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m glad to say businesses are already reacting to President Trump’s “buy American and hire American” vision with optimism, investment, and a belief in our country again.  Have you noticed it?  I mean, from GM, to U.S. Steel, to IBM, to so many other companies, they’re already announcing their intention to keep jobs here, to create news ones, tens of thousands of them.  As Ford Motor Company’s chief executive put it, even before the President took his oath of office, their investments are a “vote of confidence in the agenda of President Donald Trump.”  (Applause.)\nSo let’s talk about that agenda.  Let me say, if you take nothing else from what I tell you today, know this:  The nightmare of Obamacare is about to end.  (Applause.)  Despite the best efforts of liberal activists at many town halls around the country, the American people know the truth:  Obamacare has failed, and Obamacare must go.  (Applause.)\nThis failed law is crippling the American economy and crushing the American worker.  We all know the broken promises of Obamacare; they're almost too many to count.  They told you the cost of insurance would go down.  They told you if you like your doctor, you can keep them.  They told you your health plan -- you could keep that too.  Well, none of it was true.\nAmericans are now paying $3,000 more a year for health insurance on average.  Last year alone, premiums skyrocketed by a stunning 25 percent, and millions of Americans have lost their plans and their doctors since the outset of the Affordable Care Act.  Higher cost, fewer choices, worse care -- that's Obamacare.  And that's got to end.\nSmall businesses like those represented here today know exactly what I'm talking about.  The last few years it's been harder to get ahead.  Obamacare has only made it harder still -- if not impossible in some cases.  One of the business leaders I just talked to talked about the weight of Obamacare on his nearly 700 employees, and the difficulty that it's placed on them and on their families.  Obamacare is a job-killer and everybody in America knows it.  And we're about to change all that.  We're going to repeal Obamacare once and for all.  Get rid of its mandates and its taxes and its intrusion on your lives and on your businesses.  (Applause.)\nAnd best of all, at the same time we repeal Obamacare, Obamacare is going to be replaced with something that actually works, something that brings freedom and individual responsibility back to American healthcare.  (Applause.)\nNow, President Trump and I want every American to have access to quality and affordable health insurance, which is why we're designing a better law.  A market-driven law that reforms and improves how health care is provided in this country.  We're working right now with leaders in Congress to lower the cost of health insurance by giving Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you purchase life insurance and the way you purchase car insurance.  (Applause.)\nWe're working with Congress to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions have health insurance and don't have any fear of losing that health insurance.  And we're working with Congress to give states the flexibility -- Governor Greitens, where'd you go?  We're working with Congress to make sure we give states and governors like your great governor the flexibility they need to care for the least fortunate and their healthcare needs the way it will work in Missouri and the way that will work in each individual state.  (Applause.)\nDespite the scare tactics from the liberal left, the President and I are committed -- make it clear here -- we're committed to an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America -- one that lowers the cost of health insurance, unleashes innovation, and puts the American people first.  In all those concepts -- innovation, putting people first -- those are all the same principles that got Fabick Cat to 100 years.  And it's what actually works in American business.  And we truly do believe those free-market principles -- individual responsibility and a consumer choice -- can make the best healthcare system in America married to the best health insurance system in America, as well.  (Applause.)\nIf they can work for America's business, they’ll work in American healthcare.\nBut our agenda doesn't just stop there.  I'll guarantee there isn't anyone here who can make sense of America's tax code, including me.  (Laughter.)  There's an old joke that says the tax code is about 10 times the size of the Bible but with none of the good news.  (Laughter and applause.)\nIt's a good line, but it's hardly a laughing matter.  Truth is, our country's tax system these days penalizes success.  It makes it far too hard for hardworking people and small businesses to achieve the American Dream.  It takes too much money out of your pockets.  It stifles job growth, wage growth, economic growth, and every other type of growth you need to get ahead.\nNow, rest assured, when President Trump and I get done, before we get to this summertime, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms -- and get this economy moving again.  (Applause.)\nWe want you to keep more of your hard-earned money, plain and simple.  You know how to spend your paycheck better than any politician in Washington, D.C., ever could.  By the same token, you also know how to run your businesses and your own lives better than any bureaucrat -- that's why, as I mentioned before, we're going to keep on working together, and President Trump and I are going to keep rolling back senseless regulations that are strangling businesses and stifling our country's potential.\nEveryone here knows the tremendous burden of red tape and regulation.  Complying with these monstrous costs costs time and money to businesses that would be better spent hiring more good people and growing businesses and improving worker benefits.  Our administration is working with Congress to repeal these job-killing, big-government regulations issued in the last administration in particular.  We're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded desks in Washington, D.C.  (Applause.)\nAnd before I close, if you haven't noticed it yet, let me remind you that we actually all elected a builder as the 45th President of the United States.  (Applause.)  And under President Donald Trump, we're going to rebuild America.  (Applause.)  President Trump has called attention to our nation's crumbling infrastructure like no contemporary person in public life.  Rest assured, we're going to work with the Congress to make historic investments in infrastructure so that we have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, and the best airports in the best nation on Earth.  (Applause.)\nEvery dollar we invest in infrastructure is a dollar we invest in America's future and in our prosperity.  And when we do that, let's be clear:  We're going to rebuild America, and we're going to hire American, and we're going to buy American when we rebuild this country.  (Applause.)  We're going to rebuild America with American workers and American tools.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, I'm pleased to announce President Trump has already taken action in this regard.  Some of you may have noticed, just last month, after years of senseless delays, President Trump authorized the construction of the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota pipelines for our energy future and to create American jobs.  (Applause.)  That's what it means to rebuild our infrastructure and put America back to work.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it.  Our economy is going to grow faster than ever before and faster than you can imagine.  We're already hearing from those who oppose these policies, though.  People are out there opposing tax cuts, opposing slashing outdated regulations, opposing repealing Obamacare, and most of all, they seem to want to oppose the President's effort to give power back to the American people.  We're hearing from these people every day, and the national media is more than willing to give them a platform each and every day.\nSo all I ask of all of you here in Missouri is let America hear from you.  (Applause.)\nIn the days ahead, I promise you, President Trump and I are going to work with the Congress and we're going to drive forward our best efforts to turn this country around, create good-paying jobs at home, and a safer and more prosperous America.  But America needs to hear from small business, from hardworking Americans who work in small business.  The people who know we can do better.  The people who know we can be more prosperous and know we can get this economy working for every American again.\nSo let your voice be heard.  Talk to a neighbor over a backyard fence.  Stop somebody at the grocery store.  Get online, on Facebook, send an email to a friend.  But just send them a note and say, I ran into Mike the other day -- (laughter) -- they're doing exactly what they said they were going to do, and I believe it works.  And we need to support this President and this administration.  That's what you've got to tell them.  (Applause.)\nSo thanks for coming out on this sunny day in February.  (Laughter.)  As my friend and our President likes to say, with boundless faith in the American people and faith in God who has ever watched over this land -- (applause) -- we will make America safe again.  We will make America prosperous again.  And with your help, and with God's help, and with this great new President, we will make America great again.\nLet's go get it done.  Thank you.  God bless you, Missouri.  (Applause.)\nEND\n3:08 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all.  This will be somewhat of an informal meeting.  I want to congratulate Mick Mulvaney, who’s been confirmed finally -- we waited a long time -- by the Senate.  And he’s going to be an absolutely great director.  Total confidence in Mick.  Known him for a long time.  He loves those budgets.\nUnfortunately, the budget we’re inheriting -- essentially inheriting -- is a mess.  The finances of our country are a mess.  But we’re going to clean them up.  Things that we’ve been doing, including negotiating deals that have already been negotiated, so you call it re-negotiating -- on airplanes and lots of other things, military items -- we’ll end up either getting many more planes free, or we’re going to save a lot of money.  But we’ve already saved a lot; billions and billions of dollars have been saved.\nWe have enormous work to do as the national debt doubled over the last eight years.  Our debt has doubled over a short period of time.  I want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities.  We’ll be directing all of our departments and agencies to protect every last American and every last tax dollar.  No more wasted money.\nWe’re going to be spending the money in a very, very careful manner.  Our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable.  We must do a lot more with less.  And we must stop the improper payments and the abuses, negotiate better prices, and look for every last dollar of savings.\nWe’ve already imposed hiring freezes on nonessential government workers, and part of our commitment is to continue to do that for the American taxpayer.  We have appointed a Cabinet that knows how to manage dollars wisely.  I’ve known many of the folks for a long time.  They’ve been tremendous winners -- whether it’s Steve or Gary or another Steve, right here.  And that’s why I will direct them to manage the country’s dollars and your dollars very wisely.  We won’t let your money be wasted anymore.  We’re going to run government smoothly, efficiently, and on behalf of the very hardworking taxpayers -- something that the taxpayers haven’t seen in a long time.  I will be holding everybody accountable for that, and I have no doubt that this group -- in particular, this group will do a fantastic job.\nI want to congratulate Steve Mnuchin as our new Secretary of the Treasury.  He’s going to be outstanding.  Tremendous track record -- he has a tremendous track record.  I have great confidence in him.\nSo we’re going to continue on, and we’re going to take this budget, which is -- in all fairness, I’ve only been here for four weeks, so I can’t take too much of the blame for what’s happened.  But it is absolutely out of control, and we’re going to do things that are going to be tremendous over the years.  We have to take care of our military.  We have no choice, we have to take care of our military.  It needs work; it’s very depleted.  And we have to take care of a lot of other things.\nHealthcare is moving along nicely.  It’s being put into final forms.  As you know, before we do the tax -- which is actually very well finalized -- but we can’t submit it until the healthcare, statutorily or otherwise.  So we’re doing the healthcare.  Again, moving along very well.  Sometime during the month of March, maybe mid- to early March we will be submitting something that I think people will be very impressed by.\nAnd with that, we’re going to have a little meeting.  And I think the press knows pretty much all of the people at the table, so thank you very much.  We appreciate it.\nEND\n12:43 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  It's a great honor to be here.  This was some beautiful morning and what a job they've done, like few others have been able to do.\nI am very, very proud of Lonnie Bunch.  The work and the love that he has in his heart for what he's done is -- I always talk about you need enthusiasm, you need really love for anything you do to do it successfully.  And, Lonnie, you are where?  Come on.  Where's Lonnie?  You should be up here, Lonnie.  Come on.\nAnd David -- we have to get David up here, too.  David Skorton is tremendous and he was singing Lonnie's praises all morning long.  So you two should at least be here.  So we appreciate it very much.\nAnd David Rubenstein, who is here someplace, he is -- come on, David, you have to get up here, David.  You certainly deserve it.  He's a very, very successful guy who spends money doing great things, and he's been a great help to so many different groups and this one in particular.\nThank you.  It's a privilege to be here today.  This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes -- heroes like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro students, and the African American Medal of Honor recipients, among so many other really incredible heroes.\nIt's amazing to see.  I went to -- we did a pretty comprehensive tour, but not comprehensive enough.  So, Lonnie, I'll be back.  I told you that.  Because I could stay here for a lot longer, believe me.  It's really incredible.\nI'm deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit.  My wife was here last week and took a tour, and it was something that she's still talking about.  Ivanka is here right now.  Hi, Ivanka.  And it really is very, very special.  It's something that, frankly, if you want to know the truth, it's doing so well that everybody is talking about it.\nI know President Obama was here for the museum's opening last fall.  And I'm honored to be the second sitting President to visit this great museum.  Etched in the hall that we passed today is a quote from Spottswood Rice, a runaway slave who joined the Union Army.  He believed that his fellow African Americans always looked to the United States as the promised land of universal freedom.  Today and every day of my presidency, I pledge to do everything I can to continue that promise of freedom for African Americans and for every American.  So important.  Nothing more important.\nThis tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.  The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.\nI want to thank a great friend of mine, Dr. Ben Carson, and his beautiful family -- Candy and the whole family -- for joining us today.  It was very special to accompany him and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit.  First time.  I’m so proud of you.  I love this guy.  He’s a great guy.  Really a great guy.  And he can tell you better than me, but I’ll tell you what, we really started something with Ben.  We’re very, very proud of him.  Hopefully, next week he’ll get his approval, about three or four weeks late -- and you’re doing better than most, right?  But the Democrats, they’ll come along.  I have no doubt they’ll come along.  But Ben is going to do a fantastic job at HUD.  I have absolutely no doubt he will be one of the great -- ever -- in that position.\nHe grew up in Detroit, and had very little.  He defied every statistic.  He graduated from Yale, and he went on to University of Michigan’s medical school.  He became a brilliant -- totally brilliant -- neurosurgeon, saved many lives, and helped many, many people.  We’re going to do great things in our African American communities together.  Ben is going to work with me very, very closely.  And HUD has a meaning far beyond housing.  If properly done, it’s a meaning that’s as big as anything there is, and Ben will be able to find that true meaning and the true meaning of HUD as its Secretary.  So I just look forward to that.  I look forward to watching that.  He’ll do things that nobody ever thought of.\nI also want to thank Senator Tim Scott for joining us today.  Friend of mine -- a great, great senator from South Carolina.  I like the state of South Carolina.  I like all those states where I won by double, double, double digits.  You know, those states.  But South Carolina was one, and Tim has been fantastic how he represents the people.  And they love him.\nI also want to profoundly thank Alveda King for being here, and as we saw her uncle’s wonderful exhibit, and he certainly deserves that.  Mrs. King -- and by the way, Ms. King, I can tell you this personally because I watch her all the time, and she is a tremendous fighter for justice.  And so, Alveda, thank you very much.\nMS. KING:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Come up here for a second.\nMS. KING:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have been watching you for so long, and you are so incredible.  And I wanted to thank you for all the nice things you say about me.\nMS. KING:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not everybody says nice things, but she’s special.\nMS. KING:  I love you and your family.  You’re the best.  You’re great.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Come here.\nMS. KING:  Thank you.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, darling.  Appreciate it.\nSo with that, we’re going to just end this incredible beginning of a morning.  But engraved in the wall very nearby, a quote by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.  In 1955, he told the world, “We are determined…to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”\nAnd that’s what it’s going to be.  We’re going to bring this country together, maybe bring some of the world together, but we’re going to bring this country together.  We have a divided country.  It’s been divided for many, many years, but we’re going to bring it together.  I hope every day of my presidency we will be honoring the determination and work towards a very worthy goal.\nAnd for Lonnie, and David, and David, and Ben, and Alveda, and everybody, I just want to -- I just have to say that what they’ve done here is something that can probably not be duplicated.  It was done with love and lots of money, right Lonnie?  (Laughter.)  Lots of money.  We can’t avoid that.  But it was done with tremendous love and passion, and that’s why it’s so great.\nSo thank you all very much for being here, I appreciate it.  And congratulations.  This is a truly great museum.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n10:03 A.M.

too many new and sometimes surprising opinions have been voiced over -- in this time about our relations and our common security for us to pretend that everything is as it used to be.\nAnd thank you for being so open and frank with me, Mr. Vice President.  Today I heard words which are promising for the future, words which explain a lot about the approach of the new administration in Washington.\nI repaid our guest by offering honesty in my assessment of the situation.  I shared our concerns and hopes.  Given that I am an incurably pro-American European who is fanatically devoted to transatlantic cooperation, I could afford to be outspoken even more.\nI asked the Vice President directly if he shared my opinions on three key matters:  international order, security, and the attitude of the new American administration towards the European Union.\nFirstly, I expressed my belief that maintaining order based on the rules of international law where brute force and egoism do not determine everything lies in the interest of the West; and that maintaining that order can only be enforced through a common, mutually supportive and decisive policy of the whole of the Western community.  And for millions of people around the world, the predictability and stability of our approach provides the guarantee of, at the very least, hope that chaos, violence, and arrogance will not triumph in the global dimension.\nReferring to some statements made in Munich just two days ago, I would like to say clearly that the reports of the death of the West have been greatly exaggerated.  Whoever wants to demolish that order, anticipating a post-West order must know that in its defense we remain determined.\nSecondly, our security is based on NATO and the closest possible transatlantic cooperation.  We must work together to modernize the forms of this cooperation.  Some of them should, indeed, be improved.  But we should also, I believe, agree on one thing:  The idea of NATO is not obsolete, just like the values, which lay at its foundation are not obsolete.\nLet us discuss everything, starting with financial commitment -- but only to strengthen our solidarity, never to weaken it.\nThirdly, we are counting, as always, on the past; on the United States’ whole-hearted and unequivocal -- let me repeat unequivocal -- support for the idea of a united Europe.  The world would be a decidedly worst place if Europe were not united.\nAmericans know best what great value it is to be united, and that becoming divided is the prelude to a fall.  It is in the interest of us all to prevent the disintegration of the West.\nAnd as for our continent, in this respect, we will not invent anything better than the European Union.\nIn reply to these three methods, I heard today from Vice President Pence three times, yes.  After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.\nOn Saturday in Munich, you mentioned that during your trip across Europe in 1977 with your older brother, you found yourselves at some point in West Berlin, marveling at what you saw; then crossing through Checkpoint Charlie only to see the shadow of repression hanging over people.  If you know, I had been living under this shadow for over 30 years.  What I vividly remember from my own past is how after martial law was imposed in Poland on December 13, 1981, President Ronald Reagan urged all Americans to light a solidarity candle on Christmas Eve, as he did himself.\nIt is not difficult to imagine how this moving message of American solidarity with the oppressed Polish nation against, as Reagan said, the forces of tyranny and those who incite them from without, helped bring back hope and the determination not to give in.\nIn your speech, you also highlighted the historic role of some American and European leaders including Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa.  I was lucky to cooperate closely with the two of them in difficult times.  Similarly to us, they all believed in the purpose of cooperation and solidarity between Europe and the U.S.  We cannot let their efforts go to waste.\nAfter today’s talks, it will be easier for me to believe that we will fulfill this task.\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Thank you, President Tusk.  Thank you for your warm hospitality today.\nAnd thank you for those eloquent words and your personal courage and leadership.  It’s an honor to meet you and on behalf of the President of the United States to bring greetings.  And I may make a note never to follow you at a podium again.  (Laughter.)  So thank you again for your eloquence.\nLast night I was honored to have dinner with the Prime Minister of Belgium.  This morning I met with the European Union’s High Representative Mogherini.  And this morning, a very constructive and productive conversation with President Tusk, and it’s an honor to be here.\nThis afternoon, I will meet with President Juncker of the European Commission before taking meetings at NATO at returning to Washington, D.C.\nSaturday, as President Tusk said, I was pleased to address the Munich Security Council to speak about the importance of the strategic alliance the United States entered upon so many years ago in the North American Treaty Organization.\nBut the President did ask me to come here to Brussels, to the home of the European Union, and deliver an additional message.  And so today it is my privilege on behalf of President Trump to express the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union.\nWhatever our differences, our two continents share the same heritage, the same values, and above all, the same purpose:  to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.  And to those objectives we will remain committed.\nThis has been the European Union’s goal since before its formal founding in 1993.  What began as a modest Western European trade agreement in 1951 has grown into a commitment to the four freedoms:  freedom of movement -- goods, capital, services, and people; a common currency; and a common approach to foreign and security policy.\nAnd what began 60 years ago with the Treaty of Rome among six Western European nations has grown to encompass north and south, east and west; and you welcomed new states after the end of the Cold War.\nWith this union and in cooperation with the United States, history will attest that when the United States and Europe are peaceful and prosperous, we do advance the peace and prosperity of all the world.\nOur economies are the world’s largest -- accounting for half of the world’s economic output.  Transatlantic commerce supports 14 million jobs on both continents and improves the lives and well-being of all of our citizens.\nAnd so today we reaffirm our commitment to free, fair, and flourishing economies that undergird our success, and to cooperation in achieving that.\nMaintaining and strengthening our economic vitality will require hard but necessary choices.  Renewed growth means improved peace and prosperity for all.  We must be strong, and we must be united, as well, in our efforts to confront threats to Europe’s security and stability.\nIt’s heartbreaking to reflect that now nearly a year ago, here in Brussels, in the heart of the European Union, three horrific suicide bombings and attacks took place, killing 33 innocent victims, including four Americans, injuring hundreds more.\nLet me say to this community, the European community, your losses at the hands of barbaric terrorists are felt equally in every household and every heart in America.  And you have our condolences and our determination to continue to do all that we can in partnership with the European Union and with all of our allies in Europe to ensure that such attacks never happen again.\nWe seek to take measures, and we call upon the European community to join with the United States in continuing to intensify our efforts to counter the threat of radical Islamic terrorism here on the continent.\nNow, this will require greater coordination and intelligence sharing among EU member states and between the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  And let me assure you, the United States is committed to continuing and expanding our collaboration on the collective security of all of our peoples.\nThe safety and security of your union and our people depends on that increased collaboration in the global fight against terrorism.  And the United States will remain a full partner with the EU and with all of our European allies to accomplish that.\nIn addition to confronting terrorism together, clearly we must stand strong in defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations in Europe.  In the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force, we will continue to support efforts in Poland and the Baltic States through NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence Initiative.\nAnd with regard to Ukraine, the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable and demand that Russia honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning by de-escalating the violence in eastern Ukraine.\nWe urge both sides -- we urge both sides -- to abide by the cease-fire that was scheduled to begin today.  And in the interest of peace and in the interest of innocent human lives, we hope and pray that this cease-fire takes hold.\nWhile the United States will continue to hold to hold Russia accountable, at President Trump’s direction, we will also search in new ways for new common ground with Russia, which President Trump believes can be found.\nThe United States’ commitment to the European Union is steadfast and enduring.\nPresident Tusk, President Trump and I look forward to working together with you and the European Union to deepen our political and economic partnership.  We are separated by an ocean, but we are joined by a common heritage and by a common commitment to freedom, to democracy, and to the rule of law.  And we're confident that that bond will endure and grow in the years ahead as we meet our future together.\nThank you again for your hospitality, Mr. President.  And thank you all.\nEND", "timestamp": "2017-02-20T00:00:00", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President and European Council President Tusk"}

CET\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  (In progress) took office, and just a few days after your great speech in Munich where you so clearly declared the strong commitment and the unwavering support of the United States to the transatlantic bond.\nAnd we welcome that because we see the strong commitment of the United States to the transatlantic bond, not only in words but also in deeds.  These days the United States is deploying new forces -- additional forces -- to Europe, which is of great importance for the security of Europe and which demonstrates the strong transatlantic commitment of the United States.  And we are very grateful for this commitment.\nYou also stressed that just as the U.S. stood with Europe, Europe stood tall with the United States.  And we have to remember that the only time that the alliance has involved our collective defense clause, Article 5, was after an attack on the United States.  And this was more than just a gesture.  Several hundred thousands of Canadian and European troops have served in Afghanistan, and more than a thousand have paid the ultimate price.\nThe bond between the United States and NATO -- between the United States and Europe embodied in the NATO alliance is very important today because we live in times of turmoil and instability, and then we need a strong alliance more than ever.  And we are stronger when we stand together.\nDuring our meeting, we discussed our progress in the fight against terrorism.  NATO continues to train security forces in Afghanistan.  We have started to train security forces and officers in Iraq.  And we support the U.S.-led coalition against ISIL   with AWACS surveillance planes.\nBut we agree that the alliance can and should do more in the fight against terrorism.  We also agree on the importance of higher defense spending and fairer burden sharing in NATO.  This is has been my top priority since I took office.  Europeans cannot ask the United States to commit to Europe’s defense if they are not willing to commit more themselves.\nAnd they are committing more.  In 2016, after many years of cuts, we turned a corner.  Defense spending increased across Europe and Canada by 3.8 percent in real terms, or U.S. $10 billion.  But we still have a long way to go, so all allies must speed up their efforts to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense.\nThis will be an important point when allied leaders meet here in Brussels in May.  So, Mr. Vice President, thank you for our excellent discussion.  We agree that NATO is the most successful alliance in history because NATO has been able to adapt and change when the world is changing.  And we agree that we must continue to change to keep our people safe.  U.S. leadership remains indispensable.  So I really look forward to working with you and to welcoming President Trump in Brussels in May.\nSo please, you have the floor.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary General.\nIt is a privilege to meet with you today to bring greetings on behalf of President Donald Trump and also to have the opportunity for a thorough and substantive discussion of the issues facing NATO and our historic alliance.\nIt has been a busy weekend for me.  As I prepare to head back to the United States, I’m grateful.  I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to speak on Saturday about our shared security issues at the Munich Security Conference.  And I appreciate your encouraging words about the message of the United States at that conference.\nAnd I also was pleased to be able to hold a series of productive bilateral meetings with leaders from all across the world.\nIt was also deeply moving for me and my family to return to Dachau, the very first concentration camp, and to be accompanied by a survivor by the name of Abba Naor.  I had first visited that camp in 1977.  I wanted my daughter to see it.  And we went there and walked through that historic memorial.\nAbba told me that he arrived at Dachau as a 17-year-old boy.  He told me of the nightmarish existence that he experienced there.  But then he spoke words that resonate with our alliance.  He said:  “Then the Americans came.”\nThose words touched my heart, and they speak volumes about the history and importance of the North Atlantic alliance and of NATO, more of which I’ll address momentarily.\nBut I thank you again for your hospitality in this historic place at this important time.\nI was also grateful today to meet with the leadership of the European Union.  And on behalf of President Trump, I express the commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the EU.\nWhile we have our differences on some issues, I reiterated this point in all of my meetings with the EU leadership and appreciated the cordial and substantive discussions that we had.\nBut on Saturday, as the Secretary General mentioned, at the Munich Security Conference, I brought a message from President Trump -- the message is the same one I bring to you today.\nIt is my privilege here at the NATO Headquarters to express the strong support of President Trump and the United States of America for NATO and our transatlantic alliance.\nThe United States has been a proud and faithful member of NATO since its founding in 1949.  This alliance plays a crucial role in promoting peace and prosperity in the North Atlantic and, frankly, in the entire world.\nThe United States’ commitment to NATO is clear.  As we speak, President Trump and our administration are developing plans to ensure that the strongest military in the world in the United States becomes stronger still.\nLet me assure you, Mr. Secretary, that in the United States, we're about the process of strengthening our military and restoring the arsenal of democracy.  Working with members of Congress, we intend to increase military funding to make it possible for us to provide for the common defense for the people of the United States, but also meet the obligations that we have with our treaty allies, including in this historic treaty.\nAmerica -- therefore I can say with confidence:  America will do our part.  But Europe’s defense requires Europe’s commitment as much as ours.\nAt the Wales Summit in 2014, all 28 members of the NATO alliance declared their intention to move towards a minimum security investment of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade.\nAs a candidate for office, President Trump actually called attention repeatedly to the fact that for too long, for too many, this burden has not been shared fairly among our NATO allies.  And that must come to an end.\nAt this moment, the United States and only four other NATO members meet this basic standard.  And while we commend the few nations that are on track and have met the obligation, the truth is that many others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a clear and credible path to meet this minimum goal.\nSo let me say again what I said this last weekend in Munich, the President of the United States and the American people expect our allies to keep their word and to do more in our common defense.  And the President expects real progress by the end of 2017.\nAs Secretary of Defense James Mattis said here in Belgium just a few short days ago, if you’re a nation that meets the 2 percent target, we need your help encouraging other nations to do likewise.  If you have a plan to get there, as he said, our alliance needs you to accelerate it.  And if you don’t yet have a plan, these are my words not his:  Get one.  It is time for actions, not words.\nAnd let me thank specifically the Secretary General for your outspoken leadership on this issue.  As you and I discussed privately and you've discussed with the President, the world needs NATO’s strength and leadership now more than ever before.  And we are grateful, Mr. Secretary General, that you join us in calling for immediate and steady progress on all of our NATO allies’ commitment to our common defense.\nThe truth is the rise of adversaries new and old demands a strong response from this alliance.  In the east, NATO has embarked on improvement in its deterrent posture by stationing four combat-ready multinational battalions in Poland and the Baltic States.\nAnd as I assured the Secretary General in our meeting today, in the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force, the United States will continue its leadership role in the Enhanced Forward Presence Initiative and other critical joint actions.\nWith regard to Ukraine, as I said before, our alliance will continue to hold Russia accountable and demand that they honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning with de-escalating violence in eastern Ukraine.\nFor the sake of peace and for the sake of innocent human lives, we urge both sides to abide by the ceasefire that began today.  And we pray for peace in Ukraine.\nBe assured, the United States, as well, will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which President Trump firmly believes can be found.\nAs I said in Munich, though, NATO’s continued leadership is also necessary in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism; this, another item that as a candidate for office, President Trump first raised.\nAs a candidate a year ago, he called on NATO to evolve by expanding counterterrorism operations.  And we're encouraged to see under your leadership NATO is in the process of doing just that.  It’s hard to speak of these issues in the abstract as I stand here in Brussels, just now almost a year ago that three horrific suicide bombings occurred, 33 innocent victims, including four Americans, hundreds more injured.  I just want to assure the people of Brussels and all the people of Europe that your pain is our pain, your loss our loss.  And it’s precisely why the President believes it’s essential that NATO continue on this new path of evolving and expanding its mission to be more effective in counterterrorism.\nWe will work tirelessly with our NATO allies to ensure security in our countries and yours.  But adapting to these new and ever-shifting challenges must remain a central focus of our collaboration and cooperation.  Our alliance needs to intensify efforts to cut off terrorist funding and increase cyber capabilities.  We must be -- as I said before, we must be as dominant in the digital world as we are in the physical world.  And the United States is committed to continuing to work with our NATO allies to achieve that objective for the security of all the nations in our alliance.\nBy building on tactics from the last century with these new century opportunities and challenges, NATO will be better prepared to confront and overcome the new adversaries of the 21st century.\nUnder President Trump’s leadership, the United States, I can assure you, is fully committed to NATO’s noble mission.  We are grateful for your leadership, Mr. Secretary General.  And I know the President looks forward to working closely with you to advance our shared objectives.  A strong NATO means a safer world.  And the United States of America looks forward to continuing to work with our partners in NATO to achieve just that.\nSo, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your hospitality and for your leadership.\nQ    Vice President, you've given your assurances today here in Brussels to European leaders that the U.S. is committed to working with Europe.  President Trump has said very different things.  He’s said that the EU is a vehicle for Germany, that the U.K. was smart to get out, and he expected other countries to follow.  Who should European leaders listen to -- you or President Trump?  Can they be certain that what you say, the assurances you give, won’t be contradicted in a tweet or a statement at a press conference tomorrow?\nAnd, Secretary General, who do you listen to?  And are you concerned about differences in what you hear?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, thank you for the question.  Let me say it’s my great privilege to serve as Vice President for the 45th President of the United States.  And the President directed me to go to Munich and to come here to Brussels with a very specific message:  To go to Munich to the Munich Security Conference and make it very clear, as I do so again today here at NATO’s Headquarters, that the United States is expressing strong support for NATO, even as we challenge NATO and challenge our allies to evolve to the new and widening challenges and further meet their responsibilities in this ever-changing, ever-complicated world of threats.\nBut with regard to the EU, the President also directed me to come here to Brussels.  And I had the great privilege of meeting with leaders of the Europe Union throughout the morning, and to express the desire of the United States to continue cooperation and partnership with the European Union.\nWe respect the determination of the people of Great Britain, as manifested in Brexit.  And we respect the judgement of the peoples of Europe in the European Union.  And as I said today through many leaders, we look forward to working across the Channel with all parties in the years ahead on behalf of peace and prosperity.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  I have heard exactly the same firm message from the President of the United States in two phone calls; from the Vice President in meetings today and in Munich; and from Secretary Mattis -- Tillerson, and Kelly.  They all conveyed the same message that the United States is firmly committed to the transatlantic partnership and have an unwavering support for the NATO alliance.\nAnd I welcome that very much -- both the very clear statements from all leaders in the new administration, but also the fact that this is not only something we see in words, but we also see it in deeds.\nFor the first time in many years, we see an increase of U.S. military presence in Europe.  And we are deploying new battle groups.  The U.S. is deploying a new brigade.  And we see on the ground more U.S. presence in Europe.  So this is a commitment in words, but also in deeds.\nWhen it comes to the European Union, I would like to underline the importance of the enhanced cooperation between NATO and the European Union.  We have actually been able to bring that to a new level, implementing many different issues -- or measures.  And we signed the joint declaration between President Tusk, President Juncker, and me in Warsaw and are now following up on implementing that.\nWe are working closer on hybrid, on cyber, on addressing how to build the capacity in our neighborhood, and how to stabilize our neighborhood, our areas where we work together with the European Union.  And I think, actually, the NATO-EU cooperation is even more important now because we live in times with turmoil and unpredictability, and then we need a strong cooperation between NATO and the European Union, and I welcome the very strong U.S. support for that approach.\nQ    Thank you.  Mr. Vice President, I wanted to ask you about the dismissal of General Flynn recently.  Did you feel like you were misled by members of the Trump administration?  Or were you frustrated that you were left out of the loop on this situation?  And what assurances have you received from President Trump that something like this will not happen again?\nAnd for Mr. Secretary General, both you and the Trump administration have talked about the need for additional funding for defense.  What are the consequences for inaction by NATO members?  Is there any scenario in which the Article V commitments might be considered conditional if NATO members do not fulfill their defense spending obligations?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Thank you, Ken.  Let me say, I am very grateful for the close working relationship I have with the President of the United States.  I would tell you that I was disappointed to learn that the facts that had been conveyed to me by General Flynn were inaccurate.  But we honor General Flynn's long service to the United States of America, and I fully support the President's decision to ask for his resignation.  It was the proper decision.  It was handled properly and in a timely way.\nAnd I have great confidence in the national security team of this administration going forward.  The combination of Secretary Mattis, of Director Pompeo at the CIA, of Secretary Kelly at Homeland Secretary I think gives the American people great confidence that the team in this administration is providing the leadership and the direction to those agencies and also to the President of the United States to advance the security of our people.\nGENERAL SECRETARY STOLTENBERG:  Our collective defense clause, our collective defense commitment is unconditional.  It's absolute, and it's the core of the NATO alliance.  And I welcome the very strong commitment of the United States to this transatlantic bond and to this collective defense clause.\nAt the same time, I fully support what has been underlined by President Trump and by Vice President Pence today, the importance of burden-sharing.  And I think we have to remember that this is not only something that the U.S. is asking for, it's actually something that 28 Allies agreed.  The leaders from 28 NATO-allied countries sat around the same table in 2014 and agreed to stop the cuts, to gradually increase defense spending, and then to meet the 2 percent target within a decade.\nAnd the good news is that we are moving in the right direction.  After many years of decline, after many years of defense cuts across Europe and Canada, we saw that in 2015 we stopped the cuts, the first year after we made the pledge.  And then, in 2016, we had a significant increase of 3.8 percent in real terms, or $10 billion.\nThere is a long way to go, and much remains to be done, but at least we have turned a corner and we have started to move in the right direction.  I am encouraged by that, and I expect all allies to make good on the promise that they made in 2014 to increase defense spending and to make sure to have a fairer burden-sharing.\nQ    A question to the Vice President and the Secretary General.  The German Foreign Minister has called the 2 percent goal too ambitious, and said that more spending would not necessarily lead to more security.  Are you disappointed by that?  And what would be the consequence if a country like Germany would not hold up to the 2 percent goal?\nAnd a question to the Vice President, if I may.  President Trump has repeatedly talked about his war with the press.  Since NATO is an alliance of values, can you assure the allies that the freedom of press is not under threat in the United States?  Thank you.\nGENERAL SECRETARY STOLTENBERG:  All allies have committed to the defense investment pledge, meaning to stop the cuts and to start to increase.  And that also includes Germany, and it has also been clearly expressed from Germany that they are committed to the defense investment pledge we made together in 2014.\nThe good thing is that Germany has started to increase defense spending.  In 2017, there will be a significant increase in German defense spending, with around or by -- around 8 percent.  So, of course, Germany, as many other allies, have a long way to go.  And some allies will meet the 2 percent target within a year or two.  Romania declared last week that they will meet the 2 percent target this year.  Lithuania and Latvia will soon be able to meet the 2 percent target also within a year or two.\nSo we are really making progress.  Germany has started to increase defense spending.  And again, I expect all allies to keep the pledge they made together as leaders in 2014.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Let me say again:  The President and I, our administration, are very grateful for the Secretary General's focus on burden-sharing and for our NATO allies, whether it be Germany or other countries, to meet the commitment that treaty allies made to one another.\nI think it's a demonstration of President Trump's leadership that before taking office he was speaking about the fact that the United States provides more than 70 percent of the cost of NATO today, and we are committed to continue to do our part, but that the time has come for our NATO allies to step forward.  And the Secretary General's strong message on this is in all of our collective interest.\nI will tell you that I had very productive discussions with Chancellor Merkel.  We spoke about just this issue.  And we look forward to a continued dialogue.  Our hope is that we will have a date very soon where Chancellor Merkel will come to the White House.  I expect the President will talk with her about it, as well.  But this is simply about all of us doing what we all said we would do -- to provide for our common defense.  And in the ever-changing threat environment in which we live, that's more important now than ever.\nWith regard to your second question, rest assured that both the President and I strongly support a free and independent press.  But you can anticipate that the President and all of us will continue to call out the media when they play fast and loose with the facts.  And the truth is that we have in President Trump someone who has a unique ability to speak directly to the American people.  And when the media gets it wrong, I promise you President Trump will take his case straight to the American people to set the record straight.\nQ    Mr. Vice President, you said the U.S. commitment to the EU was steadfast and enduring.  Is the administration opposed to further disintegration of the EU, further countries exiting?  And on NATO, what is the or else?  If there isn’t more defense spending this year, would you recommend cutting the European Reassurance Initiative?  Would you cut back on exercises?  What's the or else?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, I think your second question is a very fair one.  What is the “or else”?  I think when Secretary Mattis was here, he spoke very plainly here at NATO's headquarters about the frustration of the American people, that as our country continues to make investments in Europe's security, we see European countries falling behind.  The President really put this issue front and center, before the American people in his campaign for President.  And, frankly, it struck a very resonant chord.\nAnd so I don’t know what the answer is to “or else,” but I know that the patience of the American people will not endure forever; that the commitment that we have made to one another, that the American people are keeping with the people of Europe and NATO, is a commitment that the President of the United States and the American people expect our allies in Europe to keep, as well.  But failing that, questions about the future we'll just leave in the future as hypotheticals.\nBut I have to tell you, with the Secretary General's strong leadership, having made the issue of burden-sharing his top priority, having a partnership with so many countries across NATO who, in my meetings over this weekend, have expressed a desire to step forward and keep their word, I'm very encouraged about the progress.  What you see happening here is in a very real sense the result of American leadership.  In President Trump we have a President who is stepping forward, he's expressing American leadership not just on the issue of funding, but also on his call last year that NATO should evolve to widen its tactics to include counterterrorism as a major focus.  And NATO has begun to do that.  The United States looks forward to supporting that.\nWith regard to the European Union, my message very simply was that the United States is committed to continuing our partnership with the European Union.  And I wanted to make that very clear.  We understand the relationship between our economies.  We understand the deep heritage of member states in the European Union with people in the United States of America.  Looking for ways that we could reassure this weekend leaders of the European Union of our commitment to ongoing cooperation and that maintaining that partnership in the years ahead is hopefully a resonant message that came through, and it's my great privilege to be here to deliver it.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Let me just add that the focus of the alliance is on how can we make sure that we succeed in delivering on what we agreed about fairer burden-sharing and increased defense spending.  And, therefore, I will not speculate so much about “or else,” what will happen if we don’t succeed.  But we heard a very firm and clear message from the United States.  We heard it from the President, we heard it from the Vice President, and from Secretary Mattis at the defense ministerial meeting.\nSo I think that just underlines the importance of making sure that we move, that we succeed in increasing defense spending across Europe and Canada.  And the good thing is that we have started; 3.8 percent real increase in 2016 is a significant step, but is only one step in the right direction.  We need much more.\nLet me also add that we need both to spend more, but we also need to spend better.  So the focus of the alliance, the focus of the defense ministers, but also in our cooperation with the European Union, is how can we increase efficiency, how can we develop cooperation, how can we make sure that we address the fragmentation of especially European defense industry so we can reduce costs and get more out of the money we invest in our defense.\nBut there is no way we can choose between either spend more or better.  We need to spend both more and better.  So what we committed in 2014 was not either to spend more or to spend better, but it was to spend 2 percent of GDP in a better way, and we are addressing both things, and we are moving forward on both tracks.\nEND\n4:44 P.M.

EST\nMRS. TRUMP:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Let us pray.  (A prayer is given.)\nGood afternoon.  It is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the First Lady of the United States.  (Applause.)  The America we envision is one that works for all Americans and where all Americans can work and succeed -- a nation committed to greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide.\nI will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me.  (Applause.)  I will act in the best interest of all of you.  I'm committed to creating and supporting initiatives dear to my heart, which will have impact on women and children all around the world.  (Applause.)\nMy husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  Thank you all.  I didn’t know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nIt's so great to be here in Florida, my second home, with you.  This is a state I truly love.  This is a state where we all had great victory together.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  It's now been one month since my inauguration, and I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in Making America Great Again.  (Applause.)  And I’m also here to tell you about our plans for the future.  And they're big and they're bold, and it's what our country is all about, believe me.  (Applause.)\nI'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people.  (Applause.)  This was a great movement -- a movement like has never been seen before in our country, or probably anywhere else.  This was a truly great movement, and I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you, I promise you.  (Applause.)  I want to be in a room filled with hardworking American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag, and who pray for a better future.  (Applause.)\nI also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news.  (Applause.)  The dishonest media, which has published one false story after another, with no sources, even though they pretend they have them -- they make them up in many cases -- they just don’t want to report the truth, and they've been calling us wrong now for two years.  They don’t get it, but they're starting to get it, I can tell you that.  (Applause.)  They've become a big part of the problem.  They are part of the corrupt system.\nThomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, and many of our greatest Presidents, fought with the media and called them out, oftentimes on their lies.  When the media lies to people, I will never, ever, let them get away with it.  I will do whatever I can that they don’t get away with it.  (Applause.)  They have their own agenda, and their agenda is not your agenda.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, Thomas Jefferson said, \"Nothing can [now] be believed which is seen in a newspaper.\"  \"Truth itself,\" he said, \"becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.\"  That was June 14th -- my birthday -- (laughter and applause) -- 1807.\nBut despite all their lies, misrepresentations and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are.  And, most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.  (Applause.)\nWe are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe.  We are free and independent people, and we will make our own choices.  (Applause.)  We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I hear your demands, I hear your voices, and I promise you I will deliver.  I promise that.  (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time.  The White House is running so smoothly.  So smoothly.  (Applause.)  And believe me, I -- and we -- inherited one big mess.  That, I can tell you.  But I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug deals who are right now, as I speak, being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.  (Applause.)  We will have strong borders again.  (Applause.)  And I mean that.  And you've seen it on television.  You've seen it on television.\nGeneral Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job.  You're seeing it.  The gang members -- bad, bad people.  I said it day one.  And they're going out, or they're being put in prison.  But for the most part, get them the hell out of there.  Bring them back to where they came from.  (Applause.)\nThe fact is, you want great schools for your children, you want good, high-paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved one, and for the future of your families.  You want a health care system -- and, by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great health care plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.  (Applause.)  It will be repealed and replaced.  And for those people, the people that are put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn’t matter what they say -- for those people, just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower cost, okay?  (Applause.)  Nothing to complain about.  Obamacare, remember, it is a disaster.\nYou want low-cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shale, on natural gas, and on clean -- very clean coal.  We're going to put the miners back to work.  The miners go back to work.  (Applause.)  You want us to enforce our immigration laws and to defend our borders.  You want fair trade deals and a level playing field.  We don’t have a level playing field.  Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins, and wins big.  And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the stupidity of our politicians.  It's not going to happen any longer.  (Applause.)\nYou want lower taxes, less regulation, millions of new jobs, and more products stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words: \"Made in the USA.\"  (Applause.)  You want to make it easier for companies to do business in America and harder for companies to leave.  We don’t want companies saying, \"Everybody is fired, we're moving to another country, we're going to make the product, sell it across the border, and isn’t wonderful?\"  Not going to happen anymore.  We're going to have strong borders.  And when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35 percent tax.  And you know what?  They're never going to leave.  They will never, ever leave.  (Applause.)  And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months, even before I got into office.  They're not leaving.  And if they do, they're going to pay a very, very big price for terminating the relationship to our workers.\nYou want a government that serves the people -- not the donors and not the special interests.  In short, you want a government that keeps its promises.  A great spirit of optimism is sweeping -- and you see it -- it's sweeping all across the country.  Look at what's happening to the stock market.  Look at what's happening to every poll when it comes to optimism in our country.  It's sweeping across the country.  And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days, the stock market, meaning companies, have been hitting new highs.  They're going to start hiring.  It's going to be a new day in America.  You're going to be proud again.  (Applause.)\nJobs are already starting to pour back in.  They're coming back in like you haven’t seen in a long time.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs, investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country.\nIn Arizona, Intel -- great company -- just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand-new, beautiful American jobs.  (Applause.)\nI've followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job-killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- TPP.  We have just terminated our relationship to it.  We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or, as we would say, one-on-one.  None of these deals where we get caught in quick sand, where we get mired in and we can't do anything about it, like, by the way, NAFTA and so many others.\nAnd my administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation, which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers.  We're going to end it.  (Applause.)\nWithin a few days of taking the Oath of Office, I’ve taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines.  (Applause.)  Anywhere from 30,000 to 40,000 jobs.  And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said, who makes the pipe?  Who makes the pipe?  Something this audience understands very well, right?  Simple question.  The lawyers put this very complex document in front.  I said, who makes the pipe?  They said, sir, it can be made anywhere.  I said, not anymore.  So I put a little clause on the bottom:  The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pipelines.  (Applause.)\nWe believe in two simple rules.  And I can tell you, everybody in this massive -- this is a massive hangar; this is for the big planes.  And, by the way, do you think that one media group back there, that one network, will show this crowd?  Not one.  Not one.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not one.  They won't show the crowd.\nYou know, coming in on the plane -- and that plane represents so much -- and just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One.  Can you believe this?  I said, no way.  I said, I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane.  (Applause.)  I refuse.  So I got Boeing in -- and it is actually -- a lot of people don’t know -- the Air Force One project is actually two planes.  Why they need two planes, we'll have to talk about that.  But they have two planes.  But we've got that price down by over a billion dollars.  And I probably haven’t spoken, to be honest with you, for more than an hour on the project.  But I got the generals in, who are fantastic.  I got Boeing in.  But I told Boeing it's not good enough, we're not going to do it -- the price is still too high.\nOn the F-35 fighter jet, we were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget, seven years late.  Great plane.  Lockheed Martin -- a great plane.  So think of it:  They're seven years late, they're hundreds of -- billions of dollars over budget.  Other than that, by the way, the project is going extremely well.  And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin, who are terrific people and a terrific product, by the way.  I also got Boeing in.  I said, do me a favor, give me a competing offer.  And now they're competing and fighting, and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered.\nIn other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to Lockheed and Boeing.  They would have signed contracts.  So they're going to make plenty of money but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump.  That, I can tell you.  And you might as well know about it -- (applause) -- because nobody talks.  And, by the way, that's for fighter jets -- one of the biggest orders in the history of aviation, the order for the F-35 you've been reading about it -- because it was a disaster under the last administration.  A disaster.  And now we have it running beautifully.\nIn fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan -- Prime Minister Abe, who's great; great guy -- when he came over, he said, thank you.  I said, for what?  \"You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet.\"  Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation.  So the first thing he did was he thanked me for saving them money, and that's good.  Okay?  That's good.  (Applause.)  I know the media will never thank me, so at least Japan is thanking me, right?  (Applause.)\nBut we believe in two simple rules:  Buy American and hire American.  We believe in them.  (Applause.)  We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, a new director was just approved.  Can you imagine the length of time it's taking the Democrats?  And I actually think it's an embarrassment to them.  But this is getting to be record-setting territory.  These are incredible people.\nScott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved, for the Environmental Protection Agency.  He'll do so good.  (Applause.)  He'll do so good.  But he won’t have projects going 10 and 12 years and then getting rejected.  And they may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly.  But for the most part, they're going to be accepted, they're going to be environmentally friendly, and he is going to be a great Secretary.  He will be amazing.  So we're very happy.  That took place yesterday.\nThat's going to be a big difference, because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations.  It was impossible to navigate for companies.  And what did it really mean?  Forget about the companies.  What did it mean?  It meant no jobs.  It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things that they'd rather do here.  So we're going to have a whole big situation.  We are going to unfree all of those companies.  They are going to be -- they're going to have freedom.  They're going to be able to build what they want to build.  It will be environmentally friendly.  And we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before.  That's going to happen.  That was a big thing. (Applause.)\nWe're standing up for the incredible men and women, always, of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  We're standing up.  And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement, they stood up big.  I don’t say for me -- I'm the messenger, folks; I'm the messenger.  They stood up for us in this last election.  We got numbers that nobody believed were possible, from law enforcement and from military -- basically people that where uniforms like us.  Isn't that nice?\nAnd I saw this man on television just now.  You -- I just saw him on television.  He said, \"I love Trump.  Let Trump do what he has to do.\"  That's my guy, right there.  (Applause.)  It's true.  Come here.  Come here.  No, I just -- I'm coming in.  That's okay.  Let him up.  Let him up.  I'm not worried about him.  I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss.  I'm not worried about anything else.  This guy is so great.  He was one of many people -- they're interviewing people in the line -- and I have to say, there's a tiny group of protestors out there, and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people.  But they interviewed this man.  Come on up here.  Come on up.  This guy is great.  Hop over the fence.  Come on.  He can do it.  This guy is in good shape.  Look at him.  Look at this guy.  Come on.  This guy is great.  Don't worry about it.  No, no, no come here.  They're going to throw -- come on up.  Come on.  Come here.  (Applause.)\nThis guy -- so he's been all over television, saying the best things, and I see him standing.  Didn’t you get here like at four in the morning?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  I did, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say a couple of words to this crowd.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Mr. President, thank you, sir.  We, the people, our movement, is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today.  (Applause.)  When President Trump, during the election, promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.  (Applause.)\nMr. President, thank you so much, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A star is born.  A star is born.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  That's fine.\nAUDIENCE:  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I wouldn’t say that Secret Service was thrilled with that -- (laughter) -- but we know our people, right?  We know our people.  (Applause.)  He's a great guy.  And so many others.  I see some others, they're being interviewed.  I see them over here.  They started -- they came at four in the morning.  The media will give them no credit.  The media, as I told you, they won't show this crowd.  Look at that -- all the way outside.  This is as big a hangar as you get.  All the way outside, way back to the fences.  Amazing.  I want to thank you.  But I want to thank everybody.\nSo I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs and police from crimes of violence against them.  (Applause.)  We will work with our police, not against our police.  Our police do a great job, and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now.  It's very unfair what's happening.  So we want to cherish our law enforcement, and we will always protect those who protect us.\nWe’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities.  We're going to make our inner cities safe again.  Look at what's going on.  Look at what's happening in Chicago.  Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths.  I'll tell you, what's happening in Chicago and many other places.  Safety is a civil right, and we will fight to make America totally safe again.\nI’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels, which are all over the United States, and we are going to stop the drugs from pouring into your country, into your community, into your cities, and poisoning our youth.  We're stopping it.  (Applause.)  We're stopping it.\nWe’ve taken historic action to secure the southern border, and I’ve ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.  (Applause.)  And I’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.  (Applause.)\nSo you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing, and so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court, originally by a judge, and then a --\nAUDIENCE:  Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  It's very sad.  And, you know, the reason is for protection and safety.  So the statute is so plain and so clear.  I said last week -- I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said, if you have a college education, you can understand it; if you have a high school education, you can understand it; if you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.  And I was told -- I'll check, but I found it hard to believe -- in an over 30-page decision by the appellate court, three judges -- and you could tell by the way they were reacting, because it was broadcast on television, and everything we do gets a lot of people watching.  So you could tell by the way that phone call went, it wasn’t looking good.  And when they wrote their decision, as I understand it -- maybe I'm wrong -- but they didn’t write the statute they were making the decision about, because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side.\nSo I thought I'd read it, and here's what it says.  This is what it says:  \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States\" -- okay, so essentially, whenever somebody comes into the United States, right -- if it \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States\" -- okay, now you know the countries we're talking about, and these were countries picked by Obama; they weren’t even picked -- they were picked by Obama -- \"he may\" -- so the President may -- \"by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary\" -- now, because it's old, it should have said he or she, right?  They were not politically correct when they drew this.  In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it.  He or she -- but I don’t think the women care too much about that, right?  I don’t think so.\nBy the way, we did very well with women.  (Applause.)  You know, my wife said, when some of these phony polls were put out -- you know, the CNN poll was so far off -- the phony polls.  But when some of these -- she said, what's wrong with you and women?  We did very nicely with women.  We did nicely with a lot of groups that they didn’t think we were going to do so nicely with.  I guess we had to.  That's why we're all here tonight, right?  (Applause.)\nSo, and it goes, \"…and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"  So basically it says the President has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country.  Right?  (Applause.)  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk.  So unfair.\nSo we'll be doing something over the next couple of days.  We don’t give up.  We never give up.  (Applause.)  We had a court that I disagree with, I disagree with big league.  And, by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television, when other lawyers come on many of them can't even understand.  They're saying, how do you come up with that decision?  It cannot be more simple.  So they're ruling on what I just read you, and they don’t even quote it in their ruling -- because you can't, because it's too obvious.  So we will do something next week.  I think you'll be impressed.  Let's see what happens.\nHere's the bottom line:  We've got to keep our country safe.  You look at what's happening.  We've got to keep our country safe.  (Applause.)  You look at what's happening in Germany.  You look at what's happening last night in Sweden.  Sweden?  Who would believe this?  Sweden?  They took in large numbers.  They're having problems like they never thought possible.  You look at what's happening in Brussels.  You look at what's happening all over the world.  Take a look at Nice.  Take a look at Paris.  We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people.  There was no documentation.  There was no nothing.\nSo we're going to keep our country safe.  (Applause.)  And we all have heart, by the way.  And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country -- that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else.  Folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn’t believe.  But we're going to build safe zones.  We're going to have those safe zones.  You know, we do owe $20 trillion, okay?  So we're going to have the Gulf States pay for those safe zones.  They have nothing but money.  And we're going to do it that way, instead of taking massive numbers -- tens of thousands of people -- into our country, and we don’t know anything about those people.\nWe want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us.  We want people that can cherish us and their traditions of our country.  We want people that are going to be great for our country.  We don’t want people with bad, bad ideas.  We don’t want that.\nI've also directed the defense community, headed by General, and now Sec -- oh, you know, he said it -- he said it -- and now Secretary “Mad Dog” Mattis -- (applause) -- to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS.  (Applause.)  I have ordered the Department of Defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the United States military.  (Applause.)  We will pursue peace through strength.  Our military is badly depleted.  You have planes in the military where the father flew them and now the son is flying them, they're so old.  We make the best equipment anywhere in the world.  We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.  (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to make sure that our veterans have the care they need when they come home.  (Applause.)  We love our veterans.  (Applause.)  We're going to do a great job for our veterans.  Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated.  These are our great, great people.  We owe them so much.  Our veterans are going to be taken care for once and for all.  Our system and our country has let down our veterans.  We are not going to let that go on any further.  You wait until you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans.  Thank you, veterans, for all -- who's here?  Who's a veteran?  (Applause.)  We're going to take care of our veterans.\nWe're going to downsize the bloated bureaucracy and make government lean and accountable.  We are going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  Drain the swamp!  Drain the swamp!  Drain the swamp!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I've already imposed -- I'm not sure they're too happy about it -- a five-year lobbying ban on executive branch officials, and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.  (Applause.)\nAnd there's another major promise I have kept to the American people:  I’ve nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late, great Justice Scalia.  (Applause.)  His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.  (Applause.)  And he comes from my list of 20 very, very highly-qualified judges.  He's incredible, and he has an incredible résumé.  He's respected by all.  His education is as good as it can get.  His writings are truly amazing.  He will be a true defender of our Constitution.\nSo let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country.  Because what's happening with the Democrats -- no wonder they're doing so badly.  No wonder they're doing so badly.  You take a look.  Race after race -- I just want to tell you, in case you didn’t read it -- of course, you're reading the fake news -- but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency.  That didn’t happen.  They were supposed to take over the Senate.  That didn’t happen.  And they were supposed to take over, potentially, even the House.  It was going to be, four weeks out, the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics.  And it was -- but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans.  (Applause.)\nSo we have to tell the Democrats -- because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people -- to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction.  They got to get on with it.\nMy administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform.  We are working to lower tax rates on the middle class, to reduce tax rates, big league, on businesses, and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans, so it's understandable by everyone.  (Applause.)\nSenate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs.  But the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare, and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nationwide health care tragedy.  It's a tragedy.  You look at some states -- Arizona -- up 116 percent.  And your deductibles have gotten so high that you can never use it.  Obamacare doesn’t work.  It's become totally unaffordable.  Remember they said to health care -- it's unaffordable.  It doesn’t work.  And I said to the Republicans, I said, you want to do something great politically?  Don't do anything.  Sit back for two years, let it explode; the Democrats will come and beg for us to do something.  But we can't do that to the American people.  We have to fix it, and we will.  (Applause.)\nWe need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and highways, and railways all across our great nation.\nYou are all part of this incredible movement -- this movement that we talk about so much, that's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world.  It's a movement that is just sweeping -- it's sweeping across our country.  It's sweeping, frankly, across the globe.  Look at Brexit.  Look at Brexit.  Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at.\nPeople want to take back control of their countries, and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.  (Applause.)  The nation-state remains the best model for human happiness, and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom, and justice on the face of God’s Earth.  (Applause.)  And now we have spirit like we've never had before.  It's now that we have our sacred duty, and we have no choice, and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values, and to serve its great, great citizens.  (Applause.)\nErasing national borders does not make people safer or more prosperous -- it undermines democracy and trades away prosperity.  We're giving it away.  The so-called global elite have done very well for themselves, but have left working families with shrinking wages, really -- I mean, they are shrinking.  Eighteen years ago, many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs.  (Applause.)\nInstead of peace, we’ve seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away.  We don’t fight to win.  We fight politically correct wars.  We don’t win anymore.  We don’t win at trade.  We don’t win in any capacity.  We don’t win anymore.  We're going to start winning again, believe me.  (Applause.)\nAnd we have the chance now, working together, to deliver change for the ages -- this will be change for the ages, change like never before; to pursue real peace, real stability and real prosperity.  We want to secure our borders and protect our workers; to rebuild our military and our infrastructure; to fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods; to bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities; to ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce; to reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation; and to replace chasms of distrust with new bridges of opportunity and cooperation.\nWe must ignore the tired echoes of yesterday’s fights.  We're fighting battles that no longer help us.  We're fighting battles that other people aren’t treating us fairly in the fight.  I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries.  They're not paying their bills.  They're not paying their bills.  They have to help us.  No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past.  No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about but failure.  New circumstances demand new solutions.\nAmericans have fought and won wars together.  Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives.  Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next, stretching back to the first day of our American independence.\nThis is our legacy.  It belongs to all of you.  And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.  (Applause.)\nNow is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold action.  Let us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country.  We are all brothers and all sisters.  We share one home, one destiny, and one glorious American flag.  (Applause.)\nWe're united together by history and by providence.  We will make America strong again, I promise.  We will make America proud again.  We will make America safe again.  And we will make America great again -- greater than ever before.  (Applause.)\nMay God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n6:34 P.M.

Your struggles are our struggles.  Your success is our success, and ultimately, we walk into the future together.\nThis is President Trump’s promise:  We will stand with Europe, today and every day, because we are bound together by the same noble ideals -- freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.\nSo strong is our bond that over the past century, Americans have poured forth from our land to help defend yours.  It’s remarkable to think that this year marks the 100th anniversary of the United States’ entry into World War One.\nMore than two decades later, in the fires of World War Two, we fought to defeat dictatorship and keep the flame of freedom alive in Europe and across the entire world.\nTens of thousands of my fellow countrymen now rest here for eternity.  Tens of thousands more still stand guard here in Europe to this day.\nSo lest anyone doubt the United States’ commitment to Europe and the importance of your defense, they need only look to our nation’s investment in your peace and prosperity, in your safety and security, yesterday and today.  And it has been an investment of treasure, yes, but so much more than that, America has sent you our best and bravest.  (Applause.)\nOur shared values and our shared sacrifices are the source of the United States’ enduring bond to the nations and peoples of Europe.  We honor that history by doing our part -- all of us -- to ensure the horrors of war never return to this continent.\nFor generations, we have worked side by side with you to strengthen and defend your democracies.  Together, we formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 to defend our shared heritage and shared principles, such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination.  We confronted the menace of Communism, which threatened to overwhelm Europe and the world in its heartless, inhuman embrace.  We stood together in 1990 as this very nation reunited and Eastern Europe chose freedom, free markets, and democracy.\nI saw that choice firsthand as a young man.  In 1977, at the age of 18, I traveled through Europe with my older brother, and we found ourselves in West Berlin.  I marveled at the streets, the people, and the bustling commerce of a city renewed just 30 years after the ravages of war.\nThen we crossed through Checkpoint Charlie.  The vibrant color of the free world fell away, replaced by the dour greys of still-bombed-out buildings and the shadow of repression hanging over the people.\nIn that moment, I came face to face with the choice facing the Western World -- the choice between freedom and tyranny.\nBy the grace of God, and through the leadership of Reagan, Thatcher, Kohl, Mitterrand, Havel, Walesa, the wall fell, communism collapsed, and freedom prevailed.\nThe fall of the Soviet Union ushered in an opportunity for unprecedented peace and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.  But the end of that era only marked the beginning of another. The collapse of communism has been followed by the rise of new adversaries and new threats.\nRogue nations developing nuclear weapons now jeopardize the safety of the entire world.  Radical Islamic terrorism has fixated on the destruction of Western civilization.  In the early days of this new century, that enemy struck ruthlessly at our nation’s capital and our greatest city.\nWith the smoke still rising from Ground Zero and the Pentagon, the strength of our alliance shone forth.  Just as the United States stood with Europe through the end of the 20th century, Europe stood tall with the United States at the outset of the 21st.  And the American people will be forever grateful.\nAgain I had the privilege to see our bond firsthand.  Only two weeks after those horrific attacks on 9/11, as a member of Congress I traveled to Germany to participate in an international conference on terrorism.  I’ll never forget what I saw as we arrived at the American Embassy in Berlin -- a wall of flowers, 10-feet high, surrounded it; fragrant tokens of condolences, support, and prayers of your people for ours.\nThat image will forever be etched in my heart and mind.  But the support of the European community went well beyond acts of kindness.  For the first and only time in its history, NATO invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, fulfilling our commitment to confront our common enemies together, and the American people will never forget it.\nIn the global war against radical Islamic terrorists, we have been bound by shared sacrifice.  For the past decade and a half, the nations of NATO and many other allies have answered the call to rid the world of this great evil.  From Afghanistan to Iraq to many other conflicts across the globe, our sons and daughters have served together and fought together on the field of battle.\nThousands of our citizens, coming from every corner of this alliance and beyond, have given their lives in this struggle.  Fighting alongside U.S. servicemembers under NATO's mandate, more than 1,100 brave men and women from allied nations have fallen in Afghanistan since 2001.  The Afghanis have lost many more in order to free their homeland and keep it free today.\nNo matter which country they hailed from, these heroes gave the last full measure of their devotion in the cause of our peace and our security.   And I hope each one of you will assure their families, the families of their fallen that the American people will never forget their service and sacrifice on our behalf.  (Applause.)\nNow, those sacrifices, which continue to this day, are the surest sign of our enduring commitment to each other and our future together.\nOn President Trump’s behalf, that future is exactly what I came here to address.\nIf the past century has taught us anything, it’s that peace and prosperity in Europe and the North Atlantic can never be regarded as achieved; it must be continually maintained through shared sacrifice and shared commitment.\nPeace only comes through strength.\nPresident Trump believes we must be strong in our military might, able to confront any and all who would threaten our freedom and our way of life.  We must be strong in our conviction that our cause is just and that our way of life is worth defending.  If we lose the will to do our part to defend ourselves, we jeopardize our shared heritage of freedom.\nUnder President Trump’s leadership, I can assure you, the United States will be strong -- stronger than ever before.  We will strengthen our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and working with many of the members of the Congress who are gathered here today, we’re going to provide our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard with renewed resources to defend our nation and our treaty allies from the known threats of today and the unknown threats of tomorrow.\nAs we speak, the United States is developing plans for significant increases in military spending to ensure that the strongest military in the world is stronger still.\nWe will meet our obligations to our people to provide for the common defense, and we’ll continue to do our part to support our allies in Europe and in NATO.\nBut Europe’s defense requires your commitment as much as ours.  Our transatlantic alliance has at its core two principles that are central to its mission.  In Article 5, we pledged to come to each other’s aid in the event of an attack.\nAnd to be ready, if and when that day comes, in Article 3 we vowed in that treaty to contribute our fair share to our common defense.  The promise to share the burden of our defense has gone unfulfilled for too many for too long, and it erodes the very foundation of our alliance.\nWhen even one ally fails to do their part, it undermines our ability to come to each other’s aid.  At that Wales summit in 2014, all 28 members of NATO declared their intention to move towards a minimum security commitment of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within the decade.\nIn the words of the summit’s declaration, such investments were necessary in “meeting NATO’s capability targets and filling NATO’s capability shortfalls.”\nAs of this moment, the United States and only four other NATO members meet this basic standard.  Now, while we commend the few nations that are on track to achieve that goal, the truth is that many others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a clear and credible path to meeting this minimum goal.\nLet me be clear on this point, the President of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfill this commitment, and for most that means the time has come to do more.  (Applause.)\nWe must shoulder this responsibility together because the dangers we face are growing and changing every day.  The world is now a more dangerous place than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter century ago.  The threats to our safety and security span the globe, from the rise of radical Islamic terrorism, to the threats posed by Iran and North Korea, and to many others who threaten our security and our way of life.\nThe rise of adversaries new and old demands a strong response from all of us.\nIn the east, NATO has markedly improved its deterrent posture by stationing four combat-ready multinational battalions in Poland and the Baltic States.\nIn the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force, rest assured the United States, along with the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, will continue its leadership role as a framework nation in the Enhanced Forward Presence Initiative, and we will support other critical joint actions to support this alliance.  (Applause.)\nAnd with regard to Ukraine, we must continue to hold Russia accountable and demand that they honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning by de-escalating the violence in eastern Ukraine.\nAnd know this:  The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which, as you know, President Trump believes can be found.\nTo the south, upheavals in Africa and the Middle East have sent violence rippling in every direction, reaching not only Europe but also the United States.\nToday, the leading state sponsor of terrorism continues to destabilize the Middle East, and thanks to the end of nuclear-related sanctions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran now has additional resources to devote to these efforts.\nLet me be clear again:  Under President Trump, the United States will remain fully committed to ensuring that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon capable of threatening our countries, our allies in the region, especially Israel.  (Applause.)\nThroughout the Middle East, radical Islamic terrorists have found safe havens and secured vast resources that have allowed them to launch attacks here in Europe and inspire attacks in the United States.\nDriven by evil, they target their own communities, their fellow Muslims, indiscriminately killing or enslaving those who reject their apocalyptic mania.\nFrom Yemen to Libya, Nigeria to Syria, the rise of extremist groups ranging from ISIS and al-Qaeda, to al-Shabaab and Boko Haram endanger millions, including many faith-based peoples whose roots in their homelands extend into the mists of history.\nISIS is perhaps the greatest evil of them all.  It showed a savagery unseen in the Middle East since the Middle Ages.\nAs President Trump has made clear, the United States will fight tirelessly to crush these enemies -- especially ISIS and its so-called caliphate -- and consign them to the ash heap of history, where they belong.  (Applause.)\nLast month, the President ordered the development of a comprehensive plan to utterly defeat ISIS.  President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people and ensuring the security of our treaty allies.\nTo confront the threats facing our alliance today, NATO must build upon its 20th century tactics and continue to evolve to confront the crises of today and tomorrow.\nLast summer President Trump called on NATO to step up its efforts to disrupt terrorist plots before they ever reach our borders.  And we've made great progress in expanding cooperation and information sharing between our intelligence and security services in recent years.  But we must do more -- much more.\nConsistent with the President’s call, we are heartened to see that NATO has taken steps to increase focus on counter-terrorism and collaboration.  The appointment of a new intelligence chief, charged with facilitating collaboration on counterterrorism, marks a positive strategic shift in NATO’s ability to fulfill its mission.\nGoing forward, we must intensify our efforts to cut off terrorists’ funding, increase our cyber capabilities.  We must be as dominant in the digital world as we are in the physical world.  (Applause.)\nWe must always stay at least one step ahead of our adversaries.  For our shared goal of peace and prosperity can only be achieved through superiority and strength.\nFor our part, thanks to President Trump, the United States will be stronger than ever before.  Our leadership of the free world will not falter, even for a moment.  Our strength, and that of this alliance, is not derived solely from our strength of arms, though.  It’s borne of our shared principles, the principles and ideals that we cherish -- freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.  These are the wellspring of the United States’ strength and of Europe’s strength.\nThey spring from that timeless notion that our unalienable rights -- of life and liberty -- are not granted to us by sovereigns, or governments, or kings.  They are, as the American Founders observed, endowed by our Creator.  Marshalling the will to confront the evils of the 21st century will require faith, faith in these timeless ideals.\nAnd as President Trump has said in his Inaugural Address, it’s important to know:  “We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.”\nThis then is our cause.  It’s why NATO exists.  It’s why, after so many centuries of strife and division, Europe is unified.\nThe United States has been faithful to Europe for generations, and we will keep the faith that drove our forefathers to sacrifice so much in defense of our shared heritage.\nWe share a past, and after all we’ve been through, we share a future.  Today, tomorrow, and every day hence be confident that the United States is now and will always be your greatest ally.  (Applause.)\nBe assured, President Trump and the American people are fully devoted to our transatlantic union.\nOur choice today is the same as it was in ages past:  security through shared sacrifice and strength, or an uncertain future characterized by disunity and faltering will.\nWell, the United States chooses strength.  The United States chooses friendship with Europe and a strong North Atlantic alliance.\nAnd in the name of all the sacrifices of the generations who have gone before, who have fought and bled and died for this alliance, with confidence in all of you, and firm reliance on Providence, I know the best days for America, for Europe, and for the free world are yet to come.\nThank you for the honor of joining you today and God bless you all.  (Applause.)\nEND", "timestamp": "2017-02-18T00:00:00", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the Munich Security Conference"}

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dennis.  And I have to say, I love South Carolina.  I love it.  (Applause.)\nRemember we came down -- all together, we came down, and this was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide.  This was a good one.  (Applause.)  So I want to thank the people of South Carolina and your governor -- tremendous guy.  He supported us right from the beginning.  So I'd like to thank Governor McMaster for the incredible job.  He's right here someplace.  Thank you very much.  You have been fantastic.\nAnd I have to say also, that is one beautiful airplane.  (Applause.)  Congratulations to the men and women here who have built it.  What an amazing piece of art.  What an amazing piece of work.\nThank you, Dennis, for the invitation to be with you today.  You know, in the old days, when I made this speech I got paid a lot of money.  Now I have to do it for nothing.  (Laughter and applause.)  Not a good deal, but that's okay.  We love it.\nIt’s wonderful to be back in South Carolina, especially with your new governor.  Where is Henry?  He's around here someplace.  Where is he?  Stand up, Henry.  Proud of you.  He helped us so much.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to also thank your former governor, Nikki Haley, who is doing an awfully good job for us.  (Applause.)  She's representing America very well as our ambassador to the United Nations.  She is doing a spectacular job.  It's early, but she has just been really great.\nWe're here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing.  We're also here today to celebrate jobs.  Jobs.  (Applause.)  This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina.  Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made right here in the U.S.A.  (Applause.)\nIt’s amazing to think that a little over 113 years ago, next door, in North Carolina, Orville Wright was the first man to sail the skies in a very little airplane.  The 1903 Wright Flyer was made of mostly wood and cloth.  It was so small that Orville's brother, Wilbur, could not join him on the flight.  He was always very upset about that.  The flight lasted all of 12 seconds, but it was incredible.\nThat flight was a testament to the American spirit.  I see that same spirit everywhere I travel in the country.  I saw that spirit all throughout the campaign.  We have the greatest people anywhere in the world.  We have the greatest spirit, and you just look at what's going on today in our country -- you look at what's happening with jobs.  You look at what's happening with plants moving back into our country.  All of a sudden, they're coming back.  And they're going to be very happy about it, believe me.  (Applause.)  They're going to be very, very happy.  (Applause.)\nAs your President, I am going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work.  (Applause.)  This is our mantra: Buy American and Hire American.  (Applause.)\nWe want products made in America, made by American hands.  You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota.  And I’m getting ready to sign the bill.  I said, where is the pipe made?  And they told me not here.  I said, that's good -- add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel.  (Applause.)  And you know what?  That's the way it is.  It’s the way it’s going to be.\nWe are going to fight for every last American job.  We’ve come a long way since the Wright Brothers and their first flight more than a century ago.  Your plane is made of carbon fiber.  It seats 330 passengers.  It’s 18 feet longer than the previous version of the 787.  And this airplane can fly for half a day before it touches the ground.  The name says it all: Dreamliner.  Great name.  Our country is all about making dreams come true.\nOver the last number of years, that hasn’t been necessarily the case, but we're going to make it the case again.  (Applause.)\nThat’s what we do in America –- we dream of things, and then we build them.  We turn vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that, believe me, in the months and years to come.  (Applause.)\nI also want to say a word to all of the members of the armed forces who are here with us today in this record crowd.  (Applause.)\nSouth Carolina has a long, very, very, proud military tradition and history.  We salute all South Carolina military families, and we salute all the men and women who wear the uniform.  (Applause.)\nWe are going to fully rebuild our military -- by the way, do you care if we use the F-18 Super Hornets?  (Applause.)  Or do you only care about -- what do you think?  Well -- (jet flies overhead) -- thought that was a Super Hornet.  (Laughter.)  We are looking seriously at a big order, and we’ll see how that -- you know the problem is that Dennis is a very, very tough negotiator.  (Laughter.)  But I think we may get there.\nWe're also working on the Air Force One project, which was a difficult project for previous administrations.  But it looks like we're getting closer and closer.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’re going to ensure that our great service members have the tools, equipment, training and resources they need to get the job done.  (Applause.)  As George Washington said, being prepared for war is the best way to prevent it.  And that's really what it is:  The best way to prevent war, being prepared.  Peace through strength.  We build a military might so great -- and we are going to do that -- that none will dare to challenge it.  None.  (Applause.)\nWe will ensure our men and women in uniform have the latest, the most cutting edge systems in their arsenal.  Right now it’s not that way.  It will be that way very, very soon.  Believe me.  You will be an important player in this effort.\nBoeing has built many important aircraft -- including, as I said, the F-18 Super Hornet, the F-15 Strike Eagle, and the Apache helicopter, just to name a few.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m being very, very serious -- the new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old.  Can you believe it?  What can look so beautiful at 30?  An airplane. (Laughter.)  I don't know.  Which one do we like better folks?  Tell me.  (Applause.)\nOn every front, we are going to work for the American people.  Nowhere in our focus -- and I mean this so strongly -- and our focus has to be so strong, but my focus has been all about jobs.  And jobs is one of the primary reasons I’m standing here today as your President, and I will never, ever disappoint you.  Believe me.  I will not disappoint you.  (Applause.)\nI campaigned on the promise that I will do everything in my power to bring those jobs back into America.  We wanted to make much easier -- it has to be much easier to manufacture in our country and much harder to leave.  I don't want companies leaving our country, making their product, selling it back, no tax, no nothing, firing everybody in our country.  We're not letting that happen anymore, folks.  Believe me.  There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the product, and think that they're going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.  Going to be a lot different.  It’s going to be a lot different.  (Applause.)\nAlready American industry will come roaring back.  And believe me if we -- not me, I’m a messenger -- if we didn't have this victory, we wouldn’t be even talking about it.  To achieve that goal, we’re going to massively reduce job-crushing regulations -- already started; you've seen that -- that send our jobs to those other countries.  We are going to lower taxes on American business so it’s cheaper and easier to produce product and beautiful things like airplanes right here in America.  (Applause.)\nWe are going to enforce -- very strongly enforce our trade rules and stop foreign cheating.  Tremendous cheating.  Tremendous cheating.  We want products made by our workers, in our factories, stamped with those four magnificent words:  Made in the USA.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Since November, jobs have already begun to surge.  We’re seeing companies open up factories in America.  We’re seeing them keep jobs at home.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler -- just to name a very, very few.  So many more already.  They are keeping and bringing thousands of jobs back in country because the business climate, they know, has already changed.\nIn Arizona, Intel announced it will open a new plant that will create 10,000 American jobs.  They are spending billions of dollars.  (Applause.)\nWe will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes -- including for the middle class, including for everyone, and including for business -- and creating a level playing field for our workers.  When there is a level playing field, and I’ve been saying this for a long time, American workers will always, always, always win.  But we don’t have a level playing field.  Very shortly, you will have a level playing field again.  (Applause.)  Because when American workers win, America as a country wins -- big league wins.\nThat’s my message here today.  America is going to start winning again -- winning like never, ever before.  We are not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore in any way, shape or form.  We love America, and we are going to protect America.  We love our workers, and we are going to protect our workers.  We are going to fight for our jobs, we are going to fight for our families and we are going to fight to get more jobs and better-paying jobs for the loyal citizens of our country.  Believe me.  (Applause.)\nYou’ve heard me say it before, and I will say it again:  From now on, it’s going to be America first.  (Applause.)  Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish -- no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach.  Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me -- both of them, when you think about it -- we are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community has the bright future it deserves.  And by the way, those communities are forgotten no longer.  The election took care of that.  (Applause.)\nAnd we will pass on to our children the freedom and prosperity that is their American birthright.  Our children will inherit from us a nation that is strong, that is proud and that is totally free.  And each of you will be part of creating that new American future.\nI want to thank you, South Carolina.  I want to thank the great people of South Carolina.  God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing.  (Applause.)\nThank you, everybody.  Thank you.\nEND\n1:47 P.M.

I have been saying I was going to do that for a long time.\nThis week I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continue to keep my promises to the American People and so much more.\nI signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an anti-coal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats.  Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around - and we are going to turn it around quickly. We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal.\nThat’s why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd-Frank imposed on American energy companies. By stopping this regulation, we are able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job-killing compliance costs.\nBut to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy.\nThat is why I was thrilled to host the White House’s women’s business leaders roundtable—very exciting, great women.\nAs President, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets, and networks of support that they need, and I mean really need. And it’s going to happen.  This is a priority for my Administration.  I campaigned on helping women in the workforce, and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me.\nIn fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week, we announced the creation of the joint United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting.\nThe United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week with our cherished ally, Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House.\nI affirmed to the Prime Minister America’s commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability.  The threat of terrorism—and believe me it is a threat—must be confronted and defeated and we will defeat it.\nWe share with Israel a deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life.\nSo as you head into the President’s Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf.  We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants, or pundits—we are here to work for you, and only for you, the American people.\nThank you, God Bless you and God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-02-17T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump’s Weekly Address"}

EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening.  Please be seated.\nOn behalf of the President of the United States, it will be my great privilege tonight to administer the oath of office to the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.  (Applause.)\nGrateful to be joined by family and friends, but most especially grateful to be joined by Pam Mulvaney.  Pam, thank you for being here and thank you for your family’s commitment to the United States in this new chapter.\nWe also have with us a distinguished group of guests.  Senator Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget, is with us today.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for being with us today.\nSenator Ron Johnson, also on the budget committee.  And the Congressman’s good friends Senator Tom Cotton, Representative Mark Meadows, Representative Justin Amash, and of course, his fellow South Carolinians -- Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott and Representative Joe Wilson.  That's quite a turnout, and I know it means the world to the President, as it does to our new director.  Give all these members a round of applause.  (Applause.)\nIn Congressman Mick Mulvaney, President Trump has nominated someone with an extraordinary record in public and private life.  He once described himself as a serial entrepreneur, starting no fewer than four businesses over the course of his life.  And along the way, he established himself as a principled, results-driven leader.  And he’ll be bringing those leadership qualities and his well-earned reputation for fiscal responsibility to his new role leading the Office of Management and Budget.\nThese qualities have served him well in public office.  In 2006, he won a seat in South Carolina’s House of Representatives, followed two years later by a seat in the state senate.  Two years after that, he ran for the United States Congress on a promise of faithfully serving the good people of the Palmetto State.  I had the great pleasure of knowing Congressman Mulvaney as a member of Congress, and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic at the President’s decision to task him to lead this vitally important agency and our national budget.\nHe quickly established himself in the Congress, as I saw firsthand, as one of the leading fiscal experts on Capitol Hill.  He work on the House committees on financial services, oversight, and government reform only added to that sterling reputation.  A happy warrior on behalf of fiscal responsibility, Mick Mulvaney will bring those very same qualities to the Office of Management and Budget.\nMick, President Trump has asked you to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a vital role in a day and age of deficits and debt.  And we're both very confident that your leadership, your integrity, and your commitment to protecting America’s fiscal and economic future will serve all the people of the United States with great distinction.\nThank you for stepping up at this time in the life of our nation.  And behalf of President Trump, it now is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.)  (Applause.)\nEND\n6:47 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We had an exciting news conference before.  And some people loved it.  I think nobody hated it, but it was -- I think it was very productive.  And thank you all for being there, that was very nice.  And thank you, all of the wonderful politicians, but -- right, Mitch, especially the miners that are with us, right?  So I just want to thank you.  Seriously.  (Applause.)  We appreciate it.  We appreciate it very much.\nAnd this is our second bill signing this week as we continue to work for the American people.  This is H.J. Resolution 38, and that will eliminate another terrible job-killing rule, saving many thousands of American jobs, especially in the mines, which I’ve been promising you.  The mines are a big deal.  I’ve had support from some of you folks right from the very beginning, and I won’t forget it.  I went to West Virginia and I -- we had 17,000, 18,000 people that couldn’t get into that big arena, right?  You were a few of them.  But that was some day and some night.\nI want to thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop -- thank you, Rob -- and Representative Bill Johnson, who worked very hard on this bill.  And they really did, they worked very hard.  This was a tough one.\nI also want to thank the great members of Congress who have joined us today.  We have a lot of them.  In eliminating this rule, I am continuing to keep my promise to the American people to get rid of wasteful regulations that do nothing -- absolutely nothing -- but slow down the economy, hamstring companies, push jobs to other countries -- which is happening all over, although I must tell you, we’ve stopped it.  You’ve seen all the factories, all the plants that are moving back.  They’re going back to a lot of places.  So you know that, right, fellas?  They’re moving back fast.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- so many.  Very happy.\nCompliance costs for this rule would be over $50 million a year for the coal industry alone, and it’s unnecessary.  I want to also thank the incredible coal miners who are with us today.  I think we can maybe thank them the most, right, for -- political leaders.  (Applause.)  You folks have put up with a lot.  And you know, in other countries, they love their coal.  Over here, we haven’t treated it with the respect it deserves.  Even for defense, having that coal is a very important thing for us.  So I want to thank you all.\nThis rule we’re eliminating it’s a major threat to your jobs, and we’re going to get rid of that threat immediately.  We’re going to fight for you like I promised I would in the campaign.  And you were very good to me, and I’m going to be even better to you, I promise you that.\nAnd we’re going to fight for, also, low-energy prices for all Americans.  There’s a spirit of optimism rising across the country.  It’s going to continue to grow as we sign more and more bills.  We’re going to make our nation more than competitive -- not just competitive, we’re going to be more than competitive.  And we’re going to win at many, many industries.  We’re already starting back with the automobile industry.  We had the airline industry in the other day.  They have rules and regulations that by the time they get through it, it’s -- nothing left, and they have to get rid of a lot of jobs.  We had a great meeting, actually.\nWe had the unions in.  We had the workers in.  We had a lot of people in, and they were all very excited about what’s happening.  And I haven’t looked yet at the stock market, but it’s been going up at record clips.  We have a tremendous streak going on.  And that’s only because of the optimism.  They feel the optimism.  And that optimism is creating a lot of jobs.\nSo it’s an honor to have everybody with us, and, in particular, the miners.  We appreciate everything you’ve done, fellas.  Thank you very much.\nWould anybody like to say a few words?  How about one of the miners saying a few words?  I hear these guys all the time.  I hear Rand all the time.  (Laughter.)  Come on.  Who’d like to -- come on, Mike.\nMR. NELSON:  President Trump, we thank you very much for everything you’ve done for us.  Everything that you’re doing for our industry is very much needed.  I’ve been mining in this industry for 40 years, and this is a very exciting time for our industry.  Thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.\nSENATOR MANCHIN:  Tell him where you’re from, Mike.\nMR. NELSON:  I’m from Morgantown, West Virginia, but I work at the Marion County Coal Company.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How did I do in that area?\nMR. NELSON:  Oh, you did great.  (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Good.  Say something.\nCONGRESSWOMAN CAPITO:  Well, President Trump --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’re a -- you represent.\nCONGRESSWOMAN CAPITO:  Yes.  Representing West Virginia as the Senator, and Senator Manchin and I, and we have our congressional delegation here -- Congressman Jenkins, Congressman McKinley, and Congressman Mooney.  This is a lifeline to us, and these miners, they mine in West Virginia.  It’s a source of pride for us as a state that we’ve been able to power this country, and that we’ve had the opportunity to provide the energy to this country.  And thank you for being a partner with us and being a leader, President Trump, in this.  We believe in this, and we believe in your commitment to making sure American miners get back to work.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nSENATOR PAUL:  This is a big day for Kentucky.  We want to thank President Trump for getting rid of this job-killing regulation.  It was scheduled to cost us thousands of more jobs.  Nobody seemed to care about Kentucky, but I can promise you, Eastern Kentucky voted about 75 percent for Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.)\nSENATOR MANCHIN:  Let me just say something very quickly.  There’s not a miner here that’s not an environmentalist.  So when people say that we don’t want to do the right thing -- there’s a balance between the environment and the economy, these miners would be the first ones to tell you.  They’re out in the woods, they’re hunting, they’re fishing, they’re doing everything possible.  All they want is the respect that -- basically they’ve given us the country we have because of the hard work of them and their fathers and grandfathers and all of their family has done.\nSo I’m so proud.  These are all West Virginians too.  Makes it even prouder for all of us.  So thank you.  God bless you.\nLEADER MCCONNELL:  Well, Mr. President, you know that the last eight years brought a depression -- a depression -- to Eastern Kentucky, and our folks are so excited to have a pro-coal President.  And we thank you so much for being on our side.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Anybody else?  Come on.  Sure.  Absolutely.  You deserve it.\nLEADER MCCONNELL:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You deserve it.  Come on up.\nPARTICIPANT:  Well, Mr. President, this is an example of what you talked about so much during your campaign.  This is what is going to make America great again.  This is the legislative branch and you working together to keep the promise that you made to put coal miners back to work and to save the coal industry.  If we had not overturned this rule, we were looking at nearly 70,000 jobs across the country, and about 80 percent of our coal reserves being unavailable.  So thank you for your willingness to work with us to get this done.  It’s very, very important to the coal miners of this country and to our electricity grid.  Thank you, Mr. President.  (Applause.)\nPARTICIPANT:  As a 45-year miner, I’m very proud to be in this historic building, and I am very proud to be here with my President of the United States, who keeps his word.  And we thank you very much, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s a great honor.  (Applause.)\nSo I want to thank everybody.  And tell your friends back in West Virginia and Kentucky and all the other places where we worked -- Wyoming --\nSENATOR HEITKAMP:  North Dakota.\nREPRESENTATIVE JORDAN:  Ohio.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  North Dakota.  Ohio.\nREPRESENTATIVE LAMBORN:  Colorado.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’re right about that.  They have been fantastic.  Everybody’s been -- actually, everybody’s been great, and we appreciate it very much.  Special people.  Special workers.  We’re bringing it back, and we’re bringing it back fast.  We didn’t have to wait a long period of time.  It’s been very few days since I’ve been here, and I think this is long ahead of schedule, right?  Wouldn’t you say even --\nSENATOR MANCHIN:  Absolutely.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Even you might say -- (laughter) -- this is about four years faster than they thought would have happened.  So it’s my honor.  And, fellas, go back to work, all right?  I think we’ll take them into the Oval Office, right?  Let’s take them into the Oval Office.  Let’s have a little tour, okay?  They’ve probably been there many times before.  (Laughter.)  Come on.  Come with me.  Good.\nThank you, everybody.  Thank you, very much.\nAIDE:  Sign the bill here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh.  (Laughter.) I could have gotten away with it.\nPARTICIPANT:  It’s the important part.\n(The President signs the bill.)\nEND\n3:53 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.  He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.  Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.  And he has had a tremendous career.  He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed -- did very, very well.  And so Alex, I've wished him the best.  We just spoke.  And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.\nAnd also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved -- weeks late, I have to say that.  Weeks, weeks late.  Office of Management and Budget.  And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.  Paul Singer has just left.  As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, \"Never Trump.\"  And Paul just left and he's given us his total support.  And it's all about unification.  We're unifying the party, and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country.  It's very important to me.  I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me.  So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.  He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.  And I appreciate that.\nI think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.  And I had this time -- we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.  Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.  And we've done some really good work.  We're very proud of that.\nAnd then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we'll do some questions -- unless you have no questions.  That's always a possibility.\nI'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.  We have made incredible progress.  I don’t think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.\nA new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it.  They actually get it, but they don’t write it -- let's put it that way.  But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.  The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.  And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.  It used to mean, oh, that's good.  Now it means that's good for jobs.  Very different.  Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.\nI'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible.  Maybe it's not, and that's okay too.\nUnfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.  The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people -- tremendous disservice.  We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control.  The level of dishonesty is out of control.\nI ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.  I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.  I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment.  As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic.  But much of it is not -- the distortion.  And we'll talk about it, and you'll be able to ask me questions about it.\nBut we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people.  As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.  To be honest, I inherited a mess -- it’s a mess -- at home and abroad.  A mess.  Jobs are pouring out of the country.  You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places -- low-pay, low-wages.  Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.  The Middle East, a disaster.  North Korea -- we’ll take care of it, folks.  We're going to take care of it all.  I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.\nBeginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.  On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders -- much of it you've covered -- to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.\nWe've had great conversations with the United Kingdom -- and meetings -- Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.  Really, really productive conversations.  I would say far more productive than you would understand.  We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.  It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.\nI have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis -- he’s over there now, working very hard -- to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.  It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.  They've spread like cancer.  ISIS has spread like cancer.  Another mess I inherited.\nAnd we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.  And they're the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.  And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.  And it’s not properly solved now.  It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.\nI’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.  I’ve had great support from the Senate.  I’ve had great support from Congress generally.  We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.  And I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it.  But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild.  We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment.  And their equipment is old.  I used it, I talked about it at every stop.  Depleted -- it’s depleted.  It won’t be depleted for long.\nAnd I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.  We have to have strong law enforcement also.  So we do not go abroad in the search of war.  We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.\nAt home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.  In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people.  These are campaign promises.  Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.  Well, that's what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half -- strong borders.  They're so surprised -- \"oh, you're having strong borders.\"  Well, that's what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.\nOne promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.  They lie to the American people in order to get elected.  Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.  And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.\nI’m here following through on what I pledged to do.  That's all I’m doing.  I put it out before the American people.  Got 306 Electoral College votes.  I wasn’t supposed to get 222.  They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.  Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.  We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before.  So that's the way it goes.  I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.\nIn other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.  But a lot of people are happy about it.  In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.\nI turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.  Chaos!  Yet, it is the exact opposite.  This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people.  Like Senator Dan Coates whose there -- one of the most respected men of the Senate -- he can’t get approved.  How do you not approve him?  He’s been a colleague, highly respected -- brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it -- but waiting for approval.\nSo we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.  So if the Democrats, who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now -- the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.\nLet me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.  I just got here.  I got here with no Cabinet.  Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.  So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.  We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals -- bilateral.  We’re going to have one-on-one deals.\nWe’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.  People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.  They go in for a permit -- it’s many, many years.  And then at the end of the process -- they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense -- and at the end of the process, they get rejected.  Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection.  It's not going to take years.  But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance.  We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.  We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.\nWe’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.  We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.  We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  Makes sense.  Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.  If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.  And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.  It’s very important to me.  But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.\nWe’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.  We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others -- taking place right now in our inner cities.  Horrible.  We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.  We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.  Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.\nWe’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.  Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process.  And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me.  The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government.  And we’re going to have a wall that works.  We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.\nWe’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.  No more release, no matter who you are -- release.  We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.  We are saving American lives every single day.  The court system has not made it easy for us.  And we've even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.\nWe’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.  Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe -- including reporters safe -- and is vigorously defending this lawful order.  I will not back down from defending our country.  I got elected on defense of our country.  And I keep my campaign promises.  And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.  They already are.  I can tell you that.\nExtreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.  In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.  I've heard 80 percent -- I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard -- that they're overturned 80 percent of the time.  I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.  But we are appealing that and we are going further.\nWe're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.  At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.\nWe've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thousands and thousands of jobs -- and put new \"Buy American\" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.  In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.  We want them to use American steel.  And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.  Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.  And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel?  And they said, that's a good idea.  We put it in.\nTo drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.  We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Obamacare is a disaster, folks.  It's a disaster.  You can say, oh, Obamacare -- I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.  So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.  We're bringing our jobs back to this country big league.  It's already happening, but big league.\nI've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.  You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years.  That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.  You look at Rex Tillerson -- he's out there negotiating right now.  General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.  We have great, great people.  Mick is with us now.  We have great people.\nAmong their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.  Now, look, fair trade -- not free -- fair.  If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore.  Every country takes advantage of us, almost.  I may be able to find a couple that don't.  But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.\nJobs have already started to surge.  Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.  Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.  They were with me a week ago.  You know -- you were here.  General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.  And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left.  And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.\nIntel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.  And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.  Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.  There will be many, many more.  Many more.  These are a few that we're naming.\nOther countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades and decades and decades, folks.  And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.  Not going to let it happen.\nAnd one more thing.  I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution -- highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats -- you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.  But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.\nThis last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.  Again, I say it -- there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.  And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.  Some very big things are going to be announced next week.\nSo we’re just getting started.  We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.  I hope to see you there.  And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.\nMara.  Mara, go ahead.  You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.\nQ    Did you fire Mike Flynn?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.  He respectfully gave it.  He is a man who -- there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.  And I was not happy with the way that information was given.\nHe didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.  What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.  That’s the real problem.  And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.  In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- they know nothing about it.  They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.  It’s all fake news.  It’s all fake news.\nThe nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara -- and I think it’s very important -- the illegal giving out classified information.  And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.  I’ll give you an example.  I called, as you know, Mexico.  It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.  And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s -- I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.  All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.  It’s supposed to be secret.  It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.  Same thing with Australia.  All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.\nThe same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.  Everybody saw this, and I’m saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?  How do they do it?  You know why?  Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.  But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.  Really ashamed.\nYes, go ahead.\nQ    Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong.  If anything, he did something right.  He was coming into office, he looked at the information.  He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do.  They’re supposed to be -- and he didn’t just call Russia.  He called and spoke to, both ways -- I think there were 30-some-odd countries.  He’s doing the job.\nYou know, he was just doing his job.  The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember.  So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me.  And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.\nBut he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember.  And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.\nYes.\nQ    President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here.  During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?  And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.  And it was very much discredited, as you know.  It was -- it’s a joke.  And the people mentioned in the story -- I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.  They weren’t even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part -- I hadn’t spoken to them.  I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him.  I don’t think I’ve ever met him.  And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.  I don’t think I ever met him.  Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.  I didn’t talk to him, ever.  And he thought it was a joke.\nThe other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.  Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.  And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia -- but knew that he represented various countries.  That's what he does.  I mean, people know that.  That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way -- who's, by the way, a respected man.  He’s a respected man.  But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.  But everybody -- people knew that.  Everybody knew that.  So these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.  And he said that very forcefully.  I saw his statement.  He said it very forcefully.  Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.\nSo the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.  And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.  I have no loans in Russia.  I don't have any deals in Russia.  President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.  He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.  But so did many other leaders -- almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.  So that's the extent.\nRussia is fake news.  Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media.  The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there -- because we have our new people going in place right now.  As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.  James Comey at FBI.  Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.  I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.  And he’s still waiting to be approved.  But our new people are going in.\nAnd just while you're at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday.  And it talked about -- you saw it, front page.  So, Director of National Intelligence just put out -- acting -- a statement:  “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” -- this was just given to us -- “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.”\nSo they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal -- top -- and they just wrote the story is not true.  And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest -- because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.  I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.  But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.  How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?  Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?  That was like that story they wrote about the women and me -- front page.  Big massive story.  And it was nasty.\nAnd then they called.  They said, \"We never said that.  We like Mr. Trump.\"  They called up my office -- we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.  And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you -- totally misrepresented.  I said, give us a retraction.  They never gave us a retraction.  And, frankly, I then went on to other things.\nGo ahead.\nQ    Mr. President --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You okay?\nQ    I am.  Just wanted to get untangled.  Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.  In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m talking about Republican.  Yes.\nQ    President Obama, 332.  George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President.  So why should Americans trust --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, no, I was told -- I was given that information.  I don't know.  I was just given.  We had a very, very big margin.\nQ    I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know.  I was given that information.  I was given -- actually, I’ve seen that information around.  But it was a very substantial victory.  Do you agree with that?\nQ    You're the President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you.  That's a good answer.  Yes.\nQ    Mr. President, thank you so much.  Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn -- there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?  Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?  What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?\nAnd further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We are.\nQ    Can we ask what you're doing to do?  And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.  What can you tell us about that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position.  So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.  The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.  And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of.  But I don't think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\nAs far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong.  My counsel came -- Don McGahn, White House Counsel -- and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.  He said he doesn't think anything is wrong.  He really didn't think -- it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong.  I didn't either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.  I said, well, I don't see -- to me, he was doing the job.\nThe information was provided by -- who I don't know -- Sally Yates -- and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.  But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.  As far as the actual making the call -- in fact, I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.  That was very normal.  At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.  After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.\nSo -- and I do -- and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.\nYes, Jon.\nQ    On the leaks, sir --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.\nQ    Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?  You have said twice today --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, we're looking at it very, very seriously.  I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.  Those are criminal leaks.  They're put out by people either in agencies.  I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in.  You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.  We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.  So we are looking into that very seriously.  It's a criminal act.\nYou know what I say -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.  Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.  When I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.  But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen.  But that wasn't that important to call, it was fine.  I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world -- the President who is a very fine man, by the way.  Same thing with Australia.  I said, that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important.  But then I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?  What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East?  Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information -- very important, very -- I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?\nSo I don't want classified information getting out to the public.  And in a way, that was almost a test.  So I'm dealing with Mexico.  I'm dealing with Argentina.  We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.  All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.  And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East?  What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?  We've got to stop it.  That's why it's a criminal penalty.\nYes, Jon.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.  Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?  And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the leaks are real.  You're the one that wrote about them and reported them.  I mean, the leaks are real.  You know what they said -- you saw it.  And the leaks are absolutely real.  The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.\nSo one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit -- than reporters, than good reporters.  It's very important to me, and especially in this position.  It's very important.  I don't mind bad stories.  I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true.  And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that.  But I'm not okay when it is fake.  I mean, I watch CNN -- it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.  I don't watch it anymore because it's very good -- he's saying no.  It's okay, Jim.  It's okay, Jim.  You’ll have your chance.  But I watch others too.  You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.\nBut I think it should be straight.  I think it should be -- I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.  I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be -- I think that it would actually be better.\nPeople -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.  I think that’s right.  I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?  Because you know, I think they have lower -- I heard, lower than Congress.\nBut honestly, the public would appreciate it.  I’d appreciate it.  Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.  But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.  I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.  I mean, the numbers are crazy.  When I’m looking -- some of them had them approved immediately.  I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.\nAnd that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.  And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.  The only thing they can do is delay.  And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.  And sometimes, I mean -- I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.  And that’s okay.  That’s fine.\nBut I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.  This is pure delay tactics.  And they say it, and everybody understands it.\nYeah, go ahead, Jim.\nQ    The first part of my question on contacts.  Do you definitively say that nobody --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I had nothing to do with it.  I have nothing to do with Russia.  I told you, I have no deals there.  I have no anything.\nNow, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give -- they’re not giving classified information.  They’re giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates -- which, by the way, nobody mentions.  Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.\nCan you imagine -- seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?  It would be the electric chair, okay?  “He should be put in the electric chair.”  You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?  Maybe not you, Jon.\nYes, we’ll do you next, Jim.  I’ll do you next.  Yes?\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to clarify one other thing.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\nQ    Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  No, I didn’t.\nQ    (Inaudible.)  (Off mic.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.\nQ    Did you fire him because (inaudible) --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me -- no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.  Mike was doing his job.  He was calling countries and his counterparts.  So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.  I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.  I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.\nAnd it came out that way -- and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.  And I agreed with him.  And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.\nNo, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?\nJim.\nQ    Mr. President, thank you very much.  And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.  If you could pass that along.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?\nQ    If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many.  We do have other people.  You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.\nQ    They're pretty good right now, actually.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Go ahead, Jim.\nQ    If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.  You welcomed that at one point.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I was okay with it.\nQ    You said you loved WikiLeaks.  At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.  I’m wondering, sir, if you --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.\nQ    Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.\nQ    If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, fair question.  Ready?\nQ    So if I may ask you that -- if I may ask a follow-up --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but are you -- let me do one at a time.  Do you mind?\nQ    Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All right.  So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.  In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.  I will say this:  If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.  He said terrible things about her.  But it wasn’t classified information.\nBut in one case you’re talking about classified.  Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.  I don’t want to be hacked.  And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.\nThe DNC did not do that.  And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.  But they were hacked, and terrible things came.  And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things, I said -- I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.  It wasn’t even in the papers.\nAgain, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.  I would have been the headline in every newspaper.\nI mean, think of it.  They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.  Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, \"I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job\"?\nQ    And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about -- you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.  I guess I don't understand.  It seems that there is a disconnect there.  If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the reporting is fake.  Look, look --\nQ    And if I may ask -- I just want to ask one other question.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Jim, you know what it is?  Here’s the thing.  The public isn’t -- they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.  They don't know if it’s true or false because they're not involved.  I’m involved.  I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.  But I’m involved.  So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.\nI just see many, many untruthful things.  And I tell you what else I see.  I see tone.  You know the word “tone.”  The tone is such hatred.  I’m really not a bad person, by the way.  No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.  The tone is such hatred.\nI watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say “Fox & Friends” in the morning, they're very honorable people.  They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.  But they have the most honest morning show.  That's all I can say.  It’s the most honest.  But the tone, Jim.  If you look -- the hatred.  I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets --\nQ    (Off mic.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.  You just take a look at that show.  That is a constant hit.  The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.  The good news is he doesn't have good ratings.  But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.  And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.\nNow, I will say this.  I watch it.  I see it.  I’m amazed by it.  And I just think you’d be a lot better off -- I honestly do.  The public gets it, you know.  Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.  They want to throw their placards at CNN.\nI think you would do much better by being different.  But you just take a look.  Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.  If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.\nNow, they’ll take this news conference.  I’m actually having a very good time, okay?  But they’ll take this news conference -- don't forget that's the way I won.  Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.\nQ    (Off mic.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, that's how I won.  I won with news conferences and probably speeches.  I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure.\nBut I am having a good time.  Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.  I’m not ranting and raving.  I’m just telling you, you're dishonest people.  But -- but I’m not ranting and raving.  I love this.  I’m having a good time doing it.  But tomorrow the headlines are going to be:  Donald Trump Rants and Raves.  I’m not ranting and raving.\nQ    If I may just --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.\nQ    One more follow-up because --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Should I let him have a little bit more?  What do you think, Peter?\nQ    Just because of this --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?  Sit down.  Sit down.\nQ    Just because of the attack --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll get it.\nQ    Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’m changing it from fake news, though.\nQ    Doesn't that undermine --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Very fake news now.  (Laughter.)\nQ    But aren’t you --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.\nQ    Real news, Mr. President.  Real news.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you're not related to our new --\nQ    I am not related, sir, no.  (Laughter.)  I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I looked -- you know, I looked at that name.  I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?  Alex Acosta.\nQ    I’m sure you checked that out, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I checked it.  I said -- they said, no, sir.  I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.\nQ    But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like “fake news”?  Why not just say it’s a story I don't like?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I do that.\nQ    When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I do that.  No, no, I do that.\nQ    -- in our news media.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Here’s the thing.\nQ    Isn’t that important?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, I understand -- and you're right about that except this.  See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.  And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.  I know what’s good and bad.  I’d be a pretty good reporter -- not as good as you.  But I know what’s good.  I know what’s bad.\nAnd when they change it and make it really bad -- something that should be positive.  Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.  They’ll even make it negative.  So I understand it because I’m there.  I know what was said.  I know who is saying it.  I’m there.  So it’s very important to me.\nLook, I want to see an honest press.  When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.  The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore.  Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know.  But they don't believe you.\nIf you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?  Of course, he had some questions also.  But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world -- including bad stories about me.  But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN -- I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.  I won.  I won.  And the other thing:  Chaos.  There’s zero chaos.  We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine.  And Reince happens to be doing a good job.  But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.\nI said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.  But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.  And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.  I mean, we won the election, right?  We won the presidency.  We got some senators.  We got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.\nAnd I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room -- I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.  They're fake.  They're not true.  And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care.  He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim.  I mean that.  I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.  I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody -- for whatever reason.  And I understand that.  But you've got to be at least a little bit fair.  And that's why the public sees it -- they see it.  They see it's not fair.  You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.  And the public is smart.  They understand it.\nOkay, yeah, go ahead.\nQ    We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).  But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news?  And secondly --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think they don't believe it.  I don't think the public would.  That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.  I don't think they believe it.  Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse.  That's a ruse.  And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.  Now, tomorrow you'll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.  It's not terrible -- it's good.\nWe had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.  We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.  You know what uranium is, right?  It's this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.  Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't do anything for Russia.  I've done nothing for Russia.  Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.  Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?  Here, take a look.  He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?  Hillary Clinton -- that was a reset.  Remember?  It said \"reset.\"\nNow, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy.  If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing.  We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.  And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me.  Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water.  Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great.  That's not great.  That's not great.  I would love to be able to get along with Russia.\nNow, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact.  Look where we are now.  Look where we are now.  So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things.  I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.  Maybe it is.  But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people -- the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.  And probably Putin said, you know -- he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story.  Okay?  And that's a shame.  Because if we could get along with Russia -- and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone -- if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.\nQ    Tax reform --\nQ    Mr. President, since you --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.  We're doing Obamacare -- we're in final stages.  We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.  And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.  It's not like -- frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.  So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.  And after that, we're going to come up -- and we're doing very well on tax reform.\nYes.\nQ    Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.  Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.\nQ    You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not good.\nQ    There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not good.\nQ    -- of the agreement between the two countries.  And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not good.\nQ    I listened to you during the campaign --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?  It happened when -- if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States.  There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the -- you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.  But I know you well enough.  Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that.  Look, of all --\nQ    I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Excuse me just one second.\nQ    I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal.  So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.  They all tried.  But I'm different than those people.\nGo ahead.\nQ    How are you interpreting those moves?  And what do you intend to do about them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Just the way I said it.\nQ    Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have.  I have.  And I'm so beautifully represented.  I'm so honored that the Senate approved him.  He's going to be fantastic.\nYes, I think that I've already --\nQ    Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I don't think so.  I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.  I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.  Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.\nNow, I don't know that we're going to make a deal.  I don't know.  We might, we might not.  But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better.  But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.  And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.\nIf Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.  There's no upside.  We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.  I've been briefed.  And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it:  Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.  They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.\nIf we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\nQ    So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who did I say is not good?\nQ    No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they're not good.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it's not good, but they happened.\nQ    But do they damage the relationship?  Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.  Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.  And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?  Does anybody in this room really believe that?  Okay.\nBut I tell you one thing:  She tried to make a deal.  She had the reset.  She gave all the valuable uranium away.  She did other things.  You know, they say I’m close to Russia.  Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.  She’s close to Russia.  I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia?  You know what I gave?  Nothing.\nQ    Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.  I don’t talk about military response.  I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.  \"We are going to attack Mosul in four months.\"  Then three months later:  \"We are going to attack Mosul in one month.\"  \"Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.\"  In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.  Do you know why?  Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.  You’re going to be surprised to hear that.  And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.  So I don’t have to tell you --\nQ    There will be a response?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.”  I don’t have to do that.\nQ    There will be a -- in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.  Wait a minute.  I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.  And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.  You know why?  Because they shouldn’t know.  And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.  So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship -- the Russian ship, as an example -- I’m not going to tell you.  But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.  But I’m not going to tell you.  Okay.\nQ    Thanks.\nQ    Can I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President -- the Trump --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where are you from?\nQ    BBC.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Here’s another beauty.\nQ    That’s a good line.  Impartial, free, and fair.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure.\nQ    Mr. President --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Just like CNN, right?\nQ    Mr. President, on the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth.  On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I do.  I do.   And let me tell you about the travel --\nQ    Were there any mistakes in that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait, wait, wait.  I know who you are.  Just wait.  Let me tell you about the travel ban.  We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.  We got a bad decision.  We had a court that’s been overturned -- again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.  A lot.  We had a bad decision.  We’re going to keep going with that decision.  We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.  But we had a bad decision.  That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.\nYou had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.  You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.  Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.  We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.  Very bad for the safety and security of our country.  The rollout was perfect.\nNow, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing -- and I said this to my people:  Give them a one-month period of time.  But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones.  You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?  They’re not everybody that’s like you.  You have some bad people out there.\nSo Kelly said, you can’t do that.  And he was right.  As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.  I said, how about one week?  He said, no good.  You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.  Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.\nNow, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.  The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.\nNow, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.  Very, very strongly.  But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.\nQ    Just a brief follow-up.  And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.\nQ    Thank you.  I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.  Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.  So that’s one person.  But he was dealing -- as he should have been --\nQ    During the election?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, nobody that I know of.\nQ    So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?\nQ    Can you just say yes or no on it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Russia is a ruse.  Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.  Russia is a ruse.  I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.  Don’t speak to people from Russia.  Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.  I spoke to Putin twice.  He called me on the election -- I told you this -- and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.  We had a very good talk, especially the second one -- lasted for a pretty long period of time.  I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.  But we had a very, very good talk.  I have nothing to do with Russia.  To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.\nNow, Manafort has totally denied it.  He denied it.  Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.  I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever.  But people knew that.  Everybody knew that.\nQ    But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have -- you know what, he said no.  I can only tell you what he -- now, he was replaced long before the election.  You know that, right?  He was replaced long before the election.  When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.  But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way -- Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.  He was only there for a short period of time.\nHow much longer should we stay here, folks?  Five more minutes, is that okay?  Five?\nQ    Mr. President, on national security --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait, let’s see, who’s -- I want to find a friendly reporter.  Are you a friendly reporter?  Watch how friendly he is.  Wait, wait -- watch how friendly he is.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.\nQ    So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.  And (inaudible).  I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.  We have an understanding of (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nQ    However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.  There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.  There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.  And it’s not.  It’s not.  Not a simple question, not a fair question.  Okay, sit down.  I understand the rest of your question.\nSo here’s the story, folks.  Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.  Number two, racism -- the least racist person.  In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Quiet, quiet, quiet.  See, he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.  So you know, welcome to the world of the media.  But let me just tell you something -- that I hate the charge.  I find it repulsive.  I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday -- did you hear him, Bibi?  He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.\nSo you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.\nYeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.\nQ    Thank you.  I’m Lisa from the PBS --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\nQ    On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?  Will it be focused on specific countries?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s a very fair question.\nQ    And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?  Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to show great heart.  DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.  To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases -- not in all cases.  In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.  But you have some absolutely incredible kids -- I would say mostly -- they were brought here in such a way -- it's a very, very tough subject.\nWe are going to deal with DACA with heart.  I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right.  And I appreciate your understanding on that.\nBut the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me.  Because, you know, I love these kids.  I love kids.  I have kids and grandkids.  And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.  And you know, the law is rough.  I'm not talking about new laws.  I'm talking the existing law is very rough.  It's very, very rough.\nAs far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.  But we're tailoring it now to the decision.  We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.  And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.  Okay?\nQ    Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.\nQ    And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.  Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?  And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Now, that's what I call a nice question.  That is very nice.  Who are you with?\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I'm going to start watching.  Thank you very much.\nMelania is terrific.  She was here last night.  We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.  And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.  And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.  And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.  That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center -- in other words, touring of the White House.\nShe, like others that she's working with, feels very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties, very, very strongly.  And she's a very, very strong advocate.  I think she's a great representative for this country.  And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.  The things they say -- I've known her for a long time.  She was a very successful person.  She was a very successful model.  She did really well.  She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people.  She was a very private person.  She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find.  And the things they say -- and I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair.  And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.\nI'd just tell you this:  I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady.  She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.  And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.  And they're not doing this for money.  They're not doing this for pay.  They're doing this because they feel it, both of them.  And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.  Thank you.  That's a very nice question.\nGo ahead.\nQ    Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that's okay.\nQ    No, it's not going to be a bad question.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.\nQ    Well, thank you so much.  Mr. President, I need to find out from you -- you said something as it relates to inner cities.  That was one of your platforms during your campaign.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fix the inner cities, yes.\nQ    Fixing the inner cities.  What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that's coming out this afternoon?  See, it wasn't bad, was it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That was very professional and very good.\nQ    I'm very professional.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself.  But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.  But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.\nAs far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.  I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.  We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.  And, by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.\nSo we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.  We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know it takes a long time.  It's taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.\nBut we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.  And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.  You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime.  You have people -- and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it.  In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.  They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.  They’re living in hell.  We can’t let that happen.  So we’re going to be very, very strong.\nIt’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.  It’s been festering for many, many years.  But we have places in this country that we have to fix.  We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there -- Hispanic American people.  We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell.\nI mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.  There are two Chicagos, as you know.  There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.  There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.  So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.  I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.\nQ    Well, when you say -- when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Am I going include who?\nQ    Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I would.  I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?  Do you want to set up the meeting?\nQ    No, no, no.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Are they friends of yours?\nQ    I’m just a reporter.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, go ahead, set up the meeting.\nQ    I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Let’s go set up a meeting.  I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.  I think it’s great -- the Congressional Black Caucus.  I think it’s great.  I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting.  I was all set to have the meeting.  You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.  I spoke to him on the phone.  Very nice guy.\nQ    I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He wanted it.  But we called, called, called, called -- they can’t make a meeting with him.  Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.  Because I do want to solve the problem.  But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that -- some other lightweight -- he was probably told -- he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.  And that’s part of the problem of this country.\nOkay, one more.  Go ahead.\nQ    Yes, Mr. President, two questions --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  One question.  Two, we can’t handle.  This room can’t handle two.  Go ahead, give me the better of your two.\nQ    (Inaudible) it's not about your personality or your beliefs.  We’re talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.  What do you --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And some of it -- and can I be honest with you?  And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.  Some of it written by our opponents.  You do know that.  Do you understand that?  You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.  Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.  No.  But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.  They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.  It won’t be my people.  It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.  Okay.\nGo ahead.\nQ    You are the President now.  What are you going to do about it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who is that?  Where is that?  Oh, stand up.  You can --\nQ    What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’m working on it.  No, I’m working on it very hard.\nQ    Are you going to give a speech?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, look.  Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.  Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.  I didn’t come along and divide this country.  This country was seriously divided before I got here.\nWe’re going to work on it very hard.  One of the questions that was asked -- I thought it was a very good question -- was about the inner cities.  I mean, that’s part of it.  But we’re going to work on education.  We’re going to work on lack -- you know, we’re going to stop -- we’re going to try and stop the crime.  We have great law enforcement officials.  We’re going to try and stop crime.  We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime.\nBut it’s very important to me.  But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.  We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama.  We lived in a divided nation.  And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that.\nI want to thank everybody very much.  It’s a great honor to be with you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nEND\n2:13 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all for being here.  I had a lot of good discussions this morning.  I'm negotiating a lot of contracts that are saving billions and billions of dollars for the American people and for all of us, and I'm very proud of it.\nYou know, the F-35 fighter jet, the Air Force One program, which was totally out of control and now it's back where it's supposed to go, and many other things.  In addition, I had a very good phone call this morning about a major plant that's moving back into the United States.  We'll be talking about it soon.\nAnd what I do have is a little free time at about 12 o'clock.  So I don't think the press will want to show up, but I think I'll have a press conference probably at 12 o'clock in the East Room.  We had a little time in between things.  So if the press would like to show up -- will anybody show up to that press conference?  (Laughter.)  Historically, they didn't care about these things.  For me, they show up.  So I think 12 o'clock in the East Room of the White House we'll have a press conference.\nI just want to thank you folks for coming today.  This was good.  This was scheduled a long time ago -- some of my very, very early supporters.  And I've been your supporter also.  We're doing really well.  The fake-news media doesn't like talking about the economy; I never see anything about the stock market sets new records every day.  I never see it.  But I think the people understand it.\nWe're giving a speech in Melbourne, Florida on Saturday.  I think it's going to be around 4 o'clock.  and I hear the tickets, you can't get them, but that's okay.  It's better than you have too many, right?

EST\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today I have the honor of welcoming my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House.  With this visit, the United States again reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our cherished ally, Israel.  The partnership between our two countries built on our shared values has advanced the cause of human freedom, dignity and peace.  These are the building blocks of democracy.\nThe state of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression -- I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone -- and of survival in the face of genocide.  We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured.\nYour perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds is truly inspirational.  The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about.  One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal.  My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing -- I mean ever -- a nuclear weapon.\nOur security assistance to Israel is currently at an all-time high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many.  Both of our countries will continue and grow.  We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life.  America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life.\nThis is one more reason why I reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations -- just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly -- or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel.  Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability.  That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal.  We'll be working on it very, very diligently.  Very important to me also -- something we want to do.  But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement.  We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them.\nAs with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises.  You know that, right?  (Laughter.)\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Both sides.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism.  As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts.  Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten.\nThose are the ideals to which we all, and will always, aspire and commit.  This will be the first of many productive meetings.  And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  President Trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and Melania have shown me, my wife Sara, our entire delegation.  I deeply value your friendship.  To me, to the state of Israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke -- Israel has no better ally than the United States.  And I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel.\nOur alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership I’m confident it will get even stronger.  I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field -- in security, in technology, in cyber and trade, and so many others.  And I certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that Israel is treated fairly in international forums, and that the slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the United States of America.\nAs you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests.  And, increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force:  radical Islamic terror.  Mr. President, you’ve shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head-on.  You call for confronting Iran’s terrorist regime, preventing Iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal.  And you have said that the United States is committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  You call for the defeat of ISIS.  Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam.  And in this great task, as in so many others, Israel stands with you and I stand with you.\nMr. President, in rolling back militant Islam, we can seize an historic opportunity -- because, for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, Arab countries in the region do not see Israel as an enemy, but, increasingly, as an ally.  And I believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace.\nLet us seize this moment together.  Let us bolster security.  Let us seek new avenues of peace.  And let us bring the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States to even greater heights.\nThank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Again, thank you.\nWe’ll take a couple of questions.  David Brody, Christian Broadcasting.  David.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister.  Both of you have criticized the Iran nuclear deal, and at times even called for its repeal.  I’m wondering if you’re concerned at all as it relates to not just the National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in Russia -- if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep Iran from becoming a nuclear state.\nAnd secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page?  How do you exactly term that as it relates to the settlement issue?  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man.  I think he’s been treated very, very unfairly by the media -- as I call it, the fake media, in many cases.  And I think it’s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.  I think, in addition to that, from intelligence -- papers are being leaked, things are being leaked.  It’s criminal actions, criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time -- before me.  But now it’s really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.\nI think it’s very, very unfair what’s happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally -- I stress that -- illegally leaked.  Very, very unfair.\nAs far as settlements, I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit.  We’ll work something out.  But I would like to see a deal be made.  I think a deal will be made.  I know that every President would like to.  Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible.  And it wasn’t possible because they didn't do it.\nBut Bibi and I have known each other a long time -- a smart man, great negotiator.  And I think we're going to make a deal.  It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand.  That's a possibility.  So let’s see what we do.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Let’s try it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Doesn't sound too optimistic, but -- (laughter) -- he’s a good negotiator.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  That's the “art of the deal.”  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I also want to thank -- I also want to thank -- Sara, could you please stand up?  You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania.  I appreciate it very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nYour turn.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Yes, please.  Go ahead.\nQ    Thank you very much.  Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration?  And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank and unrestricted settlement constructions?  And one more question:  Are you going to fulfill your promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem?  And if so, when?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, did you come here tonight to tell the President that you're backing off the two-state solution?\nThank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.  (Laughter.)  I’m very happy with the one that both parties like.  I can live with either one.\nI thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two.  But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians -- if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best.\nAs far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, I’d love to see that happen.  We're looking at it very, very strongly.  We're looking at it with great care -- great care, believe me.  And we’ll see what happens.  Okay?\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Thank you.  I read yesterday that an American official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, you’d get eight different answers.  Mr. President, if you ask five Israelis, you’d get 12 different answers.  (Laughter.)\nBut rather than deal with labels, I want to deal with substance.  It’s something I’ve hoped to do for years in a world that's absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance.  So here’s the substance:  There are two prerequisites for peace that I laid out two years -- several years ago, and they haven’t changed.\nFirst, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state.  They have to stop calling for Israel’s destruction.  They have to stop educating their people for Israel’s destruction.\nSecond, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.  Because if we don't, we know what will happen -- because otherwise we’ll get another radical Islamic terrorist state in the Palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the Middle East.\nNow, unfortunately, the Palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace.  First, they continue to call for Israel’s destruction -- inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks.  You have to read it to believe it.\nThey even deny, Mr. President, our historical connection to our homeland.  And I suppose you have to ask yourself:  Why do - - why are Jews called Jews?  Well, the Chinese are called Chinese because they come from China.  The Japanese are called Japanese because they come from Japan.  Well, Jews are called Jews because they come from Judea.  This is our ancestral homeland.  Jews are not foreign colonialists in Judea.\nSo, unfortunately, the Palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present.  They name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered Israelis, and I have to say also murdered Americans.  They fund -- they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed Taylor Force, a wonderful young American, a West Point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting Israel.\nSo this is the source of the conflict -- the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any boundary; this persistent rejection.  That's the reason we don't have peace.  Now, that has to change.  I want it to change.  Not only have I not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they've become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the Middle East and has also, unfortunately, infected Palestinian society.\nSo I want this to change.  I want those two prerequisites of peace -- substance, not labels -- I want them reinstated.  But if anyone believes that I, as Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a Palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they're gravely mistaken.\nThe two prerequisites of peace -- recognition of the Jewish state, and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan -- they remain pertinent.  We have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward.  And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.\nAnd I greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, Mr. President, because I think that if we work together, we have a shot.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before.  And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense.  It would take in many, many countries and it would cover a very large territory.  So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's -- now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this.  So we'll see how that works out.\nKatie from Townhall.  Where's Katie?  Right there.  Katie.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal.  You've mentioned a halt on settlements.  Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months but the past couple of years as well?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  It's actually an interesting question.  I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard, it's hard to do.  They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal.  I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with.  And I think they'll do that.\nI think they very much would like to make a deal or I wouldn't be happy and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am.  I really think they -- I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal.\nI think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age.  They're taught tremendous hate.  I've seen what they're taught.  And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age and it starts in the school room.  And they have to acknowledge Israel -- they're going to have to do that.  There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country.  And I think they're going to be willing to do that also.  But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done.\nOkay?  Thank you.  Very interesting question.  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  You asked about Iran.  One thing is preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons -- something that President Trump and I think are deeply committed to do.  And we are obviously going to discuss that.\nI think, beyond that, President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency.  He pointed out there are violations, Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests.  By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, \"Israel must be destroyed.\"  The Palestinian -- rather the Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country.  No.  They write on the missile in Hebrew, \"Israel must be destroyed.\"\nSo challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on Hezbollah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond -- I think that's a change that is clearly evident since President Trump took office.  I welcome that.  I think it's -- let me say this very openly:  I think it's long overdue, and I think that if we work together -- and not just the United States and Israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the Iranian threat, then I think we can roll back Iran's aggression and danger.  And that's something that is important for Israel, the Arab states, but I think it's vitally important for America.  These guys are developing ICBMs.  They're developing -- they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs.  And they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on Earth, and including, and especially, eventually, the United States.\nSo this is something that is important for all of us.  I welcome the change, and I intend to work with President Trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Great.  Do you have somebody?\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Moav (ph)?\nQ    Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we’ve seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States.  And I wonder what you say to those among the Jewish community in the States, and in Israel, and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones.\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to what the President just said about the need for Israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the West Bank?  And a quick follow-up on my friend’s questions -- simple question:  Do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in Bar-Ilan speech, or you still support it?  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had -- 306 Electoral College votes.  We were not supposed to crack 220.  You know that, right?  There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270.  And there’s tremendous enthusiasm out there.\nI will say that we are going to have peace in this country.  We are going to stop crime in this country.  We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that’s going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time.\nI think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation.  Very divided.  And, hopefully, I’ll be able to do something about that.  And, you know, it was something that was very important to me.\nAs far as people -- Jewish people -- so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren.  I think that you’re going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four, or eight years.  I think a lot of good things are happening, and you’re going to see a lot of love.  You’re going to see a lot of love.  Okay?  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict.  I think it’s an issue, it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations.  And I think we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so we can arrive at an understanding so we don’t keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue.  And we’re going to discuss this.\nOn the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that I said.  It’s the label.  What does Abu Mazen mean by two states, okay?  What does he mean?  A state that doesn’t recognize the Jewish state?  A state that basically is open for attack against Israel?  What are we talking about?  Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran?\nSo obviously it means different things.  I told you what are the conditions that I believe are necessary for an agreement:  It’s the recognition of the Jewish state and it's Israel’s -- Israel’s -- security control of the entire area.  Otherwise we’re just fantasizing.  Otherwise we’ll get another failed state, another terrorist Islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope -- any hope -- for a peaceful future for our people.\nSo I’ve been very clear about those conditions, and they haven’t changed.  I haven’t changed.  If you read what I said eight years ago, it’s exactly that.  And I repeated that again, and again, and again.  If you want to deal with labels, deal with labels.  I’ll deal with substance.\nAnd finally, if I can respond to something that I know from personal experience.  I’ve known President Trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people -- his team, some of whom I’ve known for many years, too.  Can I reveal, Jared, how long we’ve known you?  (Laughter.)  Well, he was never small.  He was always big.  He was always tall.\nBut I’ve known the President and I’ve known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump.  I think we should put that to rest.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  I appreciate that very much.\nPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Thank you.\nEND\n12:42 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So it's nice to see we have some great retailers here today and we're going to go around the room and we'll all introduce ourselves.  Some of you I've read about on the covers of business magazines and it's great to have you here.  Thank you very much.\nI'm pleased to host all of you at the White House.  The CEOs -- you're some of the great CEOs of our country and the biggest in the retail industry, which is very important to the country in supporting millions and millions of jobs -- really one of the great job producers.  Probably, would you say, almost number one?  Pretty close, right?\nMR. KUSHNER:  I agree.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It is number one.\nThere's a lot of confidence in our economy right now.  There's a great confidence level.  You've been seeing that in the stock market.  You've been seeing that in businesses.  And you've been seeing that at every chart that's taken.  There's evidence also by the jobs report that just came out for January -- 227,000 jobs added.  My administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth -- that's what we're all about.  We have a lot of plants moving back into various states, including the state of Ohio, the state of Michigan, Pennsylvania.  You have a lot of companies moving back in, coming back into the country, bringing the jobs with them.\nWe're cutting regulations big league.  We are really cutting them by massive amounts.  The auto industry just left a week ago -- they were here in the same room -- and they are very happy with what we're doing and everyone is.  I think just about every -- the financial industry.  We're having a lot of the different industries in and we're cutting regulations in just about every industry.  In fact, I can't think of any that we're not.  If I do, we have a major story, okay, because I think just every industry we're cutting, some more than others.  You have a very, very big regulatory problem and we're going to take care of that because I want more jobs.  We're doing that because we want more jobs.\nAs you know, the overregulation costs our economy an estimated $2 trillion a year, which is incredible -- $2 trillion -- and it costs your businesses a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money and time.  I've taken executive action to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction by creating one and one.  So basically, for every one regulation, two are out.  So we knock out two.  So we put in one, but to put in one, you have to knock out two.  That's the least of it, but it's an important symbol.\nIn addition to reducing government regulations, we'll also reform our tax code to help middle-income families and American businesses grow and thrive.  Tax reform is one of the best opportunities to really impact our economy.  So we're doing a massive tax plan.  It's coming along really well.  It will be submitted in the not-too-distant future, and it will be not only good and simpler; it will be -- you're talking about big numbers of savings.  And we're talking also middle income and very much for business.  And the business is for middle income because you can employ a lot of people.  So we hope you're going to do that.\nWe're going to provide tax relief for families.  We're going to simplify very greatly the tax code -- it's too complicated.  We're going to bring down the number of alternatives, and I think it's going to be just a much, much simpler tax code.  In fact, H&R Block probably won't be too happy -- that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.  Other than H&R Block, I think people are going to love it.\nWe're going to lower the rates very, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category, including personal and business.  And I just want to go around the room.  I'd like you to introduce yourself and then I'll tell you a little bit more, and you're going to tell me what you're looking for.  But we want jobs.  We want jobs brought back to the country.  We want them brought back fast.  We want you to expand your stores.  And you'll tell me why you will or why you won't.  And tell me why you won't -- we'll work on you a little bit, right, Vice President Mike Pence?  (Laughter.)\nSo go ahead.\nMS. SOLTAU:  I'm Jill Soltau.  I'm with JoAnn Fabric and Craft Stores.\nMR. PECK:  Art Peck with The Gap.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Very good.\nMR. JOLY:  Hubert Joly with Best Buy.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Great store.\nMR. RHODES:  I'm Bill Rhodes with AutoZone.\nMR.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I am delighted to welcome everybody to the White House.  And Betsy DeVos, who has gone through -- our new Education Secretary -- she went through an interesting moment.  And you're going to do a fantastic job, and I know you would have done it again if you had to do it again, right?  (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY DEVOS:  Probably.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  She had no doubt that final night, waiting for the vote.  So I just want to congratulate you.  You showed toughness and genius.\nAs I said many times in my campaign, we want every child in America to have the opportunity to climb the ladder to success.  I want every child also to have a safe community, and we're going to do that very much.  We're going to be helping you a lot -- a great school and some day to get a really well-paying job or better, or better; own their own company.  And a lot of people are looking at that.\nBut it all begins with education, and that's why we're here this morning.  And I'm here also to celebrate a little bit with Betsy because we started this journey a long time ago, having to do with change and so many other good things with education.  And I'm so happy that that all worked out.\nRight now, too many of our children don't have the opportunity to get that education that we all talk about.  Millions of poor, disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools and this crisis -- and it really is a crisis -- of education and communities working together but not working out.  And we're going to change it around, especially for the African American communities.  It's been very, very tough and unfair.  And I know that's a priority and it's a certainly a priority of mine.\nThat's why I want every single disadvantaged child in America, no matter what their background or where they live, to have a choice about where they go to school.  And it's worked out so well in some communities where it's been properly run and properly done.  And it's a terrific thing.\nCharter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results.  And you look at the results -- we have cases in New York City that have been amazing in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of so many different schools that I can name throughout the country that I got to see during the campaign.  I went to one in Las Vegas; it was the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.  And they've done a fantastic job.\nSo there are many such schools and we want to do that on a large-scale basis.  We can never lose sight of the connection between education and jobs.  I'm bringing a lot of jobs back.  We're bringing a lot of big plants back into the country -- everyone said it was impossible.  And before I even took office, we started the process and tremendous numbers of plants are coming back into this country -- car plants and other plants.  And I have meetings next week with four or five different companies, big ones that are going to bring massive numbers of jobs back.\nSo we're doing it from the jobs standpoint, but education only makes it better.  Our goal is a clear and very safe community, great schools, and we want those jobs that are high-paying jobs -- we've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and we're going to bring them back.\nSo I’m going to do my job, and Betsy, at the education level, will do her job.  And just to do it very, very formally, I want to congratulate you on having gone through a very tough trial and a very unfair trial, and you won.  And there’s something very nice about that.  And I’ll tell you the real winner will be the children -- I guess a couple of adults (inaudible) -- but will be the children of this country.  And I just want to congratulate you.\nSECRETARY DEVOS:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Perhaps we’ll go around the room.  And everybody knows our fantastic Vice President, Mike Pence.  But if we went around the room, it would be very nice.  So why don’t we start?  Betsy, you might want to say a few words to us.\nSECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I am just very honored to have the opportunity to serve America’s students, and I’m really excited to be here today with parents and educators representing traditional public schools, charter public schools, homeschools, private schools, a range of choices.  And we’re eager to listen and learn from you your ideas for how we can ensure that all of our kids have an equal opportunity for a high-quality, great education and therefore an opportunity for the future.\nSo again, I just wanted to have the opportunity to serve, and looking forward to fulfilling the mission that you set forward.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s our honor -- believe me, Betsy.\nKenneth.\nMR. SMITH:  Ken Smith, educator helping at-risk kids get through school.  Vice President, it actually has the largest application of jobs for America’s graduates in the country.  And in a minute we’ll talk about that as a solution.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Good.\nLaura.\nMS. PARRISH:  Laura Parrish, I’m from Falls Church, Virginia.  I homeschool my 10- and my 13-year-old.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Very good.\nMary.\nMS. RINER:  My name is Mary.  I’m a charter school parent here in D.C., and considered the best school in America.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You think, huh?  (Laughter.)\nMS. RINER:  I know.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I like that.\nMS. RINER:  According to U.S. News & World Report.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Really?  Is that right?  Wow.\nJennifer.\nMS. COLEMAN:  I am Jennifer Coleman.  I am from Prince William County, Virginia.  I am the mother of six, and I homeschool my oldest four; they are grades kindergarten through seven.  And before that I was a private school teacher.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Very good.\nMR. CIRENZA:  Bartholomew Cirenza.  I’m a parent of seven, and my kids have gone through both private and public school, and I see differences, and --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Big difference.\nMR. CIRENZA:  Big difference.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.\nMS. BAUMANN:  Good morning, I’m Julie.  I teach special education at a public school in New Jersey.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you.\nMS. QUENNVILLE:  Hi, I’m Jane Quennville, and I’m a principal of a special-ed center in Virginia serving children ages five through twenty-two with autism and physical and medically fragile conditions.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How is that going?\nMS. QUENNVILLE:  Well --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Have you seen an increase in the autism with the children?\nMS. QUENNVILLE:  Yes, yes.  In fact, our school has shifted its population -- saw more children with autism, definitely.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So what’s going on with autism?  When you look at the tremendous increases, really, it’s such an incredible -- it’s like really a horrible thing to watch, the tremendous amount of increase.  Do you have any idea?  And you’re seeing it in the school?\nMS. QUENNVILLE:  Yes, I think -- I mean, I think the statistics, I believe, are 1 in 66, 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And now it’s going to be even lower --\nMS. QUENNVILLE:  Probably.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  -- which is just amazing.  Well, maybe we can do something.\nMS. BONILLA:  I am Carol Bonilla.  I teach Spanish in a private elementary school in Arlington.  I teach the students in fourth through eighth grade.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you.\nMS. VIANA:  Good morning, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President.  My name is Aimee Viana.  I’m the parent of two children -- fifth grade and second grade -- and I live right outside of Raleigh, North Carolina in Cary, and I’m also a former educator in public and private schools.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.  Thank you.  So thank you all very much.  Let’s get going.\nEND\n10:58 P.M.

EST\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Prime Minister Trudeau, on behalf of all Americans, I thank you for being with us today.  It is my honor to host such a great friend, neighbor, and ally at the White House, a very special place.  This year, Canada celebrates the 150th year of Confederation.  For Americans, this is one of the many milestones in our friendship, and we look forward -- very much forward, I must say -- to many more to come.\nOur two nations share much more than a border.  We share the same values.  We share the love, and a truly great love, of freedom.  And we share a collective defense.  American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together -- which we have.\nIn these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance.  The United States is deeply grateful for Canada’s contribution to the counter-ISIS effort.  Thank you.  And we continue to work in common, and in common cause, against terrorism, and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth.\nWe understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce.  Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada.  We should coordinate closely -- and we will coordinate closely -- to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe.\nPrime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests.  This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada.  It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration.  And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.\nAmerica is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada.  We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges, and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce.  Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people.\nWe just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else.  We know that.  I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused and you're focused on the important role women play in our economies.  We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and, very importantly, access to networks.\nIn our discussion today we will focus on improving the ways our government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada, and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world.\nMr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with you to build upon our very historic friendship.  There are incredible possibilities for us to pursue, Canada and the United States together.\nAgain, thank you for joining us, and I know our discussions will be very, very productive for the future of both countries.\nMr. Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you very much for joining us.\nI'd first like to start by extending my sincere thanks to President Trump for inviting me down to Washington.  Any day I get to visit our southern neighbors is a good day in my book, particularly when it's so nice and warm compared to what it is back home.  We are suffering under a significant winter storm that's hitting our Atlantic provinces particularly harsh, so I just want to send everyone back at home my thoughts as they shovel out, and impress on everyone to stay safe.\n(As interpreted from French.)  The President and myself have had a very productive first meeting today.  We had the opportunity to get to know one another better, and, more importantly, we had the opportunity to talk about the unique relationship between Canada and the United States.\n(In English.)  Ends on both sides of the 49th parallel have understood that the bond between our nations is a special one.  No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are.  We've fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together, including 1991's historic Air Quality Agreement.  And we've entered into groundbreaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples.\nCanadians and Americans alike share a common history as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated.  Our workers are connected by trade, transportation and cross-border commerce.  Our communities rely on each other for security, stability and economic prosperity.  Our families have long lived together and worked together.  We know that, more often than not, our victories are shared.  And just as we celebrate together, so too do we suffer loss and heartbreak together.\nThrough it all, the foundational pillar upon which our relationship is built is one of mutual respect.  And that's a good thing, because as we know, relationships between neighbors are pretty complex and we won't always agree on everything.  But because of our deep, abiding respect for one another, we're able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends.  Make no mistake -- at the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other's most essential partner.\nAnd today's conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both Canadians and Americans.  As we know, 35 U.S. states list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day.  Millions of good, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership.  Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.\n(As interpreted from French.)  As we know, 35 U.S. states list Canada as their largest export market and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day.  Millions of good, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership.  Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we’re going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.\n(In English.)  I'd like to highlight just a few of the specifics that President Trump and I discussed today.  At the end of the day, the President and I share a common goal.  We both want to make sure that hardworking folks can go to work at a good job, put food on the table for their families, and save up to take a vacation every once in a while.  That’s what we’re trying to do here.\nToday, we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment.  And, as we know, investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need.\nIn that same vein, we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining American and Canadian competitiveness on the world stage.  As such, the President and I have agreed to the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.  This initiative is more than just about dollars and cents.  This is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men, and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs.  In doing so, we’ll grow the Canadian and American economies, and help our businesses prosper.\n(As interpreted from French.)  Finally, President Trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border.  The rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy.  We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of Canadians and Americans.\nLadies and gentlemen, President Trump:  I know that if our countries continue to work together, our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation.\n(In English.)  History has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues, both foreign and domestic, we must work with our closest allies, learn from each other, and stand in solidarity as a united voice.\nWith a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage, Canada and the United States will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors.  Winston Churchill once said, “That long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country, and a pattern for the future of the world.”  That, my friends, is the very essence of the Canada-U.S. relationship.\nI look forward to working with President Trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership.  Once again, it’s a tremendous pleasure to be here in Washington.  Merci beaucoup.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, we’ll take a couple of questions.  Scott Thuman.  Scott.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  You just spoke about the desire to build bridges, although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau.  I’m curious, as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism, how do you see this relationship playing out?  And are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigration?\nAnd, Prime Minister Trudeau, while only in its infancy so far, how do you see this relationship compared to that under the Obama administration?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we just began discussions.  We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before.  We have some wonderful ideas on immigration.  We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism.  And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly -- we have a group of very talented people -- we will see some very, very obvious results.  We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade.\nWe have -- through technology, we have some really great ideas, and they’ll be implemented fairly quickly.\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  One of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together.  And certainly Canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have.  And we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly that.\nThere’s plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal, which is to create free, open societies that keep our citizens safe.  And that's certainly something that we're very much in agreement on.\nTonda MacCharles.\nQ    Good afternoon, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister.  And, Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer in English and French for us, please?\nA little bit of a follow-on on my American colleague’s question.  President Trump, you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the Prime Minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms.  So I’d like to know, are you confident the northern border is secure?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You can never be totally confident.  But through the incredible efforts -- already I see it happening -- of formerly General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, we have really done a great job.  We're actually taking people that are criminals -- very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems -- and we're getting them out.  And that's what I said I would do.  I’m just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large Electoral College vote.\nAnd I knew that was going to happen.  I knew this is what people were wanting.  And that wasn’t the only reason, that wasn’t my only thing that we did so well on.  But that was something was very important.  And I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members.  We're getting them out.\nGeneral Kelly, who is sitting right here, is doing a fantastic job.  And I said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones -- the really bad ones, we're getting them out.  And that's exactly what we're doing.\nI think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy.  And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now.\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Canada has always understood that keeping Canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government.  And that's certainly something that we're very much focused on.\nAt the same time, we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration, refugees, without compromising security.  And part of the reason we have been successful in doing that over the past year -- welcoming close to 40,000 Syrian refugees -- is because we have been coordinating with our allies, the United States and around the world, to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us.  And that's something that we continue to deal with.\n(As interpreted from French.)  It is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society, you have to make sure that you maintain -- that you focus on security.  And we have welcomed refugees from Syria.  We have been very successful, but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously.  And our allies, including the United States, understand this focus very well.  And they have done so since the very beginning.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:   Caitlin Collins (ph), please.\nQ    Thank you.  President Trump, now that you've been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly one month, what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us?\nAnd, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees.  Do you believe that President Trump’s moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Thank you.  Many, many problems.  When I was campaigning, I said it’s not a good situation.  Now that I see it -- including with our intelligence briefings -- we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here.\nObviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly.  We have problems all over the Middle East.  We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look.  I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well -- extended weekend, really.  We were with each other for long periods of time, and our staffs and representatives.\nBut on the home front, we have to create borders.  We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that.  We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country.  But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration.  And people -- citizens of our country want that, and that's their attitude, too.\nI will tell you, we are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense -- maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense -- and we are going to pursue it vigorously.  And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here but all over the world.  We won't stand for it.  We won't put up with it.  We're just not going to let it happen.  We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States.  And they will go well.  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Canada and the United States have been neighbors a long time, and Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together at home and around the world.  We've fought and died together in battlefields in World War I and World War II, in Korea, in Afghanistan.  But there have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that's always been done firmly and respectfully.\nThe last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves.  My role and our responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians' approach and be a positive example in the world.\nRichard Latendresse.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  I'll ask my question in French first and then, for you, I'll -- again in English.\n(As interpreted from French.)  Mr. Prime Minister, if I heard you correctly, you said that Canadian businesses, Canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA.  So what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of NAFTA?\n(In English.)  Mr. President, again, during the last three months, you have denounced NAFTA.  You have talked over and over about the Mexican portion of the agreement, very little about the Canadian one.  My question is in two short part is, is Canada a fair trader?  And when you talk about changes to NAFTA concerning Canada, are you talking about big changes or small changes?  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  (As interpreted.)  First of all, Richard, thank you for your question.  It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds, our relationship with the United States.  Goods and services do cross the border each way every single day, and this means a lot of millions of jobs for Canadians, and good jobs for Canadians.  So we are always focusing on these jobs, but there are also good jobs, millions of jobs, in the United States that depend on those relationships between our two countries.\nSo when we sit down as we did today, and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come, we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border.  And during this exercise, we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies, which is extremely positive for both our countries.  And this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to come.\n(In English.)  Canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the United States, a good integration with the American economy.  And the fact is, millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border.\nAnd both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class, to work hard for people who need a real shot at success.  And we know that by working together, by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies, we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middle-class Canadians and Americans now and well into the future.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that 100 percent.  We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada.  We’ll be tweaking it.  We’ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries.  It’s a much less severe situation than what’s taking place on the southern border.  On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States.  It was an extremely unfair transaction.  We’re going to work with Mexico, we’re going to make it a fair deal for both parties.  I think that we’re going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand and we understand.\nYou probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country.  You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what I’ve been doing and what I’m doing in terms of regulation -- lowering taxes, et cetera -- they’re coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment, and thousands of thousands of jobs.  General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants.  Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they’re doing the same.  Jack Ma -- we have so many people that want to come into the United States.  It’s actually very exciting.\nI think it’s going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women.  It’s not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me.\nSo our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we’re going to work together to make it even better.  And as far as the southern border is concerned, we’re going to get that worked out.  We’re going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy.  It’s very important to me.\nThank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nEND\n2:42 P.M.

EST\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I'm honored to be here with Prime Minister Trudeau, whose father I knew and respected greatly.  And he gave me a picture of myself and your father, and what a great picture.  I will keep that in very special place -- at the Waldorf Astoria, together.\nWe're going to launch the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs.  We have some of the great ones in this room -- and business leaders.  We have so many great women leaders around the table today, and we're going to go through your names exactly, because many of you I know, some of you I don’t, so I want to find out all about you.\nWomen, as you know, I can say that from my past life, I had so many women executives who were phenomenal -- phenomenal -- and really helped me a great deal in business.  So it was really fantastic.  They play a tremendously important role, women in our economy.  Women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households and households with children under the age of 18.  In order to create economic growth and lots of very good, well-paying jobs, we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive.  And I think that's happening in the United States much more so, and Ivanka is very much involved in this.  And I appreciate you being involved in it.\nAnd I know, Justin, in Canada it's happening big league, and it's very important.  We need policies that help to keep women in the workforce and to address the unique barriers faced by female entrepreneurs -- and they are unique.  We need to make it easier for women to manage the demands of having both a job and a family, and we also need to make it easier for women entrepreneurs to get access to capital.  And I guess pretty much all entrepreneurs, we have to help them out, because the system is not working so well for entrepreneurs getting capital.  But it's in particular difficult for women, so we're going to get access to markets and access to networks.\nAnd I look forward to hearing your advice.  We're going to go around the table, and I want to really learn something today.  And again, it's a great honor to be with you.  And, Justin, I can say on behalf of our country, it's an honor to be with you.\nPRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you, Donald, for welcoming us.  And I’m really excited about launching this, sitting around the table here with a number of successful executives who just happen to be women.  One of the things that I’ve been lucky enough to do over the past year in New York and Beijing and across Canada is sit down with women CEOs, women executives to talk about both their successes and the challenges they’re facing that are particular, but also how, of course, we create more paths to success for women across our community and across our society.\nWhenever I sit down with a woman executive, I know that she has had to overcome significant barriers that exist, and therefore is likely to have greater insight into how to help reduce those barriers for others, but also be a formidable contributor to the success of business and her economy.\nSo I think for me, it’s not just about doing the right thing, it’s about understanding that women in leadership positions is a very powerful leverage for success, for business, for communities, and for our entire economy.\n(Speaks in French.)\nIt’s a great pleasure to sit with you now and to hear from your extraordinary leadership.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  So how about we start with Ivanka, we go around the room.  Ivanka, you might just want to say a couple of words.\nMS. TRUMP:  Welcome.  I’m honored to be here, and really looking forward to hearing from each of you who serve as tremendous role models for me and so many other business leaders.  (Inaudible) our countries can lend some tremendously valuable perspective as we think about the unique challenges that entrepreneurs, women in the workforce, female small-business owners are confronted with each and every day.  And as we think about how we level the playing field for this generation and for the next.\nSo thank you for being here.  And I look forward to hearing from you today.\nMR. FARRELL:  Thank you.  I’m Dawn Farrell and I’m from a company called TransAlta, which is located in Alberta, where you're going to build the Keystone Pipeline.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  A big chunk of it, that’s right.\nMS. FARRELL:  So thanks for the opportunity to contribute to this important dialogue, and a dialogue that we’ve had for 100 -- over hundreds of years.  My company is in the business of making electricity.  We generate electricity from coal, natural gas, and also from renewable sources -- wind, hydro and solar.  We have operations in Canada, the United States and in Australia.\nAnd, really, for us to excel, we have to be excellent at operations, engineering, finance and trading, and we have to excel in the public policy dialogue that happens around energy.  And I’ll talk about that as part of today, because we’ve done some excellent work with the Trudeau government.\nNow, future jobs in our space absolutely depend on growth.  There’s no question of that.  And I truly believe for there to be future opportunities for women, we have to have growth, because the more jobs there are, the more opportunities.  And collaborations like this where we break down barriers and simplify, and build trust and build confidence -- because I think businesses invest when there’s confidence.  And my hope is that’s what comes out of here.\nNow, for us, having operations in Canada and the United States makes us absolutely more competitive.  Our Centralia operation, which is in Washington State, is one of the most competitive plants.  They have twice won our most coveted award for plant of the year.  But the reality is, teams of people from the United States and teams of people from Canada cross the border often to work with each other to share and to -- so that we can excel as a company overall.  So it's huge --\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That's good.  Well, we're going to go around.  Thank you.  Good job.  Boy, she did a hell of a job.  (Laughter.)  Wow, no wonder she's successful.  (Laughter.)\nMonique, thank you.\nMS. LEROUX:  Monique Leroux.  I am the chair of the Board of the Quebec Investment Fund and the chair of the Economy Council of the province.  I'm also a board member of large, global corporations like S&P Global, Michelin, and Couche-Tard, which is a very interesting Canadian company.  Each of those organizations, of course, have significant businesses in the U.S. and also employs a lot of people in this country.\nI feel really honored and privileged to be part of the council.  I would like to thank you for this great opportunity.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nMS. LEROUX:  We have long history of cooperation, and I think that for the woman agenda it will contribute a lot for our great countries.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you, Monique.  Appreciate it.\nMS. LEE:  My name is Tina Lee.  I'm CEO of T&T Supermarket.  We're Canada's largest Asian supermarket chain.  I employ 5,000 staff and serve 500,000 people across the country every week.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wow.  Fantastic.\nMS. LEE:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nMS. STEPHENSON:  I'm Carol Stephenson.  I'm on the board of directors at General Motors, and I don't think that General Motors needs any introduction.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we had -- Mary Barra was here last week, and she's terrific.\nMS. STEPHENSON:  She is.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nMS. LUNDGREN:  I'm Tamara Lundgren.  I'm the president and CEO of Schnitzer Steel Industries, which is one of the world's largest recyclers of metal products, sold to steel mills around the world.  I also sit on the board of Parsons Corporation, which has been a big participant in the public-private partnerships in Canada.  And I sit on the board of Ryder, which goes back and forth between the U.S. and Canada over 400 times every day.  And lastly, I'm the chair of the board of the Portland branch of the 12th District Federal Reserve Board.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very good.  Thank you very much.\nMS. ALLAN:  Hello, Elyse Allan.  I'm vice president of GE, as well as GE's operations in Canada.  And we're a digital industrial company.  We have business in 190 countries in the world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  That's good.  Good, thank you.\nMS. VERSCHUREN:  I'm Annette Verschuren.  I'm the CEO of NRStor, which is an energy storage development company.  Half of my career I've worked with U.S. based companies -- Home Depot, (inaudible) and Michaels -- craft store.  I think that our countries are so absolutely bound together by our people, our resources, our trade.  Linda Hasenfratz and I worked for many years on North American competitiveness and found ways in which we could get products and services and people through the border efficiently because, as you know, we're the biggest trading partners in the world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we're going to be working on that very closely over the next very short period of time.  There are some new things happening that can be very good.  Thank you very much.\nMS. SWEET:  Hello, I'm Julie Sweet.  I'm CEO of North America for Accenture, responsible for both the U.S. and Canadian businesses.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nMS. HASENFRATZ:  Hi, I'm Linda Hasenfratz.  I'm CEO of Linamar Corporation.  We're a diversified manufacturing company.  We have 57 plants and 25,000 employees around the world, including right here in the U.S. and, of course, also heavily invested in Canada.  We've doubled our workforce in the U.S. over the last five years.  We've also doubled our workforce in Canada over the last five years and have a lot of exciting opportunities for growth.  We're mainly in the auto parts and access equipment sectors.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.\nEND\n12:24 P.M.

Families have lost their homes, businesses, and livelihoods after devastating tornadoes swept through many, many communities.\nMy administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We’re going to take care of them. It’s remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit – there’s nothing like it.\nThere is a great spirit all over the country – and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild America to, as I have said so often, Make America Great Again.\nOn Tuesday, I was pleased to host at the White House the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion dollars in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona – creating thousands of new American jobs. That’s what we want, new American jobs, and good jobs.\nIntel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies.\nIn fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses.  We want to make it much easier to do business in America – and that’s what we are going to do. We are going to make it also much harder for companies to leave.  They’re not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences.\nI want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world – but we can’t do that if we don’t stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete.  Every hour of every day, my Administration is focused on creating jobs for our people and I mean good jobs. More jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs – that’s our mission.\nThis week, I also met with Sheriffs and Police Chiefs from across the country.  I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement – and so too will our great new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.\nMy administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists, radical and dangerous extremists from ever entering our country.  We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow.\nWe will defend our country, protect our Constitution, and deliver real prosperity for our people.\nGod bless you, God bless America. Have a great week.", "timestamp": "2017-02-10T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump’s Weekly Address"}

EST\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the American people, I welcome you to the very famous White House.  You honor us with your presence.  This is one of our earliest visits from a foreign leader, and I am truly glad that it could be from such an important and steadfast ally.\nThe bond between our two nations, and the friendship between our two peoples, runs very, very deep.  This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer.  We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control, and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance.\nThe U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region.  It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities, which, under our mutual leadership, will become stronger and stronger, and, as time goes by, ultimately they will be impenetrable.\nWe face numerous challenges, and bilateral cooperation is essential.  Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner.  We will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many in the region, including freedom from navigation and of navigation, and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priority.\nOn the economy, we will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair and reciprocal, benefitting both of our countries.  The vibrant exchange between us is a true blessing.  Japan is a proud nation with a rich history and culture, and the American people have profound respect for your country and its traditions.  I also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank you and the people of Japan for hosting our armed forces.\nWorking together, our two countries have the ability to bring greater harmony, stability and prosperity to the Pacific region and beyond, improving countless lives in the process.  We are committed to that goal -- highly committed.\nPrime Minister Abe, on behalf of the United States of America, I thank you for being with us today.  We will soon be traveling to the great state of Florida, where I know we will have a long and very successful talk, negotiations, and a very, very productive weekend.\nMr. Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  This is the fourth time in six months for me to visit the United States.  The last time was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii at the end of last year.  I am indeed sincerely grateful for the always heartwarming welcome accorded to me by the American people.\nI would also like to express my sincere gratitude to President Trump.  Donald, you must have been very busy in this very important period of 100 days after your inauguration.  And thank you very much for inviting me over to the White House.  My name is Abe, but in the United States some people mistakenly pronounce my name as \"Abe.\"  But that is not bad, because even in Japan everybody knows the name of that great President, that a farmer and carpenter's son can become a President.  And that fact, 150 years ago, surprised the Japanese, who were still under the shogunate rule.  The Japanese opened their eyes to democracy.  The United States is the champion of democracy.\nDonald, President, you are excellent businessman, but you have never been in the Congress or been a governor.  You have not experienced being in the public office.  But you have fought the uphill struggle and fight for more than a year in the election campaign to become a new President.  And this is the dynamism of democracy.  I would like to celebrate and congratulate Donald being sworn in as the President.\nThe United States is a country having the largest number of chances, opportunities in the world.  That has always been the case right now, as well as going forward.  This will never change.  And that is the reason why automotive industries and other Japanese businesses have built factories all over the United States, to engage in local production here.  Last year, from Japan to the United States, there have been more than $150 billion of new investment being made into the United States.  And those Japanese businesses have created a large number of jobs.  The mutually beneficial economic relations have been built by Japan and the United States.  With President Trump taking on the leadership, I'm sure there will be -- major-scale infrastructure investment will be made, including the fast-speed train.\nThose of you who have rode on the Japanese Shinkansen, I'm sure you would appreciate the speed, the comfort and safety with the latest maglev technology.  From Washington, D.C. to New York, where Trump Tower exists, only one hour would it take if you ride the maglev train from Washington, D.C. to New York.  Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy.  There will be even more new jobs being born in the United States.\nAnd to further deepen these bilateral economic relations between Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence, there will be a cross-sectoral dialogue to be held.  And we have agreed on this.\nAnd furthermore, in Asia Pacific, where we see dramatic growth to expand free trade and investment, this will be a big chance for both Japan and the United States.  But, of course, it must be done in a fair manner.  Never should a state-owned company, backed by state capital, should not make any economic intervention.  Free ride on intellectual property should not be condoned.  In Asia Pacific region, with Japan and U.S. taking on the leadership to create free and fair market based upon rules, should be built.  I and President Trump have confirmed on our strong will to do so.\nThe cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia Pacific, that is the strong Japan-U.S. alliance.  And this is unwavering ties between our two countries.  I and President Trump will work together to further strengthen our alliance.  We have shared this strong resolve.\nAs we see increasingly difficult security environment, we have confirmed that U.S.-Japan Security Pact Article 5 will be applied to Senkaku Islands.  The United States will strengthen its presence in the region.  And under the banner of the proactive contribution to peace, Japan will play a greater role.  At the same time, we will maintain the deterrence and also to proceed on reducing the impact we had fought through on the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan.\nAnd Henoko's -- relocation to Henoko of the impasse Futenma is the only solution.  And Japan and U.S. will continue to work closely on this.\nOn North Korea, we would strongly demand North Korea to abandon nuclear and ballistic missile program, and not to make any more provocations.  And we have completely agreed on the importance of the early solution for the abduction issue in East China Sea, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean -- everywhere we need to maintain the freedom of navigation and rule of law.  And such international order there must be maintained.\nJapan and United States have confirmed that we will strongly protest any use of force, as well as coercion to change the status quo.  I and the President will address not only bilateral but regional issues.  And we have had a very frank exchange of views on the peace and prosperity of the world that we should contribute, for any form of terrorism should be strongly condemned.  And we will cooperate in our fight against terrorism.  Japan will, of course, exercise a commensurate role in this regard.  And furthermore, the regional conflict of the refugees, of poverty and infectious diseases -- there are many challenges faced by the world, which will be a serious issue to threaten the peace and stability for Japan as well as the United States.\nBut Japan and the United States and the international community must work hand in hand in order to solve these questions.  Of course, there are disagreements, but we should not close down dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goals.  We need to have dialogue because there are disagreements.  What we mostly desire -- what is most desired by those who are challenging the existing international order is to just focus on differences.  We should not close the dialogue of Japan -- have for four years that I have consistently followed through on our foreign policy.\nNow, whatever the challenge and difficulty ahead of us, I and Trump -- President Trump will continue our dialogue to seek shared solutions.  And after lunch, I am looking forward for a weekend in Florida with Donald.  We will play golf together.  My scores in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup -- never cut to just the goal with shortcuts and short chops.  Those are the words never found in my dictionary.  (Laughter.)\nBut in a relaxed atmosphere, I hope to take time to discuss with Donald on the future of the world, future of the region, and future of Japan and the United States.\nThank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  We’ll take a few questions, unless you don’t want to ask any questions, if that’s possible.  Maybe we’ll start -- where is Daniel Halper, New York Post?  Daniel.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m curious about yesterday’s ruling in the 9th Circuit Court.  Has it caused you to rethink your use of executive power?  And how will you respond?  And will you sign new executive orders and perhaps a new travel ban?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, I’m curious about your reaction to America’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP.  Do you think that that’s weakened America’s position in Asia?  And how do you think -- how do you envision any sort of trade deal with the President working out?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, your question was unrelated to what we’re here for today, but I’ll answer it.  We are going to keep our country safe, we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe.  We had a decision which we think we’ll be very successful with.  It shouldn’t have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason.  One of the reasons I’m standing here today is the security of our country.  The voters felt that I would give it the best security.  So we’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country.  You’ll be seeing that sometime next week.\nIn addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that we’ll win that particular case.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  Now, in the world, we are also facing the issues of the refugees and terrorism.  We need to work closely together on these global issues.  Japan have always played our own role, but going forward, we will continue to work with the international community to execute our responsibility in a commensurate manner.  And each of our country has immigration control scheme, as well as policy on immigration, as well as refugees.  These are to do with domestic affairs of that country, so I would refrain from making any comments.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Blake Berman, Fox.  Blake Berman.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  I’d like to pick up where Daniel left off, if you don’t mind.  You said earlier this week -- and I’m quoting for you -- you said, \"I’ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand, but we’re going to take care of it.\"\nBased off of what you have learned, and now knowing that your executive order is at least temporarily on hold, do you still feel as confident now as you have been at any point, that you and the administration will be able to protect the homeland?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.  I would just like to pick off again on what Daniel had asked about TPP.  Do you feel it’s a mistake that the United States has at least signaled its intention to withdraw from the deal?  Thank you, both.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States.  We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign because I saw what was happening.  And while I’ve been President, which is just for a very short period of time, I’ve learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely, President.  And there are tremendous threats to our country.  We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that right now.  We will not allow that to happen.\nSo we’ll be going forward.  We’ll be doing things to continue to make our country safe.  It will happen rapidly.  And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.  We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country.  It’s always going to be that way, at least during my administration, I can tell you that.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  On TPP -- oh, of course, we are fully aware of President Trump’s decision.  On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow.  As for Japan and United States, trade and investment, as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship.  As I have already mentioned, Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence will create a new framework for dialogue, and I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue.\nNow, for the free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that importance have not changed.  I, myself, believe that.\nQ    (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  My name is Hara from NHK.  I have a question to Prime Minister Abe.  Now, for the automotive market in Japan, as well as foreign exchange of Japan, in the prior remarks there have been discrepancy in your positions.  So at the summit meeting, what were the discussions?   And were you able to narrow down the gap?\nAnd President Trump had said that he will make the United States a great country.  What is meant by the “great country”?  And, Prime Minister, what do you mean when you say United States is a great ally for you?\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  Now with the birth of the Trump administration, a new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. in economic relations.  In order to put forward such strong message, I have proposed to launch a new framework for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this.\nAs for sectoral discussions, we will be having a discussion at our working lunch.  In any case, between President Trump and I, myself, on Japan and U.S. economic relations, we will -- we have already agreed that we will have Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso to discuss fully on the economic relations between our two countries.  And we are looking forward for the good results to ensue from the debate between the experts.\nAs for the foreign exchange, we will have -- Secretary of Treasury and the Minister of Finance will continue the close communication.\nFor the United States to become a great nation, the various roles played by the United States and the responsibility to go with it, the world over is faced with increasing uncertainty.  That United States will become a great America and become a great and strong ally would be good for Japan.  And for Japan and U.S. alliance to be further strengthened would be good not only for our two nations, but also contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific and United States to become even greater.  We will welcome that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  I will say that -- and you've seen it -- ever since I won the election and became President-elect, I’ve been telling companies, car companies and other companies -- many companies:  Come back into the United States.  And they've been coming back in.  And big announcements are going to be made over the next short period of time.  Some of you already know what those announcements are.\nWe lost a lot of our factories, a lot of our plants.  And those factories and those plants will be coming back.  And jobs will be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and so many other places where we've lost so many jobs.  And those are the people that were so good to me, and now I’m being good to them.\nSo we've had a tremendous number of announcements.  We've had Ford and General Motors and many, many others -- Intel yesterday made a major announcement.  And they did that because of what is happening with our tax structure, which is going along very well.  And we’ll be having some very big news over the next short period of time.\nBut we are a nation of tremendous potential.  And the expression “Make America Great Again,” I will tell you -- and I will add very strongly and with great assurance, it will be greater than ever before.\nAnd I just want to thank the Prime Minister for a friendship.  We developed a great friendship when we met in New York City, at Trump Tower.  We spoke for a long, long period of time.  And when I greeted him today at the car, I was saying -- I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel.  We have a very, very good bond -- very, very good chemistry.  I’ll let you know if it changes, but I don't think it will.  (Laughter.)\nSo I just want to thank the Prime Minister for being here.  We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time, and I look very much forward to that.\nAnd I want to thank everybody in the room.  We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  One more.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, certainly.  Go ahead.\nQ    (As interpreted.)  Thank you very much.  From Sankei Shimbun, my name is Takita.  I have a question to President Trump.  Obama administration, under the rebalance to Asia, have emphasized Asia.  But China is taking hardline stance in South China Sea, as well as China Sea.  And North Korea has went on with the missiles and nuclear development.  So some countries in Asia are concerned over commitment of United States in Asia.  So against this backdrop, as was mentioned earlier, for the Trump administration, for the situations in Asia, how would you respond to the increasing difficulty here?\nAnd, President, you have repeatedly stated about China taking on the currency -- foreign exchange policies which are not good for the United States.  Do you think that eventually it will change in the future?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I had a very, very good conversation, as most of you know, yesterday with the President of China.  It was a very, very warm conversation.  I think we are on the process of getting along very well.  And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan.  So we had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of subjects.  It was a long talk.  And we are working on that as we speak.  We have conversations with various representatives of China, I believe, that that will all work out very well for everybody -- China, Japan, the United States, and everybody in the region.\nAs far as the currency devaluations, I’ve been complaining about that for a long time.  And I believe that we will all eventually -- and probably very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think -- we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way it’s fair.  That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things.  And we will be on that field, and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country.  But it has to be fair.  And we will make it fair.\nI think the United States is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now, by a lot, when it comes to trade.   A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which you’ll be seeing in the not-too-distant future.  We’ll have an incentive-based policy much more so than we have right now.  Right now we don't even know -- nobody knows what policy we have.  But we're going to have a very much incentive-based policy.  We're working with Congress, working with Paul Ryan, working with Mitch McConnell.  And I think people are going to be very, very impressed.\nWe're also working very much -- and this has a lot to do with business -- on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much-reduced price, both to the people receiving the health care and to our country.  Because our country is paying so much, and Obamacare, as you know, is a total and complete disaster.  So we’re going to end up with tremendous health care at a lower price.  And I think people are going to be extremely happy.  Difficult process, but once we get going -- and, as you know, Tom Price was just approved a few hours ago.  So we finally have our Secretary, and now we get down to the final strokes.\nAgain, I want to thank everybody for being here.  I want to thank Mr. Prime Minister.  What an honor, what a great honor it is.  And let’s go to Florida.

EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  On behalf of President Donald Trump, it will be my great privilege today to administer the oath of office to America’s new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price.  (Applause.)\nWe're grateful to be joined by colleagues and friends to mark this important occasion in the life of our administration and no less extent in the life of this nation.  The American people can be proud of having the finest health care in the world.  But we all have known the challenges in recent years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\nPresident Trump has made it the top priority of this new Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.  And finding someone to lead Health and Human Services who brings a background in medicine, a background in health care, a background in budgetary issues in the Congress of the United States, who understands the unique challenges of state officials in programs like Medicaid was easily met when he made the decision to name Dr. Tom Price as the new Secretary of Health and Human Services.\nDr. Price is uniquely qualified to step into this leading role during this time of reform in the life of health care in America.  For nearly 20 years, Tom Price worked in private practice as an orthopedic surgeon in the Atlanta area, mending broken bones, giving people the hope and the health to lead lives to the fullest.  You passed on your wisdom by training rising generations of physicians at a local college and hospital -- an impressive career in health care.\nBut your patients weren’t the only ones that benefitted by your leadership and by your example.  You would carry your leadership qualities into the Georgia State Senate where you served for eight years, becoming the majority leader of the Georgia State Senate, and helping to steer a time of real reform and renewal in the state of Georgia.\nThen it was on to Congress where I first met Dr. Price.  He would serve in the Congress now for more than 12 years -- chairman of the Budget Committee, but without question emerging as the most principled expert on health care policy in the House of Representatives, if not the entire Congress.\nAnd now President Trump has transformed you with leading the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of the American people.  And as Secretary, we're both confident that you will bring that experience as a physician, that experience at the state level, and that singular experience at the national level to ensure that President Trump’s vision for a health care system in this country that works for every American will become a reality in the years ahead.\nSo with that, on behalf of President Trump, is it my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.)  (Applause.)\nEND\n11:31 A.M.

EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, General Caslen.  Your wife informed me that it was not booing that I heard when you came up, but it was “Supe.”  (Laughter.)  Give this wonderful superintendent a round of applause, would you please?  He deserves it, and the nation is proud of your service.  (Applause.)\nGeneral Holland, General Jebb, Captain Villanueva, distinguished guests, and core of cadets of the United States Military Academy -- it is an extraordinary privilege for me to be with you tonight.\nTwo special guests are with me that I want to acknowledge.  A man who I knew before he was even elected to the Congress, and now he is one of the most prominent members of the United States Senate; Senator Tim Scott is with us tonight just to be with all of you.  Senator Scott, thank you for joining us this evening.  (Applause.)\nAnd my commanding officer is with us, as well.  My wife of 31 years -- (laughter) -- Karen Pence is in the house.  Would you make her feel welcome?  (Applause.)\nI’m very humbled to have raised my right hand just a few short weeks ago to accept the responsibilities and be Vice President of the United States of America.\nAnd by the power vested in me, I hear by grant amnesty for all minor conduct offenses of those present.  (Applause.)\nI’m not sure I’ll be asked back now.  But it’s really good to be with you all and, frankly, very humbling.\nI came here on behalf of the President of the United States, your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, and I bring you his greetings and his gratitude.  (Applause.)\nI left the Oval Office when I headed to West Point this afternoon, and the President insisted that I send his greetings to all of you, his heartfelt thanks for your willingness to serve our great country.\nBut more than that, the President sends his commitment to you that President Donald Trump and this administration will stand with you as you stand to defend the United States of America.  (Applause.)\nI tell you it’s the greatest privilege of my life to serve with the 45th President.  But it’s a special honor to serve with a President so dedicated to America’s Armed Forces.\nYou know, being here tonight is a humbling experience for me, and it’s very moving.  You see, I’m not a soldier.  My life did not take that path.  But I am the son of a soldier and the proud father of a United States Marine.\nMy father, you’ll be glad to know, Ed Pence, was member of the United States Army.  (Applause.)  My dad served in combat in Korea.  And he’s one of those people that earned some medals on this chest and came home and put them in the drawer.  The best man I ever knew.  He’s been gone some three decades now in our family, but he’s still the greatest influence on my life every day.\nI’m not only the proud son of someone in the service, but my wife, Karen, and I are also the proud parents of a son who answered the call of duty.  Our son is right now serving in the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant.  And like all of you, his highest hope is to serve our country with great distinction.  And on behalf of all of your parents, these parents say, you all make us proud.  Give yourselves a round of applause, would you please?  (Applause.)\nI know your parents have the same faith that we have, that each one of you are going to continue this path you have chosen with great distinction.  We have faith in you and faith in the principles you've come to serve.\nWe have faith because of those who have walked this same path as you, in ages past.  The training that you're receiving here has been generations in the making.\nI just had a wonderful gathering with a number of your most distinguished and accomplished fellow cadets.  And I heard their calling here was not just to serve the country, but to grow as leaders.\nWe’re really standing -- we're standing where generations have stood -- on hallowed ground.  If you think about it, for over 200 years, men and women from across our country have come to these grounds, driven here by that call to serve, that call to leadership -- of duty, honor, country.\nThey came here separately, in different eras, with different pasts.  Yet they all left as one, didn't they?  Forever bound to each other each one of you are, as brothers and sisters, gripping hands in the Long Grey Line.  And the American people are proud of each and every one of you in this room.\nThat line remains unbroken to this day, and so long as it continues, everyone who calls our country home can know with absolute certainty that the United States of America -- our home, our homeland -- will be safe.\nSo it is humbling for me to be here, one of the people that has been benefited by those countless generations that have gone before.  It’s humbling especially to be where so many courageous Americans prepare to protect families like mine.  And it’s humbling to stand before all of you, who gladly follow in their footsteps.\nYou are all already true leaders, and you are all already patriots.\nPresident Trump and I thank you.  We thank you for answering the call to serve your country -- to put America first.\nNow, President Trump has made a solemn promise to all of you and to everyone who wears the uniform.  On Monday, he gave a speech earlier this week, in which he essentially promised to stand with and “protect those who protect us.”  He promised in his words to give you “the tools, the equipment, the resources, the training, and the supplies you need to get the job done.”  And he promised to “honor our sacred bond to those who serve.”  These are the President’s promises to all of you.  And make no mistake about it those promises will be kept in this administration.  (Applause.)\nThat’s really why I’m here tonight on the President’s behalf.  Honoring those who serve our country requires recognizing the men and women who achieve extraordinary things in the line of duty.\nThere’s a passage in the Old Book.  I try and open it up and read it every morning.  It says, “If you owe debts, pay debts.  If honor, then honor.  If respect, then respect.”\nAnd tonight marks the 40th Annual Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper Dinner, which is all about doing just that. It commemorates a man who we just heard overcame extraordinary adversity -- demonstrated leadership, self-discipline, and courage in service to this country.\nThe year 1877, only twelve years before, the horrible evil of slavery, that great stain on our experiment in self-government, had finally been eradicated in the fires of the Civil War.  And out of those ashes emerged hope -- hope that America’s founding promise of equality and freedom would finally be made real for all Americans.\nIt was in this hope that spurred Henry Flipper to write his congressman, James Freeman, to request an appointment to the finest military academy in the world.  Henry’s skill with the written word impressed Freeman, we are told, who determined that he was indeed worthy.\nSo came Henry Flipper to where we stand today.  All who attend West Point face many trials, but Henry Flipper faced many more that we all understand by virtue of his willingness to challenge the status quo, challenge the injustices of his day.\nHe persevered through four years, making history as the First African American ever to graduate from the United States Military Academy.  But as we just heard his struggles would continue.  He was ejected from the Army only four years later after being accused of a crime he did not commit.\nAfter Henry passed away, a band of patriotic Americans took up his cause.  And thanks to their efforts, the Army righted this wrong by retroactively awarding Henry Flipper an honorable discharge in 1976.  And you heard that President Clinton pardoned him in the years that followed.\nThe following year after he was honorably discharged, his alma mater began to celebrate his accomplishments with the first installment of the dinner we have here tonight.  Fittingly, I’m told the first Henry O. Flipper Dinner was held 100 years after his groundbreaking graduation from West Point.  Altogether fitting.\nBut the purpose of tonight, I’m told, is not just to remember Henry Flipper and his extraordinary courage and accomplishment, but it’s held every year in the midst of African American History Month.\nA week ago today, President Trump signed a proclamation honoring this occasion and declaring that “the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and the spirit that continue to make our Nation great.”\nWe need only look at Henry Flipper’s life to see this truth in this statement.  But we should also look back to the generations of African Americans who have defended and died for this country as far back as the very hour of our nation’s birth.\nWhen I think of these brave men and women, I can't help but think of that famous painting, it’s known as Washington’s Crossing.  It depicts George Washington and his band crossing the Delaware.  If you look closely, if you haven’t looked at that painting, and it’s one of my favorites, you’ll see someone who is sometimes overlooked.  Next to General Washington himself, immediately to his left, is a young African American solider.\nThe symbolism is profound.  The painting was rendered by a German abolitionist who was determined to recognize the countless African Americans who fought side by side with our Founders in the pursuit of a free America -- of liberty and equality for all.\nMen like Crispus Attucks, who perished in the Boston Massacre, or Lemuel Hayes, who fought at Lexington and Concord, or the dozens who enlisted in the First Rhode Island Regiment, just to name a few.\nIn New England, some African American patriots rose as high as the rank of colonel.  Yet no matter their rank, they were, all of them, every bit as freedom-loving and dedicated to independence as George Washington himself.\nTonight I think of them -- but, of course, not only them.  I think of the nearly 200,000 African Americans who fought for the Union in the Civil War and for the new birth of freedom that followed it.\nI think of the Buffalo Soldiers we learned tonight that Henry Flipper was among them who actually helped tame the West.  I think of the Tuskegee Airmen who flew for freedom in World War Two -- men like General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., whose strength of character carried him through four difficult years at West Point, and who is now honored for his resolve with a barracks that bears his name.  I think of all these heroes in this month, and many more I haven’t mentioned, because they are the best of us.\nAnd during this month, African American History Month, but not only this month, we remember them and we thank them for what they did.  Their names and their sacrifices will never be forgotten.  For they understood the promise of America -- the timeless ideals that bind us together as a people, and give us purpose as a nation.\nThat's why we are here tonight.  We know in our hearts that America is extraordinary and that our sacred birthright must be defended, no matter the cost.  This gift has always inspired our fellow Americans to step up and serve, and I believe it always will.\nIt certainly inspired Henry Flipper and all those that we reflect on tonight.  He persevered not just through four years at West Point, but over injustice itself.  We remember and honor him tonight for his unyielding tenacity in the face of hardship.\nHenry’s life always be a model for those who find towering barriers standing before them waiting to be overcome.  For 40 years now, the United States Corps of Cadets has chosen one of its own who has embodied Henry’s courage, his leadership, his determination to let no obstacle stand in his way.  And tonight that honor falls to Cadet Lars Lofgren.  (Applause.)\nCadet Lofgren personifies the legacy of Henry Flipper and all the other previous recipients of the Flipper award.  As all of you know, two years ago, Cadet Lofgren was tragically injured during a training exercise at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  Since that day, he has been paralyzed from the waist down.  But he didn’t let it stop him.  Less than 12 months later, he participated -- I had to read this twice -- he participated in the 2016 Warrior Games, where he won an astounding seven medals.  (Applause.)\nNot only that, he then returned to West Point to complete his final year -- such is his love for America, for this great institution, and his sense of duty.\nCadet Lofgren, you are an inspiration to us all.  You are truly a worthy recipient of the Henry Flipper Award.  And I’m honored to be here tonight to be a part of watching you receive it.  And tonight you will receive it from none other than one of Henry’s descendants, Ken Davis.  And we thank him so much for being with us today.\nI know everyone joins me in congratulating Cadet Lofgren and the honor he gives us by being here tonight.\nThe legacy of Henry Flipper lives on in many others, including two distinguished guests we have with us tonight.\nPat Locke, who retired from the Army as a major, is here with us this evening.  She’s a trailblazer cut from the same cloth as Henry Flipper himself.  In 1980, she departed from these grounds -- stand up and take a bow.  Would you please?  (Applause.)  Thank you, Major.  In 1980, she departed from these grounds as the first-ever, female African American graduate of West Point.\nWe also have with us Cadet Christian Nattiel.  He is the first African American from West Point to receive the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and will soon head to Oxford to teach them a thing or two.  (Applause.)\nAll those whom I have recognized are heirs of a long and proud tradition that stretches back into the mists of American history.  But they are not the only ones.  It is this same tradition that really brings all of us here tonight and together.\nNow, we've not come to West Point, nor did our forefathers, because of the color of our skin or the creed we profess.  We gather because of our country -- a country that has given us so much, and to which we are now called to give in return.\nOne of my late father’s favorite versus was:  To whom much is given, much will be required.\nAnd I know that every one of you that has stepped forward to be a part of this incredible tradition to serve your country feels that in your heart.  You cadets before me have answered that call.  You've stepped up, and soon you will go forth.\nLast night was Post Night, I’m told, when the graduating seniors learned where they will be stationed.  You will, all of you, do our country proud, so that future generations may yet call themselves sons and daughters of America.  Let’s give all of those who participated in Post Night a round of applause.  (Applause.)\nYour accomplishments here at West Point, your leadership speaks louder than anyone could at a dinner like tonight.\nAnd your service is needed now more than ever.  Beyond our nation’s borders lies a world riven by conflict and oftentimes wracked by chaos.  Evil abounds across the globe.  Old enemies have reared their ugly heads once more, and new ones have arisen, too.\nThe forces of radical Islam terrorism seek to destroy not only our people, but our very way of life.  The barbarians known as ISIS are brutally killing anyone who stands in the way of their attempts to establish a global caliphate.  They will not stop until we stop them.  And we will stop them.  (Applause.)\nThe threats facing America have never been more numerous, it seems sometimes, more sophisticated, more zealous in their adherence to failed ideas that belong in the ash-heap of history.  But make no mistake about it:  President Trump and this administration and this country will not rest until these enemies are destroyed and our nation is safe again.  (Applause.)\nAnd I promise you -- I promise you, those of you that are preparing to enter the service of the United States of America on your graduation of West Point, we will not relent in our effort until we have rebuilt the arsenal of democracy and ensured that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard have the resources and the training they need to accomplish their mission, protect our families, and come home safe to theirs.  That is our promise.  (Applause.)\nRest assured, I can testify from what I see in him every day, America has a President and a Commander-in-Chief who loves the armed forces and will stand with you every day.  I’ve seen his dedication to you more times than I can count.  In fact, I see it literally on a daily basis.\nUnder his leadership, I can promise you three things.  First, know that President Trump and I will always have your backs.  You will have everything you need, and more, to defeat those who confront our nation and threaten our freedom, and to protect this country.\nSecondly, know that you and your families in the days ahead will always have our prayers, and the prayers of the American people will go with you as you serve.  Of this I’m confident.\nAnd last, know that we will always support you, not second-guess you, and we will never call your courageous service or your sacrifice a failure.\nBefore I leave, I can’t help but recall the words that the General just shared with me.  We took a stroll, didn't we, General, down a block to see that MacArthur statue?  And I polished his boot.  (Laughter.)  Before I left the Oval Office this afternoon, the President told me, you have to go down to the MacArthur statue.  We did.\nAnd I read those words that were I think first spoken in this very room, and they're words that really represent the foundation of the past, present, and the future of this extraordinary institution and the tradition that you've embraced -- duty, honor, country.\nMacArthur said: “Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, and what you will be.  They are your rallying points to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.”\nStirring words on a cold night, they warmed my heart because I knew I’d be looking out on a roomful of men and women who were living out that every single day.\nYou know to serve with President Trump is to serve with someone who has boundless confidence in the American people and boundless optimism about America’s future.  And it’s an honor to be with you tonight.\nBut let me say what the President would say if he was here, that looking out at your shining faces, seeing your dedication to America, we're more confident than ever that the best days for America are yet to come.\nThank you.  God bless you.  God bless West Point.  And God bless the United States of America.\nEND\n7:33 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all for coming.  We had a couple of great meetings this morning -- the airline industry, we're going to get that one going.  They've got a lot of problems but it's going to be good.  We just had talks with Qatar and a couple of countries -- Afghanistan.  I would say that that's a tough situation but we'll do something about it.  We'll be having some -- we'll be giving you some pretty -- information -- pretty good information soon.  We're going to have some good, big conversations with other world leaders over the next few hours.  A lot of things happening, a lot of positive things.\nI want to start by thanking Senator Manchin for having the courage to vote for somebody that's really very outstanding, really outstanding -- as good as they've seen in a long time.  Nominating the justice to the Supreme Court, a justice, has always been considered one of the very important things that a President can do.\nI guess I'm looking very much at defense and we're negotiating a lot of contracts with airlines and a lot of other people, but when you get right down to it, the F-35 Fighter is very important and all of the things we're doing are very important.  But I've always considered, and I guess a lot of people have, the Supreme Court nominees to be right up there -- right up there.  We'll take defense, number one, I think, Senator, we have to go with defense of our country, number one.  And right after that, I suspect it's going to be Supreme Court justices.\nAnd Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified nominee -- probably there's rarely been anybody that's been more qualified.  He has impeccable academic and legal credentials.  He went to Columbia -- very, very great student.  He went to Harvard, top of his class.  He went to Oxford, great student, great intellect.  He has an outstanding record for 10 years on the bench.  One of the great writers they say -- legal writers -- I've read some of the things that he's written and, believe me, he is a great, great writer.  He'll respect and very much respect the Constitution, as written, and he will apply the law as written.\nHe's a mainstream judge, very much mainstream, and I urge you all to confirm him.  He's been doing very well.  A lot of people are liking him very much on the other side.  And I think that, because of politics, perhaps they're not going to vote for him.  I think that's a shame because that's not being honest.\nI've had a couple of people tell me from the other side -- because, believe it or not, I have a lot of friends on the other side too -- and they think he's outstanding.  And then they go on to tell me that perhaps they won't be able to do that.  But that's one of the reasons that our country is in stagnation in so many different forms and so many different ways.  I think it's very dishonest and I think it's very unfortunate.\nBut we'll see what happens.  I think he's doing very well.  And I know that some people are going to come on board and hopefully we can do this in a very quick and civil manner.\nThe Cabinet slowly is happening.  Jeff Sessions just got -- you're very happy about that -- because Jeff is outstanding.  And we just swore in Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, and I think he's going to be outstanding.\nSo I just want to thank you all for being here.  We're going to have a good lunch and we're going to talk about our Supreme Court nominee, somebody who will do a fantastic job for many years to come.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, any comment on Judge Gorsuch's comments about you, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You misrepresented his comments.\nQ    I just wanted to ask you what your thoughts were, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  His comments were misrepresented.  And what you should do is ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn't exist after years of saying it did.  So ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record.  He misrepresented that just like he misrepresented Judge Gorsuch.\nThank you all very much.\nEND\n12:45 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for being here.  Nothing like having meetings in the White House.  Good place.  Good place for meetings.  Good place for a lot of things.  People don’t realize I inherited a mess.  A big mess.  I think they know.  I think they understand.\nWell, thank you all.  I know so many of you through reading and through business magazines, and you've done an amazing job.  And I want to congratulate you.  I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers.  I've been hearing that a little bit.  At the same time, we want to make life good for them also.  They come with big investments -- in many cases, those investments are made by their governments.  But they are still big investments.\nI'm thrilled to welcome the leaders of the airline industry to the White House.  Your industry supports over 10 million well-paying U.S. jobs and creates almost $1 trillion in economic activity, which is really big stuff, really amazing.\nLast year, our airlines moved approximately 2 million people each day in our country, which is an incredible number of people.  And they move them well -- despite the bad equipment that the airports give you in many cases, because they can't get approvals, and we had regulatory morass that's a disaster.\nAnd I can tell you that a lot of the new equipment that already is obsolete the day they order it -- and that's according to people that know, including my pilot.  I have a pilot who's a real expert, and he said, sir, the equipment they're putting on is just the wrong stuff.  And we'll talk about that.  Because if we're going to modernize our systems, we should be using the right equipment.  And I know Mr. Tilden is nodding.  You know what I mean.  It's one thing to order equipment, but let's order the right equipment.  Probably the wrong equipment costs more.  You can probably buy the right equipment for less money.  So we want to talk about that.  Because my pilot, he's a smart guy, and knows what's going on.  He said the government is using the wrong equipment and instituting a massive, multibillion-dollar project, but they're using the wrong type of equipment.  So let's find out about that.\nWe want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service, with an absolute minimum of delays and with great convenience all at the lowest possible cost.  We want to help you realize these goals, and we will indeed help you realize these goals.  Airports are very important when you travel.  Very important.\nAs an example, some of you were saying yesterday to me that you go to China, you go to Japan, they have fast trains all over the place.  We don’t have one.  I don’t want to compete with your business -- (laughter) -- but we don’t have one fast train.  And it's the same thing with our airports.  Our airports used to be the best.  Now they're at the bottom of the rung.  We've spent $6 trillion -- think of it -- as of about two months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East.  We've got nothing.  We've got nothing.  We never even kept just even a little tiny oil well.  Not one little one.  I said, keep the oil.  But we've spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East.  We have nothing.  And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains.  We have bad roads.  We're going to change all of that, folks.  You're going to be so happy with Trump.  I think you already are.\nSo we want to help you realize these goals by rolling back burdensome regulations.  And you people are regulated probably as much as almost anybody, although I can think of a couple of industries that are even worse.  Lowering the overall tax burden on American businesses big league.  That's coming along very well.  Way ahead of schedule, I believe.  And we're going to be announcing something, I would say, over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax, and developing our aviation infrastructure.\nAgain, I want to thank you all for being here.  So I want this to be a meeting of substance.  I want to be able to do things for you.  The auto industry was in.  They left, they said it was the best meeting they've ever had.  I even took them into the Oval Office.  The head of Ford, the head of General Motors, the head of Fiat, others -- they never saw the Oval Office.  I said, you mean they never took you in?  You see how far away it was from the room?  Ten feet.  It was 10 feet across the hallway, but they never got taken in.  I took them in.\nThe auto companies are going to be making massive investments in Michigan and Ohio, in Pennsylvania, a lot of the places where jobs have left.  So we’re really happy about that.  They’ve been great.  Ford is going to build -- you know they cancelled a big plant in a certain place, I won’t say where -- a $2 billion plant, and they’re building it in the United States and they’re expanding greatly.  General Motors the same thing.  They’ve been great.  They’ve been great.  I think they’ll continue to be great.\nBut we’re also going to be great to them.  We’re going to get rid of a lot of unnecessary regulation, and we’re going to make their life a lot easier.  They’re going to employ a lot more people.  So a lot of businesses are rushing in.  They’re coming in big league.\nSo with that, I thought what I would do is perhaps we’ll start with Mr. Gray.  We’ll go around the room and just quickly just say who you are and who you represent.  The biggest of the airlines are here.\nSTAFFER:  Thank you, press.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you can -- no, stay, stay, stay.  Let them see who’s here.  (Laughter.)  Everyone is so quick to get rid of the press.  I think I am the most open President ever.  (Laughter.)  They want to get rid of the press.  What, you don’t want to see who Mr. Gray is?  (Laughter.)  Maybe I should have started with somebody else.  (Laughter.)  Okay, you can stay.  Yeah, stay.  Stay for a while.  See who’s here, right?  Okay, good.\nMR. GRAY:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I’m Myron Gray, and I represent the United Parcel Service.\nMS. EVENS:  I’m Ginger Evens, I’m the Commissioner of Aviation for the city of Chicago.\nMR. FLYNN:  Mr. President, Bill Flynn with Atlas Air.\nMR. WIGINGTON:  Rob Wigington, CEO for Nashville Airport Authority.\nMR. CALIO:  Nick Calio, Airlines for America.  Thank you for having us.\nMR. BASTIAN:  Mr. President, Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Airlines.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Welcome.  Delta is doing well.\nMR. BASTIAN:  Doing great, and you know we’ve been neighbors for a long time.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right, good.\nMR. BASTIAN:  Hopefully we've been good to you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You've been very good.  Thank you.\nMR. HAYES:  Mr. President, Robin Hayes, CEO of JetBlue Airways.  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good job.\nMR. BRONCZEK:  Mr. President, Dave Bronczek, FedEx.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  By the way, Fred Smith was here yesterday.\nMR. BRONCZEK:  Yes, I know.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He's a great, great guy.\nMR. KELLY:  Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.\nMR. TILDEN:  Brad Tilden, Alaska Air Group.  And we’re actually in the process of merging with Virgin America right now.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.\nMR. FOYE:  Mr. President, Pat Foye, Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.  We spoke a long time ago.\nMR. FOYE:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you did a good job.\nMR. FOYE:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Appreciate it.\nMR. POTTER:  Mr. President, Jack Potter, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\nMR. BURKE:  Mr. President, Kevin Burke.  I’m the President of Airports Council International-North America, which is every airports in the United States and Canada.  Thank you for having us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMR. VANECEK:  Mr. President, Bill Vanecek.  I'm the Director of Aviation for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Niagara Falls International Airport.  I'm also the chairman of Airports Council International-NA.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.\nMR. LOPANO:  Mr. President, good morning.  My name is Joe Lopano.  I’m from Tampa International Airport.\nMR. MUÑOZ:  Oscar Muñoz with United Airlines.  And Mr. Doug Parker from American couldn’t be here today.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you.\nMS. FLINT:  Good morning, Mr. President.  Deborah Flint, the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports.  LAX is the world’s seventh largest airport and the country’s third largest airport.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll make it number one worldwide.  Let’s make it number one.  (Laughter.)  I didn’t like the number.  What is number one now in terms of service?\nMS. FLINT:  Atlanta.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s good.  We love the state of Georgia.  I love Georgia -- I tell you that’s for sure.  So that’s good.\nPARTICIPANT:  Number one in the world.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So let me ask you -- so what can we do to make your airlines better, to make your balance sheet better, to have you get more jobs and create more jobs, to have you win competition worldwide so you can start doing more business worldwide?  Because I know you have a lot of competition, and a lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league.  I’ve heard that complaint from different people in this room.  Probably about one hour after I got elected I was inundated with calls from your industry, and many other industries, because it’s a pretty unfair situation.\nWhat can we do?  Give me suggestions that we can make your life easier and that you can employ a lot more people.\nMR. KELLY:  Well, Mr. President, I'll lead this off.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Southwest Airlines.\nMR. KELLY:  Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.  We have never had a meeting like this, certainly in my years at Southwest Airlines.  So we’re very grateful for this opportunity.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I want to congratulate you because you have done an amazing job, really amazing job.  You really have.  So congratulations.  Go ahead.\nMR. KELLY:  I think we’re very well aligned with your philosophy.  We would welcome tax reform.  We would welcome regulatory reform.  And very well aligned on the need for infrastructure investment.\nThe single biggest opportunity for aviation is to modernize the air traffic control system.  We work very well with our partners in the airports around the table.  I know them all and we serve all of these airports and --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You shouldn't know them too well.  (Laughter.)\nMR. KELLY:  Well, they’re our landlords.  (Laughter.)  (Inaudible) the only landlord available.  But we have billions of dollars’ worth of airport projects underway around the country to continue to modernize the airports.  We've spent billions of dollars on the air traffic control modernization but it’s not making any meaningful progress.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I hear that.  I hear we have the wrong system.  I’m hearing that the United States government -- and is the gentleman who’s the head of the FAA right now not a pilot?  Or is that -- does he --\nMR. KELLY:  I don’t know if he’s a pilot or not.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to find out because I think it maybe would be good to have a pilot, like a really good pilot who knows what’s going on.  I’ve heard that, and, I don't know, it seems a little hard to believe because the complexity of your business is right up there, right?\nMR. KELLY:  Oh, very much so.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I would think you need a very sophisticated person in that job, and somebody that, frankly -- being a pilot would be helpful, because I’m hearing you put the wrong -- I hear the government contracted this system that’s the wrong system, and I hear that from pilots.  So who would be better to tell me?  But I hear we’re spending billions and billions of dollars.  It’s a system that’s totally out of whack.  It’s way over budget, it’s way beyond schedule, and when it’s completed, it’s not going to be a good system.  Other than that, it’s okay.  (Laughter.)\nSo what do you think about that, Gary?\nMR. KELLY:  Well, I agree with you.  When you have a project that takes that long, it becomes outdated.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s already outdated.\nMR. KELLY:  It’s already outdated, no question.  And we spent billions of dollars on this.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Has that been you or the government or both?\nPARTICIPANT:  Oh no, this is the federal -- FAA, air traffic control --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So when you say “we” -- “we” the government --\nMR. KELLY:  You’re paying for it.  You’re ultimately -- the airlines and our customers are paying for it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Why do the airlines allow that to happen where they put in a bad system?  Not even antiquated -- and it’s antiquated because it’s taken so long.  Why do the airlines allow a system that you know is bad from the beginning -- because you guys are pros -- why do they allow the government to put in the wrong system?\nMR. KELLY:  Well, we’re not in control.  And I think that’s one of the things that we see as the path to having success, is we need to address the fundamental organization of the air traffic organization, not the safety and regulatory oversight -- that’s a government function that needs to remain.  But we believe that reforming the FAA by creating a non-for-profit corporation is the way to address the governments that you’re speaking to, as well as the long-term financing.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Headed by the airlines?  Headed by who?  The board would be who?\nMR. KELLY:  The board would be represented by all the various constituents.  So the government would have a seat, general aviation would have a seat, certainly the commercial airlines would have a seat.  Everyone would --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, this wouldn’t have happened then.  You wouldn’t be putting in a system -- a control system -- that is obsolete before they even signed the contract.  And, by the way, overly expensive.  More expensive than (inaudible).\nMR. KELLY:  You know, the interesting thing is I think that there is absolutely unanimous agreement that the system needs to be modernized and that it is well behind schedule.  There is not agreement on the path forward to address that, and that’s where we run into roadblocks.  We want the government out of managing the air traffic control system so that it can be adequately managed, adequately financed, and we can get this done.  We won World War II in three-and-a-half years; we ought to be able to modernize air traffic control.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So how long would it take to -- because I’m hearing you have to scrap all of the billions of dollars that have been put in -- stupidly put in.  How long would it take to come up with a great air traffic control system, the top anywhere in the world, the top of the line?  How long would that take to do and how much would it cost?\nMR. KELLY:  The good news is, we don’t have to scrap everything.  We are still using fundamentally World War II-era ground-based radar to guide the aircraft from a navigation standpoint.  We are not utilizing GPS satellite-delivered navigational tools.  Those things exist.  At least for Southwest Airlines, we have fully equipped all of our fleet to take advantage of that, but we’re not getting those kinds of flight profiles written for each airport or each route.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So you'd save a lot of time, you'd save a tremendous amount of fuel.\nMR. KELLY:  We think that we're losing $25 billion a year as an industry.  And I think the best example we can offer up to you -- the system is very safe, by the way.  And our air traffic controllers are very fine men and women, and they do a fantastic job.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It's safe but it's very cautious.  And it should be cautious.\nMR. KELLY:  Yes, it must be cautious.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But I notice the intervals when planes go out seem very, very long.\nMR. KELLY:  It used to be a 55-minute trip between Washington and New York, and today it's 80.\nPARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, it's not just about fuel -- it's about jobs.  The partnership in New York City did a study that the cost of air traffic control congestion in New York and New Jersey alone is $75 billion over a period ending in 2028.  Those are jobs that haven't been created and jobs that --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And what is the reason for that?\nPARTICIPANT:  It's the antiquated system, one, Mr. President.  It's, two, the fact that New York/New Jersey is the busiest airspace in the world.  And, three, frankly, that other countries, including Canada, have more efficient systems.  Implementation and the funding NextGen is really critical.  And this is not an act of (inaudible) -- this is about jobs.\nPARTICIPANT:  Sir, you asked why -- your question -- how did we let this happen to some degree.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nPARTICIPANT:  I've (inaudible) on telecom and railroads and some (inaudible) industry, and it's unfortunate that every time you go from one industry to the other, the regulatory burden continues or gets worse.  So in this particular case, to be very frank and blunt, and to your point earlier, I think it's become political -- it's a political process, and so it's difficult for us to have control.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not anymore it's not political.  We're going to get --\nPARTICIPANT:  And you have the appointees that you --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  -- at a reasonable price.  So not anymore.  Go ahead.\nPARTICIPANT:  I would take special care in reappointing the (inaudible) on the FAA.  Whether or not it needs to be a pilot or not, I can't opine, but it would be nice to have people that actually have a thorough understanding of the business of aviation.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Is the head of the FAA a pilot?  Does anybody know?  Somebody should know.\nPARTICIPANT:  He's not.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He's not?  He's not a pilot.  I just think a non-pilot would not know the sophistication of this system, right?  I mean, better to have a pilot -- because my pilot said it's a terrible system that they're installing; that the work they're doing now is a waste of tremendous amounts of money because the system is a bad system.  That's coming from a pilot.\nPARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, when you talk about jobs, and you just recently asked about that, what we talked about just recently with the airlines is infrastructure in the sky, which is really antiquated.  But you refer to infrastructure on the ground, the airports.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Both.\nPARTICIPANT:  Yeah, and the airports really are becoming antiquated, to your point.  There is a system, there is a charge called a passenger-facility charge, which is a charge that's levied on every ticket.  And it hasn't been increased in 16 years, so it's basically defunded.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How much is it?\nPARTICIPANT:  It's $4.50.  That could be increased by a simple act of Congress, and it's not a U.S. tax.  It's a user fee.  So as a customer uses my airport in Tampa, the airlines collect that fee and they send it back to us in Tampa.  It never comes to Washington and gets approved in the budget.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The problem is, I don't like raising fees or taxes -- I'll be honest.  I mean, we're spending all this money overseas, we're giving away trillions of dollars to all these countries.  All of the countries that trade with us are ripping us off.  The last thing we have to do is raise the fee.  I understand what you're saying, but $4.50 -- it's a lot when you look at all of the passengers.\nIf there were other ways of doing this -- because you're only hurting yourself by -- really, eventually, people are going to just stop flying because it's very expensive with all the taxes.  I mean, there are other ways.  We're spending so much money overseas, fighting wars, doing things, and, frankly, making horrible trade deals.  So don't worry about the money.  I'll be able to get the money.  The money -- we're going to change things around.\nEND\n10:07 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody, for being here today.  It is with great pride, very great pride, that I say these words to you right now:  Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  (Applause.)  Welcome to the White House.  (Applause.)\nI want to congratulate you, Jeff, your wife Mary, and your entire family.  Jeff Sessions has been a federal prosecutor at the highest level and at the most respected level, a state attorney general, and then a U.S. senator for two decades.  He has devoted his life to the cause of justice and believes deeply that all people are equals in the eyes of the law -- and very importantly for Jeff and for so many of us, also in the eyes of God.\nHe’s a man of integrity, a man of principle, and a man of total, utter resolve.  You just got a little witnessing of that.  That resolve is what we need right now.  America faces many challenges.  We face the menace of rising crime and the threat of deadly terror.  And it’s not getting better, but it will get better very soon.  It’s going to get a lot better.\nThese dangerous times require a determined attorney general, which is what Jeff is.  Jeff understands that the job of attorney general is to serve and protect the people of the United States, and that is exactly what he will do, and do better than anybody else can.  He’s trained better for it than anybody else.  The level of respect that he has throughout this country as a former prosecutor, not even to mention being a long-time U.S. senator, is absolutely incredible.\nHe will be a great protector of the people.  I’m signing three executive actions today designed to restore safety in America.  These executive actions continue to deliver on my campaign promises.\nFirst, I’m directing Department of Justice and Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people, many other people.\nSecondly, I’m directing Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime in America.\nAnd thirdly, I’m directing the Department of Justice to implement a plan to stop crime and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers.  It’s a shame what’s been happening to our great, truly great law enforcement officers.  That’s going to stop as of today.\nToday’s ceremony should be seen as a clear message to the gang members and drug dealers terrorizing innocent people.  Your day is over.  A new era of justice begins, and it begins right now.\nI want to again thank and congratulate Mary and our new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  I wish you God’s wisdom and blessings in your journey.  Mr. Vice President, would you please conduct the swearing-in.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for being here, everyone.  (Applause.)\n(The Attorney General is sworn in.)\nATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS:  Mr. President, thank you for this great honor.  It’s something I never expected would happen in my life, but I do love the Department of Justice.  I care about its traditions and its heritage.  I had 15 years in that great department, and the honor to lead it now is something that I do not have words to express effectively.\nThere are a lot of things we need to do.  First, we need to value and support and encourage the fabulous people who work there.  I’ve worked with them over the years.  I know how good they are, and their talents need to be directed at this nation’s benefit in a lot of different ways.  We have a crime problem.  I wish the blip -- I wish the rise that we are seeing in crime in America today were some sort of aberration or a blip.  My best judgement, having been involved in criminal law enforcement for many years is that this is a dangerous, permanent trend that places the health and safety of the American people at risk.  We will deploy the talents and abilities of the Department of Justice in the most effective way possible to confront this rise in crime and to protect the people of our country.\nWe have an increased threat, since I was a United States attorney, from terrorism.  Mr. President, you’ve spoken firmly on that.  You’ve led this nation to say we’re going to respond effectively to the threat of terrorism, and you can count on your Department of Justice to do so in an effective way.  And you’ve said something that I believe and I think the American people believe -- that we need a lawful system of immigration; one that serves the interests of the people of the United States.  That’s not wrong, that’s not immoral, that’s not indecent.  We admit a million people a year plus, lawfully, and we need to end this lawlessness that threatens the public safety, pulls down wages of working Americans.\nIt is an honor beyond words to serve under you and your leadership.  You’re putting together a great Cabinet, which is just a thrill for me to have the opportunity to join.  And I look forward to making sure that every ounce of strength I have and that the people of the Department of Justice have is going to be focused on preserving and protecting the Constitution and the safety of this country.  We will defend the laws of this country as passed by Congress.  We will defend the lawful orders of the President of the United States with vigor and determination.\nThank you all for being here, I see a lot of good friends, and may God bless all our efforts.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n11:07 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You've never seen so much paper on a President’s desk.  (Laughter.)  That's because we're negotiating lots of deals for our country, which will be tremendous.\nAnd I just want to introduce Brian Krzanich, who's the CEO of Intel, a great, great company.  And Brian called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced.\nSo this is Brian.  And, Brian, why don't you say a few words and maybe also talk about the product you're going to be making.  It’s amazing.\nMR. KRZANICH:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President, for this.  It’s an honor to be here today representing Intel and to be able to announce our $7 billion investment in our newest, most advanced factory -- Fab 42 in Chandler, Arizona.  We’ll be completing that factory to make the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet.\nIntel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S. and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.  And we're consistently one of the top five exporters in the country and one of the top two research and development spenders in the United States.  And we've been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world.\nAnd Fab 42 is an investment in Intel, but also the U.S.’s future in innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry.  Fab 42 will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory.  And this factory will produce, as I said, the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars.  All of these devices are the most powerful computing devices on the planet.\nAnd at Intel we have a simple saying that says, while other people predict the future, we build the future.  And this factory is a great example of that.\nI want to thank the President for this opportunity to be here today.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Brian.  And you have something over there.  Show a little bit about the new product.\nMR. KRZANICH:  This is an example of the wafer that will be built in Fab 42.  This is one of our newest 10-nanometer silicon wafers.  Seven-nanometers will be built in Fab 42.  And this is the future of computing.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That's great, thanks.  Do you have any questions for Brian?  I know you have none for me, so how about -- (laughter) --\nQ    Are you going to bring back jobs?  The other business you have outside the country, do you plan on bringing them back here?\nMR. KRZANICH:  This is actually expansion.  This is about growth.  So this position is actually about growth and new jobs in the U.S.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great thing for Arizona.  Unbelievable company and product, and we're very happy.  And I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy.  It’s a lot of jobs.  Probably the investment -- what are you saying, your total investment will be what?\nMR. KRZANICH:  Total investment in just this factory is $7 billion.  But if you take Arizona, we already have two other factories in Arizona.  So we have several tens of billions of dollars of investments in factories in Arizona.  We're the number-one private employer in Arizona.\nQ    And how long have you been planning this investment?\nMR. KRZANICH:  We've been working on this factory for several years.  We held off actually doing this investment until now.\nQ    Was there something that President Trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now?\nMR. KRZANICH:  It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, all.\nEND\n12:56 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  This is -- great to be with people I truly feel comfortable with.  Please sit down.  They’ll say I didn’t get a standing ovation because they never sat down.  (Laughter.)  And I say, I got one standing ovation because they never sat down.\nBut I want to thank you.  I have great, great love for what you do and the way you do it.  And when I’m with the police chiefs and I’m with the sheriffs of our country -- and these are the big ones.  These are the really big ones.  I just want to thank you very much.  And I thought before I spoke about what we’re really here to speak about, I would read something to you.  Because you can be a lawyer, or you don’t have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this.\nAnd it’s really incredible to me that we have a court case that’s going on so long.  As you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion, but now we’re in an era that, let’s just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably 100 percent of the people in this room.  I’d like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this.\nBut I’m going to read what’s in dispute, what’s in question.  And you will see this -- it’s INA 212(f) 8 U.S.C. 1182(f):  “Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President” -- okay, now, this isn’t just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the President.  And this was done, very importantly, for security -- something you people know more about than all of us.  It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who aren’t going to do us harm.\nAnd that’s why it was done.  And it couldn’t have been written any more precisely.  It’s not like, oh, gee, we wish it were written better.  It was written beautifully.  So just listen, here’s what it says.  This is what they’re arguing:\n\"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens\" -- okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens -- \"or of any class of aliens\" -- so any aliens, any class of aliens -- \"into the United States\" -- so the entry of people into the United States.  Let’s say, just to be precise, of aliens into the United States.\nSo any time -- \"whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States\" -- right?  So if I find, as President, that a person or group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States -- and certainly there’s lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn’t even have them, necessarily -- he may be -- and \"he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary…\"  Now, the only mistake is they should have said \"he or she.\"  But hopefully, it won’t be a she for at least another seven years.  After that, I’m all -- (laughter and applause.)  See?  I just noticed that, actually.  I just noticed it.  I’m saying, whoa, this is not politically correct.  It’s correct, but it’s not politically correct, you know, this is the old days.\nHe may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary -- so here it is, people coming in -- suspend the entry of all aliens.  Right?  That’s what it says.  It’s not like -- again, a bad high school student would understand this.  Anybody would understand this.  Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens.  Okay, so you can suspend the aliens, right?  You can suspend the aliens from coming in -- very strong -- or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\nOkay.  So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want.  And this is for the security of the country -- which, again, you’re the chiefs, you’re the sheriffs.  You understand this.\nAnd I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it.  I listened to a panel of judges, and I’ll comment on that -- I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge.  But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they'd what they should be doing.  I mean, it’s so sad.\nThey should be -- when you read something so simple and so beautifully written, and so perfectly written -- other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she -- but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watched -- I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn’t believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read.\nAnd I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased.  And we haven’t had a decision yet.  But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right.  And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.\nRight now, we are at risk because of what happened.  General Kelly is an extremely talented man and a very good man -- now Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security.  We are doing our job.  He’s a great man.  (Applause.)  We’re doing our job.  And one of the reasons you probably heard that we did it so quickly -- in fact, I said, let’s give a one-month notice, and then law enforcement -- and General Kelly was so great because he said, we totally knew about it.  We knew about everything.  We do things well.  We did things right.\nBut the law enforcement people said to me, oh, you can’t give a notice, because if you give a notice that you’re going to be really tough in one month from now, or in one week from now -- I suggested a month and I said, well, what about a week?  They said, no, you can’t do that, because then people are going to pour in before the toughness goes on.  Do you people agree?  I mean, you know more about law than anybody, law enforcement.  (Applause.)\nSo I wanted to give, like, a month.  Then I said, well, what about a week?  They said, well, then you’re going to have a whole pile of people perhaps -- perhaps -- with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions.\nSo there it is, folks.  It’s as plain as you can have it.  I didn’t -- and I was a good student.  I understand things.  I comprehend very well, okay?  Better than I think almost anybody.  And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful.  It was disgraceful.  Because what I just read to you is what we have, and it just can’t be written any plainer or better.  And for us to be going through this -- and, by the way, a highly, highly respected judge in Boston ruled very strongly in our favor.  You heard that.\nIn fact, I said to my people, why don’t you use the Boston case?  And there were reasons why they couldn’t use the Boston case.  This one came later for various reasons.  But use the Boston case.  And I won’t read that, but there were statements made by that judge -- who, again, highly respected -- that were right on.  They were perfect.  They were perfect.\nSo I think it’s sad.  I think it’s a sad day.  I think our security is at risk today.  And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country.  As chiefs, as sheriffs of this country, we want security.\nOne of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security.  It’s one of the reasons I was elected.  Also jobs and lots of other things.  But I think one of the strongest reasons is security.  And they’re taking away our weapons one by one, that’s what they’re doing.  And you know it and I know it, and you people have been very unhappy for a long period of time.  And I can read the polls maybe better than anybody because it seems that I understood the polls a lot better than many of the pollsters understood the polls -- assuming they were honest polls, which I think probably many of them weren’t.  I really believe that.  (Applause.)\nBut we need security in our country.  We have to allow you folks to do your job.  You’re great people, great people.  Great men and women.  And we have to allow you to do your job.  And we have to give you the weapons that you need.  And this is a weapon that you need.  And they’re trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views.  We can’t let that happen.\nSo with that, let’s get on to business, right?  It’s really something.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nI want to thank Sheriff Sandra Hutchens and Chief Tom Manger for your leadership and, frankly, for the service.  You have had great service.  Everyone has told me about you two legendary people.  All of us here today are united by one shared mission:  to serve and protect the public of the United States.\nDuring my campaign for President, I had the chance to spend time with law enforcement officials all across our country.  They are the most incredible people you will ever meet.  And I just wanted to say to all of them right now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)\nThere are many actions we in the federal government can take to help improve safety in your communities.  But I believe that community safety begins with moral leadership.  Our police officers, sheriffs and deputies risk their lives every day.  And they’re entitled to an administration that has their back.  (Applause.)\nThe first step in restoring public safety is affirming our confidence in the men and women charged with upholding our laws.  And I’m going to add justices, judges in that category.  And I’m very proud to have picked Judge Gorsuch, who I think is going to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court -- outstanding.  (Applause.)\nSo I’d like to begin my remarks with a declaration issued to all of you, and delivered to every member of the law enforcement community all across the United States.  My message today is that you have a true, true friend in the White House.  You have.  (Applause.)  I stand with you.  I support our police.  I support our sheriffs.  And we support the men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)\nRight now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis.  Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.  In 2016, murders in large cities continued to climb by double digits.  In many of our biggest cities, 2016 brought an increase in the number of homicides, rapes, assaults and shootings.  In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the rate so far this year has been even higher.  What is going on in Chicago?\nWe cannot allow this to continue.  We’ve allowed too many young lives to be claimed -- and you see that, you see that all over -- claimed by gangs, and too many neighborhoods to be crippled by violence and fear.  Sixty percent of murder victims under the age of 22 are African American.  This is a national tragedy, and it requires national action.  This violence must end, and we must all work together to end it.\nWhether a child lives in Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, or anywhere in our country, he or she has the right to grow up in safety and in peace.  No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born.  Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger, and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.\nSo many lives and so many people have been cut short.  Their potential, their life has been cut short.  So much potential has been sidelined.  And so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken.  It’s time to stop the drugs from pouring into our country.  And, by the way, we will do that.  And I will say this:  General, now Secretary, Kelly will be the man to do it, and we will give him a wall.  And it will be a real wall.  (Applause.)  And a lot of things will happen very positively for your cities, your states, believe me.  The wall is getting designed right now.  A lot of people say, oh, oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall.  I wasn’t kidding.  I don’t kid.  I don’t kid.  I watch this, and they say I was kidding.  No, I don’t kid.  I don’t kid about things like that, I can tell you.  No, we will have a wall.  It will be a great wall, and it will do a lot of -- will be a big help.  Just ask Israel about walls.  Do walls work?  Just ask Israel.  They work -- if it’s properly done.\nIt’s time to dismantle the gangs terrorizing our citizens, and it’s time to ensure that every young American can be raised in an environment of decency, dignity, love and support.  You have asked for the resources, tools and support you need to get the job done.  We will do whatever we can to help you meet those demands.  That includes a zero tolerance policy for acts of violence against law enforcement.  (Applause.)  We all see what happens.  We all see what happens and what’s been happening to you.  It’s not fair.\nWe must protect those who protect us.  The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56 percent from the year before.  Last year, in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution –- think of this.  Who ever heard of this?  They were targeted for execution.  Twelve were shot and five were killed.  These heroic officers died as they lived -– protecting the innocent, rushing into danger, risking their lives for people they did not even know, but for people that they were determined to save.  Hats off to you people.\nThese slain officers are an eternal monument to all of the men and women who protect our streets and serve our public.  We will not forget them, and we will not forget all of the others who made that final sacrifice in the line of duty.\nGod has blessed our nation to put these heroes among us.  Those who serve in law enforcement work long hours.  You work long hours.  I know so many sheriffs, so many chiefs, so many police who work long hours and dangerous hours, oftentimes in difficult conditions and for not that much pay relative to what you’re doing.  They do it because they care.\nWe must work with them, not against them.  They’re working against you.  For many years they’ve been working against you.  We must support them, not undermine them.  And instead of division and disunity -- and which is so much disunity -- we must build bridges of partnership and of trust.  Those who demonize law enforcement or who use the actions of a few to discredit the service of many are hurting the very people they say that they want to help.  When policing is reduced, crime is increased, and our poorest citizens suffer the most.  And I see it all the time.  When the number of police goes down, crime goes up.\nTo build needed trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, it is not enough for us to merely talk to each other.  We must listen to each other.  All of us share the view that those in uniform must be held to the highest possible standard of conduct -- so important.\nYou're the role models to young Americans all across this country, many of whom want to go into law enforcement, many of whom want to be a sheriff or a police chief, many of whom -- they have great respect for you.  Tremendous respect.  You don't even realize it, but I will tell you, they have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent.  And don't let anyone ever tell you different.  Don't let the dishonest media try and convince you that it's different than that, because it's not.  (Applause.)\nThat is why our commitment to law and law enforcement also includes ensuring that we are giving departments the resources they need to train, recruit and retain talent.  As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis.  Prisons should not be a substitute for treatment.  We will fight to increase access to life-saving treatment to battle the addiction to drugs, which is afflicting our nation like never ever before -- ever.  (Applause.)\nI've been here two weeks.  I've met a lot of law enforcement officials.  Yesterday, I brought them into the Oval Office.  I asked a group, what impact do drugs have in terms of a percentage on crime?  They said, 75 to 80 percent.  That's pretty sad.  We're going to stop the drugs from pouring in.  We're going to stop those drugs from poisoning our youth, from poisoning our people.  We're going to be ruthless in that fight.  We have no choice.  (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to take that fight to the drug cartels and work to liberate our communities from their terrible grip of violence.  You have the power and knowledge to tell General Kelly -- now Secretary Kelly -- who the illegal immigrant gang members are.  Now, you have that power because you know them, you're there, you're local.  You know the illegals, you know them by their first name, you know them by their nicknames.  You have that power.  The federal government can never be that precise.  But you're in the neighborhoods -- you know the bad ones, you know the good ones.\nI want you to turn in the bad ones.  Call Secretary Kelly's representatives and we'll get them out of our country and bring them back where they came from, and we'll do it fast.  You have to call up the federal government, Homeland Security, because so much of the problems -- you look at Chicago and you look at other places.  So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country.\nAnd we will work with you on the frontlines to keep America safe from terrorism, which is what I began this with.  Terrorism -- a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand.  Believe me.  I've learned a lot in the last two weeks.  And terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.  But we're going to take care of it.  We're going to win.  We're going to take care of it, folks.\nLet today be the beginning of a great national partnership.  Let today serve as a great call to action.  And let this moment represent a new beginning in relations between law enforcement and our communities.  I want you to know the American public totally stands with you.  I want you to know the American people support you.  I want you to know how proud we are, truly proud, to know you.\nWe applaud your efforts.  We thank you for your service.  And we promise that you will always find an open door at the White House -- an open invitation to our great cops and sheriffs nationwide.  They're great people.  You are great people.\nThank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n9:44 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, the sheriffs are great people.  Well, thank you very much.  Law enforcement was a big subject in the campaign and a subject that was very well received.  You have no idea how respected you are, sheriffs and, generally speaking, the leaders of law enforcement.  Anybody involved in law enforcement, you have no idea how respected you are -- you don't get the honest facts from the press -- if you don't know how respected you are.  So I just want to say that upfront.\nI’m honored to welcome the National Sheriffs' Association.  Your leadership is here, and I know the great job you do.  I’ve known you and followed you for a long period of time.  Your efforts and your officers are outstanding.  I know so many sheriffs from my area -- some in particular -- and they're great friends and great people.\nI just want to let you know that our job is to help you in law enforcement, and we're going to help you do your job.  We're going to expand access to abuse-deterring drugs, which a lot of you have been talking about.  They're out, and they're very hard to get.  Stop the opioid epidemic.  We've got to do it.  It’s a new thing.  And, honestly, people aren’t talking about it enough.  It’s a new thing, and it’s a new problem for you folks.  It’s probably a vast majority of your crimes -- or at least a very big portion of your crimes are caused by drugs.\nWe're going to stop the border.  We're going to stop -- we're not going to have the drugs pouring from the border like they have been.  We will work with you on supporting your longstanding efforts to strengthen the bonds between the communities and the police, which is very important.  And it’s sort a new phenomenon to a certain extent, and it’s happening more and more.  And some great results out when you can strengthen the bonds.\nWe're committed to securing our borders to reduce crime, illegal drugs, human trafficking, especially in border counties.  We have a lot of the border counties represented.\nWe're also committed to working with law enforcement to stop terrorist attacks.  You've been reading about that, been seeing about that -- they want to take a lot of our powers away.  There are some people with a lot of the wrong intentions, and it's -- we've got a lot of bad people out there.\nAnd, Dana, I just want to thank you on behalf of the government, on behalf of our country for leading a strong, strong effort in the courts.  We really appreciate it, believe me.  Because as you know, we don't have an attorney general.  We have somebody who's phenomenal -- Jeff Sessions.  He’s going to be there hopefully soon.  But I believe it’s about a record for the length of time that they’ve delayed the Cabinet.  These are Cabinet members that are phenomenal people.  And we haven’t had representation, and now we have excellent representation, fortunately, in Dana.  And Jeff will be with you very shortly, hopefully.  But we're having a hard time getting approvals.  And it’s only a delay tactic -- it’s all politics.\nOne person came up to me, a senator, a Democratic senator who came up to me the other day and said, Jeff Sessions is a fantastic man.  He’s fabulous.  He’s a friend of mine.  He’s a great, great man and a great talent.  And we're lucky to have him.  I said, oh, great, I guess that means you're voting for him?  No, I won’t be voting that.  (Laughter.)  He said, politics doesn't allow me to do that.\nI thought it was a disgrace.  If the press talks loud and hard enough, I’ll have to tell you who said that to me.  You don't want to hear it.  You don't want to hear who said that?  (Laughter.)  I didn't think you’d care.  I didn't think you’d care.  I’ll probably tell you, actually.  Anyway.\nSo we're going to be very tough on crime.  So we're going to be very tough on the drugs pouring in, and that's a big part of the crime.  We're going to be very strong at the border.  We have no choice.  And we're going to be building a wall.   We're starting very soon.  General Kelly will be working with a lot of you.  And he’s fantastic.  He was the one who got approved very quickly along with General Mattis.  He’s very, very outstanding.  And I very much appreciate that you're here today.\nAnd, Sheriff, I really thank you for leading the effort.  Your reputation is fantastic, and it’s a great honor to know you.  Maybe we can go around -- we’ll let the press stay for a little while, unless you’d rather leave.  Would the press rather stay?  Just so you understand.  This is a new phenomenon.  You're on live television all over the world right now, so don't get nervous when you speak, okay?  (Laughter.)\nBut I don't think these things have ever taken place before.  But you are on live television, so if you don't want to say anything, you don't have to.  But if you do, I think it’s a good thing to say.  So maybe we’ll just go around the room.\nSHERIFF WELSH:  Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for having us here.  I’m Sheriff Carolyn Welsh from Chester County, Pennsylvania, and proud to say Pennsylvania, the commonwealth, that put you over the top November 8th.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.  (Laughter.)\nSHERIFF WELSH:  We're very proud of that.  We don't stop bragging about that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You were a great support.\nSHERIFF WELSH:  Thank you.  And I just want to thank you for, during the campaign and since the campaign, being such a strong, courageous supporter of law enforcement on the national -- on the federal level with the Border Patrol, on the state level, and the counties, municipalities, boroughs, and particularly with the elected sheriffs of the counties -- because we are the sheriff, we are the people’s representative, and we are elected by the people, and we greatly appreciate your strong and continued support.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Carolyn.  There’s a new sheriff in town.\nSHERIFF WELSH:  That's right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I hear this so much.  (Laughter.)  I hear this so much, Dana.  They always use, \"there’s a new sheriff in town.\"  So anyway.\nSHERIFF EAVANSON:  Sheriff Harold Eavanson from Rockwall County, Texas.  We appreciate your support very much.  Our county is probably about 85 percent Republican.  So it was pretty easy for you --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They were very nice.  I agree.  They were very nice.\nSHERIFF EAVANSON:  And being in a border state, I have been to the border in Texas any number of times, been to the border in Arizona.  I clearly understand the problem we have.  And previously when we’d go to the border and hear what the ranchers and sheriffs have to say -- those border sheriffs and border ranchers, it was a 180 degrees from what we heard from the previous administration.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So you're seeing a big difference?\nSHERIFF EAVANSON:  We're very proud to have you as President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And that's only two weeks.  Okay?  It’s a very short period of time.  I’m hearing it from a lot of people.  People are calling in and they're -- and people I know that are in the area, they're saying it’s like day and night.  Because we're not playing games.  We're not playing games.  We're stopping the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.  So thank you very much.  I appreciate it.\nSHERIFF EAVANSON:  You're welcome.\nMR. THOMPSON:  Mr. President, I’m Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association.  Let me tell you the difference of six months.  I sat in this room, in this chair, and I was pleading -- I was begging for help.  Today, you’ve invited us here to your home.  You're offering help.  You're delivering on that offer.  And on behalf of our members across the country, thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  It’s so nice.  I appreciate that.\nSHERIFF STANEK:  Mr. President, Rich Stanek from Hennepin County, Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFirst off, thank you very much.  As Ms. Conway said, next time, up by three points in my state -- over the top.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Boy, we almost won your state.  You know we weren't supposed to do very well in your state, and we won -- lost by one point.  I say, if I went there one more visit we would have won.  (Laughter.)  We would have won Minnesota.  But it was very close.\nSHERIFF STANEK:  Many of us have your back, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, I know.\nSHERIFF STANEK:  And I just want to say that you hit on two topics that are near and dear to my heart.  The first is opioids -- 144 people that died last year as a result of opioid overdose; 31 percent increase over the year before.  We need help.  Eighty-plus percent of the drugs come from south of the border.  Everybody knows it.  I know you will do something about it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I will.  It's already being done, believe me.  It's a big, big difference.  And we will do that, and you do have a big problem, and you have a big problem with the refugees pouring in, don't you?\nSHERIFF STANEK:  Yes, we do, sir.  And we all asking if what you're doing, which is let the courts decide, do what we've been doing.  Rule of law is strong and the proper vetting of individuals is really important to us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, the vetting is much, much tougher now.  And we need this court case.  It will be very helpful to keeping the wrong people out of our country.  You understand that better than anybody.  So I think we're going to have some good results.\nSHERIFF STANEK:  I do, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It may take a little while.  And you know, this is a very dangerous period of time because while everybody is talking and dealing, a lot of bad people are thinking about, hey, let's go in right now.  But we're being very, very tough with the vetting -- tougher than ever before.\nSHERIFF STANEK:  Sir, I chaired the Homeland Security Committee for the National Sheriffs' Association.  We heard from General Kelly yesterday, his message was right on the mark about carrying out your directives, and we appreciate that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That used to be a political position, you know, what General Kelly is doing here right now.  Homeland Security, if you remember -- it's like a political position.  Not anymore.  Now it's, in my opinion, one of truly most important positions.  So he's doing a great job.  Thank you very much.\nSHERIFF STANEK:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, sir.\nSHERIFF GLICK:  Mr. President, thank you.  It's such an honor to be here.  I'm Danny Glick, sheriff of Laramie County, Wyoming.  You know, there are so many issues that you'll hear going around this table.  One of the ones that probably isn't -- that people don't realize is EPA decisions that have affected our coal industry, our oil industry in the West.  But beyond that, it increases the number of people that are jobless and thus increases our crime statistics.  And it's starting to overwhelm us.  We're very small out there for the most part, and we don't have the numbers of deputies, officers and law enforcement that can sometimes keep up with this.  I appreciate what you've done and what you're planning in the future.  I think it was very well publicized, and I just appreciate being here today.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Sheriff.  And I will tell you that the EPA -- you're right.  I call it -- it's clogged the bloodstream of our country.  People can't do anything.  People are looking to get approvals for factories for 15 years, and then after the 15th year they get voted down after having spent a fortune.  So that's going to end.  We have one of our really great people -- as you know, Scott is looking to be approved by the Senate.  We're still waiting for that one, too.  It's a disgrace what's going on.  But as soon as he gets involved, we're going to unclog the system.\nAnd, by the way, people are going to get rejected, but they're going to get rejected quickly.  But for the most part, they're going to be accepted when they want to do.  We're going to bring the jobs back.  And your state was very, very good to me, as you know.  I mean, they were very, very good to me and I appreciate that.  And just tell the people we're going to get the system unclogged and we're going to get it up.\nAs you know, I approved two pipelines that were stuck in limbo forever.  I don't even think it was controversial.  You know, I approved them -- I haven't even heard -- I haven't had one call from anybody saying, oh, that was a terrible thing you did.  I haven't had one call.  You know, usually, if I do something it's like bedlam, right?  I haven't had one call from anybody.  And a lot of jobs -- in the Keystone case, we have potentially 32,000 jobs almost immediately.  And then, as you know, I did the Dakota pipeline and nobody called up to complain.  Because it was unfair.  Years of getting approvals, nobody showed up to fight it.  This company spends a tremendous -- hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, and then all of a sudden, people show up to fight it.  It's not fair to our companies.  And I think everyone is going to be happy in the end, okay?\nSo I appreciate it very much, Sheriff.  It's a great honor to have you here.  Thank you.  And say hello to your people.\nYes, sir.\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I'm John Layton.  I'm the sheriff of Marion County, Indiana, which is -- (laughter) --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You never met our great Vice President.  (Laughter.)\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  I'm very proud of this man.  And we as sheriffs -- this is, to me, it seems like it's unprecedented.  I look back into the history of the NSA, long before myself, and I never have -- I could never find where -- not only did the President and now the Vice President, as well, has invited us into your house to share some concerns of ours --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And in about 10 minutes, you're going to see the Oval Office, too, which is -- that's the other thing, you know, people have had meetings here.  I had the car companies, the biggest companies -- Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- and they were in this room often.  And I said, oh, so you've seen the Oval Office?  \"No, we've never been invited to see the Oval Office.\"  You know where the Oval Office is?  Ten feet in that direction -- 10 feet.\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  Looking forward to it.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look, these are the biggest people that were going there -- these are the biggest people.  So they were never invited to the Oval Office and they were only 10 feet away.  You would think they would be invited.  But you're going to see the Oval Office, okay?\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  One of the main concerns was not just my office as sheriff, but across the nation -- the mentally ill in the jails, and the people that they're being really, for lack of a better term, warehoused in our jails across America because we don't have the facilities necessary to take care of them on the outside.  And it ends up a lot of these people go to jail because the public or the police officer happens to be mad at them at the time, instead of they need to be in the jail for a very good reason.  So we just appreciate you having the back of law enforcement.  We do all feel that, as everyone with a badge knows, that you do have our backs and that we're looking forward to years of harmony and taking care of business with the people we serve.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I appreciate it.  And I will say that, in the recent election, law enforcement is with me.  I mean, the numbers were staggering -- staggering.  It wasn't like, gee, it's 51-49.  Believe me, it was through the roof.  Law enforcement and military also.\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  Absolutely.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think, generally, people in uniform tend to like me.  (Laughter.)  Explain that to me.  Dana, explain that to me.  (Laughter.)  So, Sheriff, thank you very much.  And do you miss your former governor?\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  We do, we do.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You have a good new governor.\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  Holcomb is holding down the fort for us, though, but big shoes for him to fill.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Mike Pence has been fantastic.\nSHERIFF LAYTON:  Yes, he has.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Dana, I want to thank you for your service.  Amazing the way you just stepped into the breach and have done such a good job.  And let's see what happens with the court case.\nMR. BOENTE:  Well, Mr. President, thank you for the privilege to serve you and the Department of Justice and the American people.  I'm very honored by it.  And I want to thank all the sheriffs here, but I guess our local and state partners -- it's very important to federal law enforcement and all the agencies.  And I know that Senator Sessions -- we're looking forward to him getting to the Department -- will make that an important priority.  And he wants to strengthen that bond that we have with them because it's very, very important to law enforcement.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, well, thank you very much.  And, you know, one of the things that you know better than anybody is that we had a very good victory in Boston.  So I said to everybody, why don’t we use the Boston case?  Why aren’t we using the Boston case?  Because the Boston victory was great, but it's statutorily --\nMR. BOENTE:  Judge Gordon, who wrote that decision, had a very good analysis where he referred to immigration law, and I thought it was a terrific opinion.  And I think it’s the right opinion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And a highly respected judge, too.  So I appreciate it.  Thank you, Dana, very much.  Appreciate it.\nSHERIFF PAGE:  Mr. President, I’m Sheriff Page from Rockingham County, North Carolina.  And you did very well in North Carolina.  (Laughter.)  And I just want to --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go North Carolina.\nSHERIFF PAGE:  Hey!  (Laughter.)  And I just want to say that we appreciate you being where you’re at.  The first responsibility of government is protecting its people.  As we as elected by the people and you’re elected by the people, we got that.  When you say there's a new sheriff in town, we relate to that.  You’re about the rule of law.  We haven’t seen that in many years, and we appreciate that.\nAnd I want to tell you something -- when General Kelly was speaking yesterday for the sheriffs, he made -- he was telling us about -- he went -- I saw something that I haven’t seen before. He went to the border, he looked at the assets, and he asked the law enforcement down there, what’s going on and what can we do to help fix the situation down here.\nSo you’ve got a good team.  You’re putting together a good team.  You’ve got the support of sheriffs from across the country, and we appreciate what you’re doing.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  And a funny story -- so when General Kelly was just sworn in, now Secretary Kelly, and I said, you want to have dinner tonight and we’ll talk?  “Sir, I’m heading to the border.”  I said, I like that better.  (Laughter.)  We don’t need to eat.  I said, I like that better.  So he’s right on the ball, he’s going to be fantastic.  Because everybody has said the same thing.\nThank you.  That’s very nice.\nSHERIFF PAGE:  Thank you, sir.\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  Good morning, Mr. President.  Dave Mahoney, I’m the sheriff in Dane County, which is Madison, Wisconsin.  I want to thank you for inviting our nation’s sheriffs into the White House.  You know, as the only elected law enforcement leaders in our community, we are the most engaged in our community's issues and concerns.  And I think it’s important.  I think there’s a strong message when the President of the United States invites our nation’s sheriffs in to talk about those issues that are of importance in our community.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Has this ever happened before with the sheriffs?\nPARTICIPANT:  No, sir.\nPARTICIPANT:  No, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It never happened?\nPARTICIPANT:  Never.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And yet the murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years, right?  Did you know that?  Forty-seven years.  I used to use that -- I’d say that in a speech and everybody was surprised, because the press doesn’t tell it like it is.  It wasn’t to their advantage to say that.  But the murder rate is the highest it’s been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years.  And you would think that you would be invited here, and you would think that you people would be able to solve -- had you -- if you ran Chicago, you would solve that nightmare, I tell you.  I’ll bet everybody in that room, especially Carolyn, right, would raise their hand.  Because to allow -- I mean, literally -- hundreds of shootings a month, it’s worse than some of the places that we read about in the Middle East, where you have wars going on.  It’s so sad.  Chicago has become so sad a situation.\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  I’m only three hours from downtown Chicago, and as Sheriff Stanek mentioned, the issues of heroin and opiate addiction -- I’m averaging 12, 15 overdoses a week in my community.  And we need help from DEA, FBI, and our task forces.  We need them to be adequately funded and led by leaders who want to work collectively with our nation’s sheriffs.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How much of your crime is caused, do you think, by drugs generally?\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  Eighty percent?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Eighty percent.  So without drugs, you would have a whole different ballgame.\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  I have a jail, over 1,000 beds.  Eighty percent suffer from chronic drug and alcohol addiction.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And when did it start, big league?  Or has it been going on for many years?\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  Well, I think heroin and opiates have overshadowed cocaine, which of course has been, since the eighties, our number-one drug of choice.  Now it’s prescription painkillers and --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And at a much higher level?\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  At a higher level.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Much higher.\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  The overdoses are at a much higher level.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right, right.\nPARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, I hate to interrupt -- it used to take 90 days to take a load of heroin from the border to get it into the (inaudible) mainstream.  Now it’s taking 14 days.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, well, we’ll have it take infinity, okay?  (Laughter.)\nSHERIFF MAHONEY:  I want to thank you too for seeking the input and guidance of our nation’s sheriffs on issues like immigration.  My community is looking for immigration reform, an expedited way for a good immigrant to obtain citizenship in this great country.  And I appreciate the invitation today to join you, and look forward to working with you on many of these issues.  Some we’ll disagree on, but far more we’re going to agree on.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely, you’re right.  I actually can’t believe that we’re having to fight to protect the security -- in a court system to protect the security of our nation.  I can’t even believe it.  And a lot of people agree with us, believe me.  There’s a group of people out there -- and I mean much more than half of our country -- much, much more.  You’re not allowed to use the term “silent majority” anymore.  You’re not allowed, because they make that into a whole big deal.\nBut there’s a group of people out there -- massive, massive numbers, far bigger than what you see protesting.  And if those people ever protested, you would see a real protest.  But they want to see our borders secure and our country secure, and they want to see people that can love our country come in, not people that are looking to destroy our country.\nSo anyway, thank you, Sheriff.\nSHERIFF AUBREY:  Sheriff John Aubrey, fifth-term sheriff, Jefferson County, Kentucky.  Past president of National Sheriffs' Association.  And my fellow sheriffs have brought up a number of points, and I’d like to add two to it that I know are on your plate and the administration’s plate.  The 1033 program, where we were sharing Department of Defense surplus material that helps us in our war.  They were used in the war, and they helped us in our war.  That got severely curtailed.\nAnd the other thing is asset forfeiture.  People want to say we’re taking money and without due process.  That’s not true.  We take money from dope dealers --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So you’re saying -- okay, so you’re saying the asset-taking you used to do, and it had an impact, right?  And you’re not allowed to do it now?\nSHERIFF AUBREY:  No, they have curtailed it a little bit.  And I’m sure the folks are --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And that’s for legal reasons?  Or just political reasons?\nSHERIFF AUBREY:  They make it political and they make it -- they make up stories.  All you’ve got to do --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to look into that, okay?  There’s no reason for that.  Dana, do you think there’s any reason for that?  Are you aware of this?\nMR. BOENTE:  I am aware of that, Mr. President.  And we have gotten a great deal of criticism for the asset forfeiture, which, as the sheriff said, frequently was taking narcotics proceeds and other proceeds of crime.  But there has been a lot of pressure on the department to curtail some of that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So what do you do?  So in other words, they have a huge stash of drugs.  So in the old days, you take it.  Now we’re criticized if we take it.  So who gets it?  What happens to it?  Tell them to keep it?\nMR. BOENTE:  Well, we have what is called equitable sharing, where we usually share it with the local police departments for whatever portion that they worked on the case.  And it was a very successful program, very popular with the law enforcement community.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And now what happens?\nMR. BOENTE:  Well, now we’ve just been given -- there’s been a lot of pressure not to forfeit, in some cases.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who would want that pressure, other than, like, bad people, right?  But who would want that pressure?  You would think they’d want this stuff taken away.\nSHERIFF AUBREY:  You have to be careful how you speak, I guess.  But a lot of pressure is coming out of -- was coming out of Congress.  I don’t know that that will continue now or not.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think less so.  I think Congress is going to get beat up really badly by the voters because they've let this happen.  And I think badly.  I think you'll be back in shape.  So, asset forfeiture, we're going to go back on, okay?\nSHERIFF AUBREY:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, how simple can anything be?  You all agree with that, I assume, right?\nPARTICIPANT:  Absolutely, yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you even understand the other side of it?\nPARTICIPANT:  No.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It's like some things --\nPARTICIPANT:  No sense.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sort of like the Iran deal.  Nobody even understands how a thing like that could have happened.  It does nothing.\nPARTICIPANT:  You shouldn’t be allowed to profit from the illegal proceeds.  So if you're going to sell narcotics and sell illegal drugs in our country, you also cannot profit from that.  And so we seize those profits.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So do we need any legislation or any executive orders for that, would you say, Dana -- to put that back in business?\nMR. BOENTE:  I don’t think we need any executive orders.  We just need kind of some encouragement to move in that direction.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Good.  You're in charge.  (Laughter.)  I love that answer, because it's better than signing executive orders and then these people take it and they make it look so terrible -- \"oh, it's so terrible.\"  I love it.  You're encouraged.\nPARTICIPANT:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Asset forfeiture.  You're encouraged.  Okay.  Yes, sir.\nMR. BITTICK:  Mr. President, we appreciate you having us here today at the White House.  My name is John Cary Bittick, and I'm a sheriff in Monroe County, Georgia.  And I'm a past president of the National Sheriffs Association, as well.  And I currently chair our governmental affairs committee.  And I just want to thank you for the administration working actually on pieces of legislation and on political ideas with us.  It's refreshing, and we are thoroughly enjoying it.  We are currently working with Senator Grassley on some criminal justice reform issues.  And the administration has been supporting us.  And asset forfeiture is a big thing.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, go for it.  Just go for it.  Dana will tell me if I can't or if -- (laughter) --\nMR. BITTICK:  Yes, sir.  I think they got that message.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, that's great.\nMR. BITTICK:  But we appreciate it, and we appreciate your ear.  And we appreciate you taking the time to sit down and at least talk to us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I appreciate it too.  Thank you, John.\nMR. BITTICK:  Thanks for your support.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nSHERIFF CHAMPAGNE:  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  Greg Champagne, I am sheriff in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, basically a suburban community outside of New Orleans.  I have the honor of representing 3,088 sheriffs around the country.  And you see the leadership of our organization.  These are the leadership of past presidents and the future presidents of our agency.  But more importantly than that, we all represent and oversee literally a few hundred thousand deputy sheriffs who are truly the backbone of law enforcement in this country.  We have a bumper sticker the NSA puts out that says, \"Sheriffs and deputies:  The original homeland security.\"  And so that is a force-multiplier.\nThose men and women out there are the tip of the spear, and we stand ready to help and keep this community safe, because that's what we're all elected to do.  So we thank you so much for having us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  You're a great group of people.\nWe're going to go into the Oval Office.  Does anybody have anything to -- not even a question, a statement, as to how we can bring about law enforcement in a very good, civil, lovely way, but we have to stop crime -- right?  Would anybody like to make a statement?\nPARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, on asset forfeiture, we got a state senator in Texas who was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive their forfeiture.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Can you believe that?\nPARTICIPANT:  And I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who is the state senator?  Want to give his name?  We'll destroy his career.  (Laughter.)  Okay, thank you.\nPARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, we have been invited to the White House before.  We've sat at this table with the former administration.  This is totally different.  Not once did the President go around the room and ask the sheriffs what were issues that were important to us, he or she, in our parts of the country, but rather it was an outgoing message about gun control, about other things.  You asked us what is important to us, whether it's mental health in the jails, opioid addiction.  You hit it right off the bat.  The border, immigration, vetting.  We appreciate that.  That has not happened before.  We've been here before, but we've never had a President sit down and listen to what it is that we're facing representing our constituents and public safety across this country.  And that's why we appreciate it.  That's why we're here today.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know, Bill Belichick, is a great guy, a friend of mine.  And he was telling me -- somebody told me that he'll oftentimes, wanting to get a player, he'll go to the other players on the team -- he'll say, what do you think of this guy?  You know, they all the different people.  And he'll listen to them.  And he's done very well, right?  He's done very well.  And essentially what they're -- we're talking to the people that know -- I'm not telling you, you're telling me.  That came up this morning.  I mean, that was a big statement.  And I didn’t realize it was all clogged.  The system is all clogged.  So we're going to unclog the system, and we're going to go right now into the Oval Office.\nWould you like the press to come in with you, Mr. Vice President?  Should we let them come in?  Otherwise they're going turn around, waiting for the next meeting for six hours.  They don’t have such an easy job, I'll tell you.  They don’t have such an easy job.\nQ    Mr. President, how far are you willing to take your travel ban fight?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we're going to take it through the system.  It's very important.  It's very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date.  I mean, we have to have security in our country.  We have to have the ability.  When you take some place like Syria, when you take all of the different people pouring -- and if you remember, ISIS said, we are going to infiltrate the United States and other countries through the migration.  And then we're not allowed to be tough on the people coming in?  Explain that one.\nSo we'll see what happens.  We have big court case.  We're well-represented.  And we're going to see what happens.\nQ    Is it going to go to the Supreme Court, you think?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It could.  We will see.  Hopefully it doesn’t have to.  It's common sense.  You know, some things are law, and I'm all in favor of that.  And some things are common sense.  This is common sense.\nQ    Mr. President, if it's unreported or under-reported -- \"unreported\" is the phrase you used yesterday -- but if it's under-reported, why do you think the media is not reporting, or America is not caring about this type of --\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have to know, because I'm reported on possibly more than anybody in the world -- I don’t think you have anything to say about that.  I happen to know how dishonest the media is.  I happen to know stories about me that should be good -- or bad -- you know, I don’t mind a bad story if it's true.  But I don’t like bad stories that -- stories that should be a positive story when they make them totally negative.  I understand the total dishonesty of the media better than anybody.  And I let people know it.  I mean, the media is a very, very dishonest arm, and we'll see what happens.  Not everybody.  And I have to say that.  I always preface it by saying, not everybody.  But there's tremendous dishonest -- pure, outright dishonesty from the media.\nLet’s go into the Oval Office.\n(Meeting moves to Oval Office.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So they said this is the first President they've ever seen with all the papers on their desk.  (Inaudible) cutting the price of the F-35 fighters.  We have a lot of papers.\nOkay, go ahead, folks.\nPARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, on behalf of 3,088 sheriffs in America, there is a new sheriff in town, and it's only fitting that we provide you with our sculpture.  The first time the NSA has provided a sculpture to a non-law enforcement person.  And there is a new sheriff in town -- for you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  It’s beautiful.\nEND\n10:21 A.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  That’s so nice.  A lot of spirit.  Great spirit for this country.  Thank you, all.  We have tremendous spirit and I want to thank you.\nWe had a wonderful election, didn’t we?  (Applause.)  And I saw those numbers -- and you like me, and I like you.  That’s the way it worked.  (Laughter.)\nI'm honored to be here today among so many of our really and truly great heroes.  I want to begin by thanking General Votel and General Thomas for their distinguished leadership and service on behalf of our country.  Very, very outstanding people.  I’d also like to thank General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  That’s big stuff, when you have the Chairman.  Where is -- Joe, stand up for a second.  This is one of the great people.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nAlso, Commander Vogel and everyone serving at MacDill Air Force Base.  Quite a place.  And we’re going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment.  You’ve been lacking a little equipment.  We’re going to load it up.  You’re going to get a lot of equipment.  Believe me.  (Applause.)\nSo importantly, also, let me thank all of the coalition partners and their representatives assembled here today.  We proudly -- very proudly -- stand with you, and we will be fighting for your security.  They’re fighting for our security and freedom.\nLet me recognize our great governor and a very good friend of mine, and somebody who endorsed me -- that makes him a better friend of mine.  (Laughter.)  You know, if they don’t endorse, believe me, if you’re ever in this position, it’s never quite the same, okay?  (Laughter.)  You can talk, but it never means the same.  But this man is a great, great governor and has done a fantastic job -- Rick Scott, governor, stand up please.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Rick.\nFinally, on behalf of the entire nation, let me express our gratitude to all members -- and I mean all members -- of our military serving in the United States Central Command and the United States Special Operations Command.  We salute the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, along with our civilian defense personnel, who are so important to the success of what we’re doing.\nLet me also recognize the military families and spouses who bravely shoulder the burdens of war.  I want every military family in this country to know that our administration is at your service.  We stand with you 100 percent.  We will protect those who protect us, and we will never ever let you down.  As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the American people -- highest duty we have.  I said it the other night.  Great, great Supreme Court nominee -- you all saw that -- but I said to myself, perhaps the only thing more important to me definitely is the defense of our nation.  The Supreme Court is so important, but we have to defend our nation.  And we will do that, believe me.  (Applause.)  We will do that.  And each and every one of you is central to that mission.\nThe men and women serving at CENTCOM and SOCOM have poured out their hearts and souls for this country.  They really experience things that very few people get to experience.  You’ve shed your blood across the continents and the oceans.  You’ve engaged the enemy on distant battlefields, toiled in the burning heat and bitter cold, and sacrificed everything so that we can remain safe and strong and free.  Our administration will always honor our sacred bond to those who serve, and we will never ever forget you.  Believe me, we will never ever forget you.\nWe will ensure that the men and women of our military have the tools, equipment, resources, training, and supplies you need to get the job done.  You’ve seen me say we’ve been depleted.  Our navy is at a point almost as low as World War I.  That’s a long time ago.  That’s a long time ago.  It’s not going to happen anymore, folks.  It’s not going to happen anymore -- not with me.\nBut we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted.  I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35.  You know about that.  And I want to thank Lockheed Martin and I want to thank Boeing, and I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up.  And when I say opened up, Rick Scott understands this very well -- opened up and cut their prices.  Okay?  Because that’s what they did.  And we’ve got that program, it’s going to be back in really great shape from really being very troubled.\nAnd we are going to be taking care of our great veterans.  We will make a historic financial investment in the Armed Forces of the United States and show the entire world that America stands with those who stand in defense of freedom.  We have your back every hour, every day, now and always.  That also means getting our allies to pay their fair share.  It's been very unfair to us.  We strongly support NATO.  We only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions to the NATO Alliance, which many of them have not been doing.  Many of them have not been even close, and they have to do that.\nCentral Command and Central [Special] Operations Command are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism.  America stands in awe of your courage.  Those serving at CENTCOM have bravely fought across the theater of war in the Middle East, and bravely battled a vicious enemy that has no respect for human life.  Today, we express our gratitude to everyone serving overseas, including all of our military personnel in Afghanistan.\nSOCOM has dispatched its legendary warriors to the most secret, sensitive and daring missions in defense of the United States of America.  No enemy stands a chance against our Special Forces -- not even a chance.  They don't have a chance, and that's the way we're going to keep it.  And you're going to be better off because you're going to have the finest equipment known to man.  Going to be better off.\nFor proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military.  They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the Earth and that the world has ever known.  The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large -- very, very large.\nWe're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction -- you've seen that.  ISIS is on a campaign of genocide, committing atrocities across the world.  Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino.  And all across Europe, you've seen what happened in Paris and Nice.  All over Europe it's happening.  It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it.  They have their reasons and you understand that.\nSo today, we deliver a message in one very unified voice:  To these forces of death and destruction, America and its allies will defeat you.  We will defeat them.  We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will not allow it to take root in our country.  We're not going to allow it.  You've been seeing what's been going on over the last few days.  We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in -- not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country.  (Applause.)\nFreedom, security and justice will prevail.  In his first State of the Union message, President George Washington wrote that, \"To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\"  Almost 200 years later, as the General was also speaking about Ronald Reagan, he said that wisdom comes in three very, very strong words:  \"Peace through strength.\"  I've said it many times during the campaign, speaking in front of tens of thousands of people at one sitting, and I'd always mention America first -- a phrase that you probably never heard, \"Make America Great Again.\"  (Applause.)  Anybody ever heard that?  (Applause.)  And peace through strength.\nThe men and women of the United States military provide the strength to bring peace to our troubled, troubled times.  We stand behind you.  We support your mission.  We love our country.  We are loyal to our people.  We respect our flag.  We celebrate our traditions.  We honor our heroes.  You are our heroes.  And we are prepared to fight.  And we pray for peace.\nThank you.  God bless you, and God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n2:00 P.M.

EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all.  And thank you, Gene, thank you for your great leadership of the Federalists.  Give Gene a round of applause for heaven’s sake, please.  The Federalist Society with -- distinction.  (Applause.)  Thank you for the warm introduction.\nTo my friend -- Leonard Leo, everybody, is in the house.  (Applause.)  Ambassador Gray, members of the Federalist Society, honored guests, it’s a privilege to be with you.  It’s a privilege to be with you here in this place, in Congress Hall at such a time as this in the life of our nation.\nI bring you greetings, and I’m here today on behalf of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, who appreciates the Federalist Society -- (applause) -- and all that it stands for.  (Applause.)  It’s truly humbling to be in this position and to be in this place today.  Thank you all of you, members of the Federalist Society, for your support and your hard work over the past year.  It was quite a campaign, but it’s already been quite an administration, am I right?  (Laughter and applause.)\nAnd I know the President feels the same way as I do, that we’re here in no small part because of your commitment and the ideals of the Federalist Society to restore the promise of America.\nAnd it’s fitting that we’re in Philadelphia today, in the shadow of Independence Hall, only steps away from where our Founding Fathers proclaimed ideals that have echoed throughout the ages.  They declared these truths to be self-evident, that we are, all of us, created equal, and that we are endowed not by government, but that we are endowed, as the President himself recited this week at the National Prayer Breakfast, endowed by our Creator with the inalienable rights of life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That principle is at the center of the American experience, and it will always be.  (Applause.)\nThe men who wrote these words will ever be honored in the American pantheon -- Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison, and so many more.  The documents they drafted, the Declaration of Independence, the year in which they signed it, 1776, are now synonymous with freedom of the world.  What they did that day is the greatest gift we have as sons and daughters of the United States.  It’s humbling to be so near to where they pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.\nYet our Founders were not finished with their noble work, were they?  In the words of Abraham Lincoln, they had labored to create an “apple of gold.”  Now they needed a “picture of silver” to frame it in, to “adorn” and to “preserve” the principles at the heart of our exceptional experiment in self-government.  And so it would be 11 years later, in the summer of 1787, our Founding Fathers returned to Independence Hall.  They came to craft a framework of government that would protect those timeless ideals -- the ideals that bind us together as a people and give us purpose as a nation.\nThey gave us the Constitution of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  It was, it is, and I believe it will forever be the greatest charter of liberty our world has ever seen.  It has fostered our nation’s unparalleled success.  And it is, to this day, the greatest bulwark against tyranny in history.\nThis is the Constitution that President Trump and I have both sworn to uphold.  On January 20th, just over two weeks ago, we stood before the American people and before God, and we made solemn vows.  In my oath of office, I simply promised to “support and defend the Constitution,” as did the President.  And I promise you, we will keep that oath.  (Applause.)\nPeople keep asking me what it was like up there on the stage.  I tell people it was just very humbling -- it was humbling for me to be there.  You see, my grandfather came to this country from a little town in Ireland called Tubercurry when he was about our son’s age.  He got on a boat, he crossed the Atlantic, and he went through Ellis Island and took a train to Chicago, Illinois, where he drove a bus for 40 years.  He was the proudest man I ever knew.  The fact that Richard Michael Cawley had the courage to cross that ocean is why Michael Richard Pence is now the Vice President of the United States of America.\nIt is, I expect, startling to him -- knowing me as well as he did -- (laughter) -- in more ways than one.  I found myself thinking up on that stage what that Irishman must be thinking looking down from Glory, and I’ve only come to one conclusion:  He was right.  Not about me, he was right about America, where anybody can be anybody because of the system of liberty that we have enshrined in the Constitution and the founding documents of this nation.  (Applause.)\nThat moment was made all the more special to me because of the man who administered my oath of office, Justice Clarence Thomas.  (Applause.)  I’m privileged to have met Justice Thomas about a decade ago, when I was a member of Congress, and privileged to have a chance to get acquainted with a man of his conviction and his courage on the Supreme Court of the United States.  I know everyone in this room holds Justice Thomas in the same high regard.  Not only that, we want to aid him in his lonely fight -- his lonely fight too often on the Supreme Court -- and we can do that best by giving Justice Clarence Thomas another colleague on the bench who shares his courage and his commitment to our nation’s guiding documents.  And this we are doing.  (Applause.)\nYou know, the American people elected President Trump I believe in significant part because of his vow to do just that --- to nominate someone to the Supreme Court in the mold of not only Justice Thomas, but also of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.  (Applause.)  It was such a special night earlier this week when we were joined not only by our nominee and his wife, but also by the widow of Justice Scalia and his son, who was with us there and shared that moment.  Justice Antonin Scalia’s devotion to the Constitution will be forever remembered by the people of the United States of America.  (Applause.)\nBut this was President Trump’s promise.  And make no mistake about it, my friends in the Federalist Society, we’re in the promise-keeping business in Washington, D.C. now.\nBefore I say any more, it behooves us to remember Justice Scalia’s legacy and to honor his memory.  We all knew the late Justice, some of you personally, others through his titanic impact on our nation’s laws.  The Federalist Society actually owes him a great deal.  Justice Scalia was one of its first faculty mentors in the early 1980s, I’m told, at the University of Chicago.  Our country owes a great deal to him, too.  His incomparable opinions -- even more, his incisive dissents -- will stand the test of time, influencing future generations of lawyers through his wit and wisdom.  As his successor said the other night, America misses Justice Scalia greatly.  And I know we’ll always cherish him in our hearts.  Would you mind getting to your feet and just showing how much we appreciate the life and work and memory of the late Justice Antonin Scalia?  (Applause.)\nI mentioned before that last week, I had the great privilege to speak with the Justice’s widow, Maureen.  And the President had asked me to invite her to join us at the White House, as I said, for the Supreme Court announcement the next day.  But during the conversation, I told her that President Trump was about to nominate a worthy replacement for her husband and before I could go any further, she stopped me and said, actually, that’s not how the President puts it.  She said, “The President actually told me that no one can replace my husband.  They can only succeed him.”  (Laughter.)  Isn’t that wonderful?  And it’s true, and we all know why.\nAnd that’s why President Trump devoted so much energy to picking the best possible nominee.  Last year, President Trump took the unprecedented step of releasing a list of the 21 men and women he was considering for the Supreme Court.  There was full transparency literally every step of the way, unprecedented transparency in this process.  Each individual the President named shared several key qualifications:  sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and an unwavering commitment to the Constitution of the United States.\nFour days ago, as you all know, President Trump nominated someone who fits this description to a tee:  Judge Neil M. Gorsuch.  (Applause.)\nMy friends, I can say with the utmost confidence:  Judge Gorsuch is a worthy successor to Justice Antonin Scalia.\nBy the grace of God, and with what I know will be the tireless efforts of everyone in this room, I believe Neil Gorsuch soon take his seat as an associate justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.  (Applause.)\nWhen you get right down to it, Judge Gorsuch plain and simple is one of the most mainstream, respected, and exceptionally qualified Supreme Court nominees in American history.\nBut don’t take my word for it.  That actually was the conclusion of the American Bar Association in 2006.  (Laughter.)  After President George W. Bush nominated him to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, the ABA gave him a unanimous rating of “well-qualified” -- which is the highest possible recommendation.\nAnd the United States Senate agreed.  Only two months after Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the court of appeals, the Senate confirmed him by a unanimous voice vote, and nearly a third of those senators, on both sides of the aisle, are still serving in the Senate today.  A unanimous vote.  As President Trump asked on Tuesday, “can you believe that?”  (Laughter.)\nOh, yes, you can, when you look at Judge Gorsuch’s record ever since.  In his decade on the 10th Circuit, he has established himself as a fair and impartial judge who has been faithful to the Constitution.  He is well-known by his peers as a keen legal thinker and, just as important, a clear legal writer.  It’s evident to all that he’s a man also of high character and courage -- indispensable qualities for a jurist.\nOver the past few days it’s been amazing to see the outpouring of support from those who know Judge Gorsuch and his work.  Ed Whelan from the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a former clerk to Justice Scalia declared him a “dedicated originalist and textualist” who “writes with clarity, force, and verve.”\nThe Wall Street Journal praised him as a “distinguished choice who will adhere to the original meaning of the Constitution.”\nAnd Leonard Leo, who of course is here, called him an “exceptional jurist.”\nBy the way, Leonard, let me say again how much I and the President appreciate your tireless work on behalf of our country and the Constitution.  We are grateful for all you have done.  (Applause.)\nNow, I should also note that Judge Gorsuch is so well-liked that even those who disagree with him sing his praises.\nNorm Eisen, President Obama’s former ethics czar, simply said Judge Gorsuch is “a great guy.”\nAnd Neal Katyal, the acting solicitor general under President Obama, endorsed Judge Gorsuch in the strongest possible terms.  He called him “an extraordinary judge” who will “help restore confidence in the rule of law.”\nThat’s what this is really all about, isn’t it?  Our constitutional order requires the rule of law, without exception.  We are, after all, a nation of laws.\nJudge Gorsuch firmly understands this.  He has said on many occasions that judges must apply the law as written, without regard to their own politics or personal feelings.\nHe put it well on Tuesday and movingly, saying “in our legal order it’s for Congress and not the courts to write new laws.”  He added, “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives.”  And my favorite line sitting as I was on the front row was this one -- he said:  “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.”\nI don’t know about you, but that’s my kind of Supreme Court justice.  (Applause.)\nBut it’s not just his words.  Judge Gorsuch’s record on the bench clearly demonstrates his fidelity to the wisdom of the Founders rather than the whims of our own day and age.\nHe has written more than 200 published opinions in his decade on the 10th Circuit.  And if you read them all, and some have, which the President’s team I promise you did, an unmistakable picture emerges:  He is an originalist and a textualist who will pick up right where Justice Scalia left off.\nJudge Gorsuch has such a long history of upholding the separation of powers and the checks and balances between the three branches.  He also defends the Constitution’s unique system of federalism, and he restricts the national government to the specific and enumerated powers enshrined in the Constitution, while leaving to the states much more sizeable control over their lives and destinies.\nThese carefully calibrated mechanisms, so wisely designed by our Founding Fathers, are a strong foundation for the protection of the American people’s fundamental liberties.  By defending them, Judge Gorsuch has shown himself to be a true friend of our freedoms.\nIt should be abundantly clear that Judge Neil Gorsuch is indeed a worthy successor to Justice Antonin Scalia.  He is cut from the same cloth.  Our Constitution and our country will be stronger with him on the Supreme Court.\nBut we're not there yet, which is why I’m here.  (Laughter.)  First, of course, we must abide by the Constitution and secure the “advice and consent of the Senate.”\nThe morning after his nomination, I had the privilege of escorting Judge Gorsuch to Capitol Hill for the first time.  I’m pleased to report in just a few short days he has already met with 12 senators in both political parties.  And he making himself available to meet with all 100 members of the Senate -- if they’re willing to meet with him.\nOf course, several announced their opposition within minutes of his nomination.  And now they’re even threatening to filibuster procedure in the Senate to stop him.  Make no mistake about it, this would be an unwise and an unprecedented act.\nNever before in the history of our country has an associate justice nominee to the Supreme Court faced a successful filibuster, and Judge Neil M. Gorsuch should not be the first.  (Applause.)\nNow let me tell you, President Trump and I have full confidence that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed.  But rest assured, we will work with the Senate leadership to ensure that Judge Gorsuch gets an up or down vote on the Senate floor -- one way or the other.  (Applause.)\nThis seat does not belong to any party, or any ideology, or any interest group.  This seat on the Supreme Court belongs to the American people, and the American people deserve a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.  (Applause.)\nMy friends, this is a historic time for our country.  We are on the verge literally of reaffirming the supremacy of the Constitution on our nation’s Supreme Court.  We are giving a new voice to the age-old vision of our Founding Fathers.  We are rededicating ourselves and our country to the timeless principles that they proclaimed only a few steps away from right where we’re standing today.\nUnder President Trump’s leadership, we are returning power to the American people, the rightful rulers of the greatest nation the world has ever known.\nWe have much work to do, but I’m confident with the grace of God, we will accomplish the task before us.  So let me just close by saying thank you.  Thank you to all of you for your work as men and women of the law, participants in the Federalist Society, your own fealty to the Constitution of the United States and the way you live that out in your lives and in your careers.\nI must tell you that it’s inspiring to be with you today.  And I truly do believe that for all our nation has accomplished over these last 241 years, I’m absolutely confident that as we keep faith with the ideals that were first minted just a few steps away from here in our founding documents -- in that Declaration and in that Constitution -- the best days for America are yet to come.\nThank you very much and God bless you and may God bless --(applause).\nEND\n1:22 P.M.

He is a man of principle. He has an impeccable resume. He is widely respected by everyone. And, Judge Gorsuch's proven track record upholding the Constitution makes him the ideal person to fill the vacancy left by the late, great Antonin Scalia, a truly fabulous justice.\nTen years ago, the Senate unanimously approved Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge members of both parties to support Judge Gorsuch and, in so doing, to protect our laws and our freedoms.\nThis week we also took significant action to roll back the massive regulation that is devastating our economy and crippling American companies and jobs.\nThat's why I have issued a new executive order to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction. This order requires that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must—and I mean must—be eliminated. It’s out of control.\nThe January employment report shows that the private sector added 237,000 jobs last month. A lot of that has to do with the spirit our country now has. Job growth far surpassed expectations in January, and the labor force participation also grew, so you can be encouraged about the progress of our economy. It’s going to be a whole new ball game.\nBut there is still much work to do. That I can tell you.\nAlso this week, on the first day of Black History Month, I was pleased to host African American leaders at the White House. We are determined to deliver more opportunity, jobs and safety for the African-American citizens of our country. America can really never, ever rest until children of every color are fully included in the American Dream—so important. I think, probably, one of my most and maybe my most important goal. It is our mutual duty and obligation to make sure this happens.\nAt Dover Air Force Base on Wednesday I joined the family of Chief Special Warfare Operator William \"Ryan\" Owens as our fallen hero was returned home. A great man. Chief Owens gave his life for his country and for our people. Our debt to him and his family, a beautiful family, is eternal.\nGod has truly blessed this nation to have given us such a brave and selfless patriot as Ryan. We will never forget him. We will never ever forget those who serve. Believe me.\nAnd I will never forget that my responsibility is to keep you—the American people—safe and free.\nThat's why last week I signed an executive order to help keep terrorists out of our country. The executive order establishes a process to develop new vetting and mechanisms to ensure those coming into America love and support our people. That they have good intentions.\nOn every single front, we are working to deliver for American workers and American families. You, the law-abiding citizens of this country, are my total priority. Your safety, your jobs and your wages guide our decisions.\nWe are here to serve you, the great and loyal citizens of the United States of America.\nThe forgotten men and women will be never be forgotten again.  Because from now on, it's going to be America First. That’s how I got elected, that’s why you voted for me, and I will never forget it.\nGod Bless You, and God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-02-03T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump's Weekly Address"}

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, everybody, for being here this morning.  This is a really world-class group and I want to thank and congratulate Steve.  You have done, as usual, an amazing job.  Steve called me up the day after the election -- it might have even been the same night, Jamie, to be honest with you.  You know Steve -- (inaudible) -- in fact, I think maybe one minute.  And he said, I'd like to put together a group of world-class leaders and that's what he's done.  So good job, Steve.\nA couple of things happened this morning -- 227,000 jobs, great spirit in the country right now.  So we're very happy about that.  I think that it's going to continue big league.  We're bringing back jobs, we're bringing down your taxes.  We're getting rid of your regulations.  And I think it's going to be some really very exciting times ahead.  We're going to be doing -- we're doing it, we're going to be coming up with a tax bill soon, a health care bill even sooner.  And it's really working out.\nToby from the Cleveland Clinic has been helping us a lot with the veterans, and we appreciate that, Toby.  You've been amazing.  And I and all of our friends, we really appreciate it.\nOne of the things that I heard this morning in watching the news was that, amazingly, it's never happened before, that politics has become a much bigger subject than the Super Bowl -- this is usually Super Bowl territory.  And I have to say that politics is more interesting to people.  So that's good.\nI see we have Larry here -- where is Larry Fink?  Larry did a great job for me.  He managed a lot of my money, and, I have to tell you, he got me great returns last year.  (Laughter.)  And then they go crazy -- they'll meet very smart people that made money, why don't you let other people to run the economy?  I said, no, we have to get the right people.  And the people that voted for me understand that, and that's what they want.\nSo when I campaigned for office, I promised the American people that I'd ask for our country's best and brightest, and we have that.  Wilbur is representing us as secretary.  I tell you, you're going to be so great -- Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross.  In fact, Carl Icahn got called up, and he goes, I hear you got Wilbur.  Everybody calls him Wilbur.  I've never heard him called -- what, we just know him as Wilbur, right?  We've got the great Jack Welch, the legendary Jack Welch.  We appreciate him.\nWe're looking forward in a little while, and we have coming in a few moments, to discuss all of the things that you think we can do to bring back our jobs, to get taxes even lower than what they'll be cutting them.  We have a great plan, but I want to have your input on the plan in particular and to do what we have to do in terms of regulation.  We have some of the bankers here.  There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it.  But we expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because, frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that have nice businesses that can’t borrow money, they just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.  So we’ll be talking about that, Jamie, in terms of the banking industry.\nAnd with that, I just want to introduce somebody I’ve known for a long time.  He’s done a fantastic job, and we’re thinking of have these meetings -- I think we’ll start maybe on a monthly basis.  It will go to a quarterly basis, because all of a sudden monthly basis sounds like a lot.\nBut we really want your input.  We have the biggest, the brightest in the world.  They’re in this country, in this case.  We also have a manufacturing group which is worldwide, where we have, as you know, great companies representing.  But these are the biggest and the best minds in this country, and I really appreciate you being here.\nAnd I want to thank Steve.  And Steve is going to say a few words.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  Sure.  Well, I’d like to just start out and thank everybody for being here.  The purpose of this group isn’t for general discussion, which is okay.  But the real purpose is to get things done, to advise the government as to areas where we can do things a lot better as a country, for all Americans, and de-bottleneck some things.\nWe have a full agenda, unlike a lot of other meetings that happen of this general type.  We’re going to cover some of the immigration things.  We’re going to cover regulatory, I believe.  We’re going to cover tax and trade, women in the workplace, infrastructure and education.  And in each of those areas we'll get suggestions, ways to make things happen, happen faster to improve the country.\nAnd anybody can say anything else they want.  But it’s really important that we mobilize the non-governmental sector, and also, importantly, that we do it on a bipartisan basis.  Apparently, a first in Washington for a (inaudible) Washington.  And everybody on the group was selected because they’re terrific, because they have domain expertise, because they want the country to do better.  And we had no criteria -- we have all kinds of different people from different backgrounds and different political persuasions.  And if we can make things work right, that’s the way the country is supposed to work.\nAnd so it’s a big sacrifice for the people who are here to spend the time.  Everybody is busy.  That’s America.  So to puts those things aside to focus on this, not just for me, but there’s prep work that goes into any successful meeting -- means these people who attended have taken the time to care about their country.\nAnd so that’s the spirit in which we’re approaching things.  I want to thank everybody on the committee here.  You're terrific.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  We're going to go around the room, but before we do that I just want to say that so many people I call friends of mine in big business, and they wanted to be in the committee.  And I call Steve and I say, Steve, can we get so-and-so?  No.  (Laughter.)  I said, what do you mean no?  (Laughter.)  It’s a big business, massive business -- you know, public companies.  And every once in a while I’d call him -- Steve, how about this one?  I don’t -- he’s a corporate raider, these people don’t want to be sitting with corporate raiders.  (Laughter.)  Five raiders that wanted to come.  But he’s been very, very selective.  And we’ll be putting a couple of more (inaudible).  He’s been very selective.\nI thought we might go around the room -- Mary and I met last week, we had a fantastic meeting on the auto industry.  We had Ford there, we had a lot of companies.  We had some great companies -- Fiat-Chrysler, Sergio.  And I will tell you, I learned a lot about the automobile business.  I thought I knew a lot, but they are being so stymied, so restricted with regulation and so many other reasons, and they’re pouring back into the country already.\nIf you look at Mark, who was telling us what they’re doing with Ford, and Bill Ford, too.  A lot of jobs are going to be coming back into Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and all of the places that really have been hurt so badly.\nSo maybe we can start with Mary.  We’ll just go around the room real fast so that everybody -- pretty much everybody knows each other, but it would be nice to see.\nMS.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So it's great to have Harley-Davidson.  What a great, great group of people and what a fantastic job you do.  And thank you for all of the votes you gave me in Wisconsin.  Some people thought that was an upset; I thought we were going to win it.  From the beginning, we thought we were going to win it.\nHarley-Davidson is a true American icon, one of the greats.  Your motorcycles have carried American servicemembers in the war -- in the wars.  They take care of our police officers.  And I see it so often -- whenever I go -- whenever there's a motorcycle group, oftentimes it's a Harley.  And the sound of that Harley is a little different, I have to tell you.  It's really good.\nSo thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America.  And I think you're going to even expand -- I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.  You see what's happening.\nI'm especially honored to welcome the steelworkers and the machinists to the White House.\nWho is a steelworker here?  Well, you're all steelworkers, essentially, right?\nBut you folks have been terrific to me.  Sometimes your top people didn't support me but the steelworkers supported me, right?  A lot of your top people are going to be losing their jobs pretty soon I guess but they're all coming around -- we're getting them.  But the workers supported us big league.  We want to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and more factories in the United States, and you're a great example of it.  That means we have to make America the best country on Earth to do business, and that's what we're in the process of doing -- we're redoing NAFTA, redoing a lot of our trade deals, and we're negotiating properly with countries -- even countries that are allies -- a lot of people taking advantage of us, a lot of countries taking advantage of us, really terribly taking advantage of us.\nWe had one instance in Australia -- I have a lot of respect for Australia, I love Australia as a country -- but we had a problem where, for whatever reason, President Obama said that they were going to take probably well over a thousand illegal immigrants who were in prisons and they were going to bring them and take them into this country.  And I just said why?  I just wanted to ask a question -- I could ask that question of you -- why?  One thousand-two-hundred-fifty -- it could be 2,000, it could be more than that, and I said, why?  Why are we doing this?  What's the purpose?  So we'll see what happens.  But a previous administration does something, you have to respect that, but you can also say, why are we doing this?  That's why we're in the jams that we're in.\nAnd you guys especially, the steelworkers, understand what I'm saying, right?  So I just -- we have some wonderful allies and we're going to keep it that way, but we have to be treated fairly also.  We have to be treated fairly.  In this administration, our allegiance will be to the American workers and to American businesses, like Harley-Davidson, that were very strong in the 1980s and I remember this -- you were victims of trading abuse -- big trading abuse, where they were dumping all sorts of competitors all over the place.  And Ronald Reagan stepped in and he put on large tariffs and you wouldn't be talking about Harley-Davidson probably right now if he didn't do that.\nBut we're going to help you, too, and we're going to make it really great for business -- not just you, but for everybody.  We're going to be competitive with anybody in the world.  We're going to be doing taxing policies very soon it's going to be coming out.  And I know health care is a big problem for every country -- every company as you know has suffered from Obamacare because of the tremendous cost and that's one of the things that we're working on hardest -- that and tax policy, and tariffs and trade.\nSo I think you will be very happy.  It's an honor to have you at lunch.  I really appreciate your support.  You've given me tremendous support, your workers in particular have given tremendous support.  I want to thank the people of Wisconsin in particular.  It's been amazing what happened up there.  It was a big shocker that evening when they showed -- wow -- I'll never forget, wow, Wisconsin just went for Trump.  Then all of these people, especially that guy right there -- (laughter) -- not but then they said, what's going on?  Wisconsin just went for Trump.  And then Michigan went for Trump and Pennsylvania.  So they were great.\nYou're just great people.  These are amazing people and they get it.  So, again, to all of you at the table today, thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  We really appreciate it greatly.\nQ    Mr. President, is military action off the table in Iran?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Nothing is off the table.\nQ    Mr. President, the Russians are thanking you for easing sanctions.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven't eased anything.\nQ    That's what they said.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I haven't eased anything.\nEND\n1:16 P.M.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mark.  So nice.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be here this morning.  And so many faith leaders -- very, very important people to me -- from across our magnificent nation, and so many leaders from all across the globe.\nToday we continue a tradition begun by President Eisenhower some 64 years ago.  This gathering is a testament to the power of faith, and is one of the great customs of our nation, and I hope to be here seven more times with you.  (Laughter and applause.)\nI want very much to thank our co-chairs, Senator Bowzman and Senator Coons, and all of the congressional leadership -- they’re all over the place.  We have a lot of very distinguished guests.\nAnd we have one guest who was just sworn in last night -- Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State.  (Applause.)  Going to do a great job.  Some people didn’t like Rex because he actually got along with leaders of the world.  I said, no, you have to understand, that’s a good thing.  (Laughter.)  That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.  He’s respected all over the world, and I think he’s going to go down as one of our great, great secretaries.  We appreciate it.  Thank you, thank you, Rex.  (Applause.)\nThank you as well to Senate Chaplain Barry Black for his moving words.  And I don't know, Chaplain, whether or not that’s an appointed position.  Is that an appointed position?  I don’t even know if you’re a Democrat or if you’re a Republican, but I’m appointing you for another year -- the hell with it.  (Laughter and applause.)  And I think it’s not even my appointment, it’s the Senate’s appointment, but we’ll talk to them.  Your son is here.  Your job is very, very secure, okay?  (Laughter.)  Thank you, Barry.  Appreciate it very much.\nI also want to thank my great friends, though, Roma.  Where’s Roma?  Beautiful Roma Downey.  The voice of an angel.  She’s got the voice -- every time I hear it, that voice is so beautiful.  Everything is so beautiful about Roma, including her husband because he’s a special, special friend, Mark Burnett -- for the wonderful introduction.  So true.  So true.  I said to the agent, I’m sorry.  The only thing more -- I actually got on the phone and fired him myself because he said, you don’t want to do it, it’ll never work, it’ll never, ever work.  You don’t want to do it.  I said, listen -- but I really fired him after it became the number-one show.  It became so successful, and he wanted a commission, and he didn’t want to do it.  That’s what I really said.  (Laughter.)\nBut we had tremendous success on \"The Apprentice.\"  And when I ran for President, I had to leave the show.  That’s when I knew for sure I was doing it.  And they hired a big, big movie star -- Arnold Schwarzenegger -– to take my place.  And we know how that turned out.  (Laughter.)  The ratings went right down the tubes.  It’s been a total disaster.  And Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again.  And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, okay?  (Laughter.)\nBut we’ve had an amazing life together, the last 14, 15 years.  And an outstanding man, and thank you very much for introducing me.  Appreciate it.  It’s a great honor.  (Applause.)\nI also want to thank my dear friend, Vice President Mike Pence, who has been incredible.  (Applause.)  And incredible wife, Karen.  And every time I was in a little trouble with something, where they were questioning me, they’d say, but he picked Mike Pence -- (laughter) -- so he has to know what he’s doing.  And it’s true, he’s been -- you know, on the scale of 0 to 10, I rate him a 12, okay?  So I want to thank you.  Thank you very much.  Apprentice it.  (Applause.)\nBut most importantly today, I want to thank the American people.  Your faith and prayers have sustained me and inspired me through some very, very tough times.  All around America, I have met amazing people whose words of worship and encouragement have been a constant source of strength.  What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never, ever fail to touch my heart.  That’s:  “I am praying for you.”  I hear it so often -- “I am praying for you, Mr. President.”  (Applause.)\nNo one has inspired me more in my travels than the families of the United States military, men and women who have put their lives on the line every day for their country and their countrymen.  I just came back yesterday from Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief William “Ryan” Owens, as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  Very, very sad, but very, very beautiful.  Very, very beautiful.  His family was there.  Incredible family, loved him so much.  So devastated -- he was so devastated.  But the ceremony was amazing.  He died in defense of our nation.  He gave his life in defense of our people.  Our debt to him and our debt to his family is eternal and everlasting.\n“Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”  We will never forget the men and women who wear the uniform, believe me.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  From generation to generation, their vigilance has kept our liberty alive.  Our freedom is won by their sacrifice, and our security has been earned with their sweat and blood and tears.  God has blessed this land to give us such incredible heroes and patriots.  They are very, very special, and we are going to take care of them.  (Applause.)\nOur soldiers understand that what matters is not party or ideology or creed, but the bonds of loyalty that link us all together as one.  America is a nation of believers.  In towns all across our land, it’s plain to see what we easily forget -- so easily we forget this -- that the quality of our lives is not defined by our material success, but by our spiritual success.  I will tell you that.  And I tell you that from somebody that has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success -- the most material success.  Many of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people.  And I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families, they have great faith.  They don’t have money -- at least not nearly to the extent -- and they’re happy.  Those to me are the successful people, I have to tell you.  (Applause.)\nI was blessed to be raised in a churched home.  My mother and father taught me that to whom much is given much is expected.  I was sworn in on the very bible from which my mother would teach us as young children.  And that faith lives on in my heart every single day.\nThe people in this room come from many, many backgrounds.  You represent so many religions and so many views.  But we are all united by our faith in our Creator and our firm knowledge that we are all equal in His eyes.  We are not just flesh and bone and blood.  We are human beings, with souls.  Our Republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God.  (Applause.)\nIt was the great Thomas Jefferson who said, “The God who gave us life, gave us liberty.”  Jefferson asked, “Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?”\nAmong those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs.  That is why I will get rid of, and totally destroy, the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.  I will do that -- remember.  (Applause.)\nFreedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us, and the world is under serious, serious threat in so many different ways.  And I've never seen it so much and so openly as since I took the position of President.  The world is in trouble, but we're going to straighten it out.  Okay?  That's what I do.  I fix things.  We're going to straighten it out.  (Applause.)  Believe me.  When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don’t worry about it.  Just don’t worry about it.  (Laughter.)  They're tough.  We have to be tough.  It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks.  We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually.  It's not going to happen anymore.  It's not going to happen anymore.\nWe have seen unimaginable violence carried out in the name of religion.  Acts of wanton slaughter against religious minorities.  Horrors on a scale that defy description.  Terrorism is a fundamental threat to religious freedom.  It must be stopped, and it will be stopped.  It may not be pretty for a little while.  It will be stopped.  (Applause.)\nWe have seen -- and, by the way, General, as you know, James \"Mad Dog\" -- I shouldn’t say it in this room -- Mattis.  Now, there's a reason they call him \"Mad Dog Mattis\" -- he never lost a battle.  Always wins them and always wins them fast.  He's our new Secretary of Defense who will be working with Rex.  He's right now in South Korea, going to Japan, going to some other spots.  And I'll tell you what, I've gotten to know him really well.  He's the real deal.  We have somebody who's the real deal working for us, and that's what we need.  So, you watch.  You just watch.  (Applause.)  Things will be different.\nWe have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered and oppressed by ISIS killers.  We have seen threats of extermination against the Jewish people.  We have seen a campaign of ISIS and genocide against Christians, where they cut off heads.  Not since the Middle Ages have we seen that.  We haven’t seen that, the cutting off of heads.  Now they cut off their heads, they drown people in steel cages.  Haven’t seen this -- I haven’t seen this.  Nobody has seen this for many, many years.\nAll nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.  All nations have a duty to work together to confront it and to confront it viciously, if we have to.  So I want to express clearly today to the American people that my administration will do everything in its power to defend and protect religious liberty in our land.  America must forever remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected, and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  We have to feel safe and secure.\nIn recent days, we have begun to take necessary action to achieve that goal.  Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world.  But these are those and there are those that would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear.  We need security.  There are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle.  Not right.  We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation.  You look all over the world and you see what's happening.\nSo in the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty, and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination.  We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values -- not to hate us and to hate our values.  We will be a safe country.  We will be a free country.  And we will be a country where all citizens can practice their beliefs without fear of hostility or fear of violence.  America will flourish as long as our liberty and, in particular, our religious liberty is allowed to flourish.  (Applause.)\nAmerica will succeed as long as our most vulnerable citizens -- and we have some that are so vulnerable -- have a path to success.  And America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God.  (Applause.)\nThat faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and to lock arms at home, to ensure equal rights for every man, woman and child in our land.  It's that faith that sent the pilgrims across the oceans, the pioneers across the plains, and the young people all across America to chase their dreams.  They are chasing their dreams.  We are going to bring those dreams back.  As long as we have God, we are never, ever alone.  Whether it's the soldier on the night watch or the single parent on the night shift, God will always give us solace and strength and comfort.\nWe need to carry on and to keep carrying on.  For us here in Washington, we must never, ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to his will.  That's why -- (applause) -- thank you.  That's why President Eisenhower and Senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather together 64 years ago to begin this truly great tradition.  But that's not all they did together.  Let me tell you the rest of the story.  Just one year later, Senator Carlson was among the members of Congress to send to the President's desk a joint resolution that added \"under God\" to our Pledge of Allegiance.  That's a great thing.  (Applause.)  Because that's what we are and that is what we will always be, and that is what our people want:  one beautiful nation, under God.\nThank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n9:30 A.M.

COLLAMORE:  More than one.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have a lot of them.  I have a lot.  You've been great friends and supporters and appreciated for, number one, the election.  And I appreciate all of the help in deciding who to pick for the United States Supreme Court.  And, Leonard, you were fantastic.  All of you were.  And Jim DeMint -- I don't know if Jim is here or not but they were great, Heritage.  You really did.  You really helped.  And the rollout has been fantastic.  I don't know how anybody can oppose him, frankly.  I don't know how anybody can oppose him at all, but it really has been a beautiful thing to see.\nSo we had a very successful event.  He's a terrific person, by the way.  I got to know him reasonably well before we did the announcement, and he is just a spectacular man.  I think he will be a spectacular -- you know, you tell me, how would they go about -- Leonard, how would they go about opposing him?  He's perfect in almost every way.  But they'll look for the \"almost,\" right?  They'll say, what's the \"almost?\"\nMR. LEO:  He's got an impeccable record.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, Federalist really -- they really did a great job.  So we're going to be talking about working with the judge and maybe making this a fast process.  And nominating a justice of the Supreme Court is one of the most important things that I can do as President.\nI've always said this -- as I watched Presidents -- I'd say the most important thing.  And I think I want to refine that a little bit.  I think probably defense of our country might be now -- you know, it's -- otherwise we don't need the Supreme Court so badly, right?  We're doing well in that regard, very well.  I think we have problems that are a lot bigger than people understood.  I think I was left something isn't -- had a lot of problems, but I think we'll straighten out those problems.  I think we'll straight them out very strongly.\nJudge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified person from the standpoint of experience and education.  Columbia with honors, Harvard Law School with honors, Oxford at the highest level.  Great, great student, great intellect.  Supreme Court Justices White and Kennedy he clerked.  And so I just think it's really great that we're having this meeting, because we want to have him go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process.  Because they're very demeaning on the other side and they want to make you look as bad as possible.  And, of course, the press can be very demeaning too, but I'm sure the press will be very dignified in this case.\nBut I really want -- that's the word -- I really think he's a very dignified man.  I'd like to see him go through a dignified process.  I think he deserves that.  And hopefully it will go quickly and we'll see what happens.\nSo what we might do is -- just before they leave -- we might ask for the folks in the room just to give yourself a quick -- your name and a little introduction.  And, Wayne, I would say they know you.  Perhaps they know you better than they know me.  (Laughter.)\nMR. LAPIERRE:  I doubt that.  Wayne LaPierre, National Rifle Association.\nMS. NANCE:  I'm Penny Nance.  I'm the CEO and president of Concerned Women for America.\nMS.

DUGGAN:  I'm Juanita Duggan with the National Independent Business Association, NFIB.  Thank you.\nMR. COLLAMORE:  Tom Collamore with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Mr. President, congratulations on the fantastic nomination.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.\nMR. NORQUIST:  Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform.  And thank you for winning the election.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMR. LEO:  Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society.\nMS. DANNENFELSER:  Margorie Dannenfelser, the Susan B. Anthony List.\nMR. BLACKWELL:  Morton Blackwell, the Leadership Institute.\nMR. O'STEEN:  David O'Steen, National Right to Life.  Thank you for such a quick, expert nomination.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nMS. WHITE:  Paula White, Chairman of the Evangelical Advisory Council.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Paula.  Thank you for the help during the campaign.\nSo, with that, I'll ask you to all hit the road.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Mr. President, as you pointed out last night, the judge was confirmed on a unanimous voice.  Well, he's -- can I ask a question, Mr. President?  You all right?  Thank you.  As you pointed out last night, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed on a unanimous voice vote in 2006.  Now, a number of Democrats say they are going to oppose him.  What would you say to those Democrats?  And would you encourage Senator McConnell to invoke the nuclear option if he feels he can't get 60 votes?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think there's a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote from not very long ago.  And he did get a unanimous endorsement, and he's somebody that should get it.  I mean, you can't do better from an educational, from an experience, from any standpoint.  A great judge; he'll be a great justice.\nSo, no, I feel that it's very dishonest if they go about doing that.  And, yes, if we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President Obama, a lot longer than eight years -- but if we end up with that gridlock, I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear.  Because that would be a absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web.  So I would say it's up to Mitch, but I would say go for it.\nEND\n11:50 A.M.

Bush.  And your tenure at the department was widely lauded and continues to be celebrated as among the most significant in the history of that department.\nPrior to that you were actually deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation and chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.  And you bring a wealth of experience now to leading this department in the Trump administration.  Your significant experience in the private sector, ranging from business to nonprofits; your history of service and your accomplishments are lengthy.  And I know the President is grateful for your willingness to step forward and bring your extraordinary talents to bear serving the country once again.\nPresident Trump and I are appreciative that once again you have answered the call to serve America and advance the interests of the people of this country.  Your leadership and your experience will serve well as the Secretary of Transportation, overseeing what we anticipate will be historic investments in our nation’s roads, bridges, airports, and above all, in our future.  The President and I are confident that you will do more than your share as our new Secretary of the Department of Transportation to make America great again.  And we thank you.  (Applause.)\n(The oath is administered.)  (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-01-31T00:00:00", "title": "Remarks of Vice President Pence - As Delivered at the Swearing-in Ceremony for Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao"}

Trump: “Thank you very much.  I am honored to have Prime Minister Theresa May here for our first official visit from a foreign leader.  This is our first visit, so -- great honor.\nThe special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace.  And, by the way, my mother was born in Scotland -- Stornoway -- which is serious Scotland.\nToday, the United States renews our deep bond with Britain -- military, financial, cultural, and political.  We have one of the great bonds.  We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship.  Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law.  That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination.  A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.\nBoth America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.\nMadam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business and foreign affairs.  Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.\nOn behalf of our nation, I thank you for joining us here today.  It’s a really great honor.  Thank you very much.”\nPrime Minister Theresa May: “Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  And can I start by saying that I’m so pleased that I’ve been able to be here today.  And thank you for inviting me so soon after your inauguration.  And I’m delighted to be able to congratulate you on what was a stunning election victory.\nAnd, as you say, the invitation is an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries -- a relationship based on the bonds of history, of family, kinship and common interest.  And in a further sign of the importance of that relationship, I have today been able to convey Her Majesty The Queen’s hope that President Trump and the First Lady would pay a state visit to the United Kingdom later this year.  And I’m delighted that the President has accepted that invitation.\nNow, today, we're discussing a number of topics, and there’s much on which we agree.  The President has mentioned foreign policy.  We're discussing how we can work even more closely together in order to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamist extremism wherever it’s found.\nOur two nations are already leading efforts to face up to this challenge, and we’re making progress with Daesh losing territory and fighters, but we need to redouble our efforts.  And today, we are discussing how we can do this by deepening intelligence and security cooperation and, critically, by stepping up our efforts to counter Daesh in cyberspace.  Because we know we will not eradicate this threat until we defeat the idea -- the ideology that lies behind it.\nOur talks will be continuing later.  I’m sure we’ll discuss other topics -- Syria and Russia.\nOn defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense.  And today, we’ve reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance.  Mr. President, I think you said -- you confirmed that you’re 100 percent behind NATO.  But we’re also discussing the importance of NATO continuing to ensure it is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyber warfare as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.\nAnd I’ve agreed to continue my efforts to encourage my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitments to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense so that the burden is more fairly shared.  It’s only by investing properly in our defense that we can ensure we’re properly equipped to face our shared challenges together.\nAnd finally, the President and I have mentioned future economic cooperation and trade.  Trade between our two countries is already worth over $150 billion pounds a year.  The U.S. is the single-biggest source of inward investment to the UK, and together we’ve around $1 trillion invested in each other’s economies.  And the UK-U.S. defense relationship is the broadest, deepest, and most advanced of any two countries sharing military hardware and expertise.  And I think the President and I are ambitious to build on this relationship in order to grow our respective economies, provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the UK.\nAnd so we are discussing how we can establish a trade negotiation agreement, take forward immediate, high-level talks, lay the groundwork for a UK-U.S. trade agreement, and identify the practical steps we can take now in order to enable companies in both countries to trade and do business with one another more easily.\nAnd I’m convinced that a trade deal between the U.S. and the UK is in the national interest of both countries and will cement the crucial relationship that exists between us, particularly as the UK leaves the European Union and reaches out to the world.\nToday’s talks I think are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship.  And I look forward to continuing to work with you as we deliver on the promises of freedom and prosperity for all the people of our respective countries.”", "timestamp": "2017-01-27T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump and Prime Minister May's Opening Remarks"}

Our President is a man with broad shoulders and a big heart. His vision, his energy, and his optimism are boundless, and I know he will Make America Great Again.\nFrom his first day in office, he has been keeping his promises to the American people.\nAnd at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we’re in the promise-keeping business.\nThat’s why, on Monday President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy to prevent foreign aid from funding organizations that promote or perform abortions.\nThat’s why this administration will work with Congress to end taxpayer funding for abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health-care services for women across America.\nAnd that’s why, next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.\nLife is winning in America. And today is a celebration of the progress that we have made in the cause.\nYou know, I have long believed that a society can be judged by how we care for our most vulnerable – the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.\nWe’ve come to a historic moment in the cause of life, and we must meet this moment with respect and compassion for every American.\nLife is winning in America for many reasons.\nLife is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins.\nLife is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and homes to children in need.\nLife is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who minister to women, in cities and towns across this country.\nAnd life is winning through the quiet counsels between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables, and over coffee on college campuses the truth is being told and compassion is overcoming convenience, hope is defeating despair.\nIn a word, life is winning in America because of all of you.\nSo I urge you to press on.\nBut as it is written, “let your gentleness be evident to all.” Let this movement be known for love, not anger – for compassion, not confrontation. When it comes to matters of the heart, there’s nothing stronger than gentleness.\nI believe we will continue to win the hearts and the minds of the rising generation if our hearts first break for young mothers and their unborn children and we do all we can to meet them where they are, with generosity, not judgment.\nTo heal our land and restore a culture of life we must continue to be a movement that embraces all and cares for all out of respect for the dignity and worth of every person.\nEnshrined on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial are the words of our third president, who admonished us to remember that “God who gave us life gave us liberty.”\nOn behalf of the President of the United States, and my little family, we thank you for your stand for life, for your compassion, for your love for the women and children of this nation.\nBe assured, we will not grow weary. We will not rest until we restore a culture of life for ourselves and our posterity.\nGod Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-27T00:00:00", "title": "March for Life Remarks of Vice President Pence - As Prepared for Delivery"}

with you today and to have the opportunity to introduce at his first event, on his first full day, the new President of the United States, Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAs you can imagine, it's deeply humbling for my family and I to find ourselves in this role.  I'm grateful to our new President for the opportunity he's given me and the opportunity the American people have given us to serve.  But it's especially humbling for me to be before all of you today -- men and women of character, who have sacrificed greatly -- and to stand before this hallowed wall, this memorial wall, where we remember 117 who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.\nI can assure you this new President and our entire team recognizes and appreciates the sacrifices of all of the men and women of the intelligence community of the United States of America.  (Applause.)\nI've gotten to know our new President.  We traveled a lot together.  When the cameras are off and the -- lights are off, I'll tell you two things I know for sure.  Number one, I've never met anyone more dedicated to the safety and security of the people of the United States of America, or anyone who is a greater strategic thinker about how we accomplish that for this nation.  In fact, to understand the life of our new President is -- his whole life was strategy.  He built an extraordinary success in the private sector, and I know he's going to make America safe again.  (Applause.)\nAnd lastly, I can honestly tell you, for all my years serving in the Congress, serving as governor of my home state, traveling cross-country and seeing the connection that he's made to men and women who serve and protect in every capacity in this country, I've never met anyone with a greater heart for those who every day, in diverse ways, protect the people of this nation through their character and their service and their sacrifice.\nAnd so let me say, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce all of you the President of the United States.  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I want to thank everybody.  Very, very special people.  And it is true, this is my first stop, officially.  We're not talking about the balls, or we're not talking about even the speeches -- although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday.  (Laughter.)  I always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely.  (Laughter.)\nBut I want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump.  There's nobody.  (Applause.)\nThe wall behind me is very, very special.  We've been touring for quite a while, and I'll tell you what -- 29?  I can't believe it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Twenty-eight.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, 28.  We got to reduce it.  That's amazing.  And we really appreciate what you've done in terms of showing us something very special.  And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people.  Very, very few people could do the job you people do.  And I want to just let you know, I am so behind you.  And I know maybe sometimes you haven’t gotten the backing that you've wanted, and you're going to get so much backing.  Maybe you're going to say, please don’t give us so much backing.  (Laughter.)  Mr. President, please, we don’t need that much backing.  (Laughter.)  But you're going to have that.  And I think everybody in this room knows it.\nYou know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it -- but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes.  We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military.  And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did.  (Laughter.)  But I would guarantee a big portion, because we're all on the same wavelength, folks.  (Applause.)  We're all on the same wavelength, right?  He knows.  It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we're on the same wavelength.\nBut we're going to do great things.  We're going to do great things.  We've been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we've ever fought.  We have not used the real abilities that we have.  We've been restrained.  We have to get rid of ISIS.  Have to get rid of ISIS.  We have no choice.  (Applause.)  Radical Islamic terrorism.  And I said it yesterday -- it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth.  This is evil.  This is evil.  And you know, I can understand the other side.  We can all understand the other side.  There can be wars between countries, there can be wars.  You can understand what happened.  This is something nobody can even understand.  This is a level of evil that we haven’t seen.  And you're going to go to it, and you're going to do a phenomenal job.  But we're going to end it.  It's time.  It's time right now to end it.\nYou have somebody coming on who is extraordinary.  For the different positions of \"Secretary of This\" and \"Secretary of That\" and all of these great positions, I'd see five, six, seven, eight people.  And we had a great transition.  We had an amazing team of talent.  And, by the way, General Flynn is right over here.  Put up your hand.  What a good guy.  (Applause.)  And Reince and my whole group.  Reince -- you know -- they don’t care about Reince.  He's like this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right?  We don’t have to talk about Reince.\nBut we did -- we had such a tremendous, tremendous success.  So when I'm interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly -- because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia.  Fantastic guy.  But I'd see six, seven, eight people for a certain position.  Everybody wanted it.\nBut I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met.  I didn’t want to meet anybody else.  I said, cancel everybody else.  Cancel.  Now, he was approved, essentially, but they're doing little political games with me.  He was one of the three.  Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved.  (Applause.)  And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group.  It was going to be the three of them.  Can you imagine all of these guys?  People respect -- you know, they respect that military sense.  All my political people, they're not doing so well.  The political people aren’t doing so well but you.  We're going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others.\nBut Mike was literally -- I had a group of -- what, we had nine different people?  Now, I must say, I didn’t mind cancelling eight appointments.  That wasn’t the worst thing in the world.  But I met him and I said, he is so good.  Number one in his class at West Point.\nNow, I know a lot about West Point.  I'm a person that very strongly believes in academics.  In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically -- was an academic genius -- and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual?  Trust me, I'm like a smart persona.  (Laughter.)  And I recognized immediately.  So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School.  And then he decided to go into the military.  And he ran for Congress.  And everything he's done has been a homerun.  People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him.  And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled -- right, Mike?  Because he said, I don’t want to lose this guy.\nBut you will be getting a total star.  You're going to be getting a total gem.  He's a gem.  (Applause.)  You'll see.  You'll see.  And many of you know him anyway.  But you're going to see.  And again, we have some great people going in.  But this one is something -- is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps -- you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important.  You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing.  And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful.  But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier.  And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly.  And that's what we have to do.  We have to start winning again.\nYou know, when I was young and when I was -- of course, I feel young.  I feel like I'm 30, 35, 39.  (Laughter.)  Somebody said, are you young?  I said, I think I'm young.  You know, I was stopping -- when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops.  Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop.  I feel young.\nWhen I was young -- and I think we're all sort of young.  When I was young, we were always winning things in this country.  We'd win with trade.  We'd win with wars.  At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, \"The United States has never lost a war.\"  And then, after that, it's like we haven’t won anything.  We don’t win anymore.  The old expression, \"to the victor belong the spoils\" -- you remember.  I always used to say, keep the oil.  I wasn’t a fan of Iraq.  I didn’t want to go into Iraq.  But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong.  And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil.  Now, I said it for economic reasons.  But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn’t have ISIS because that's where they made their money in the first place.  So we should have kept the oil.  But okay.  (Laughter.)  Maybe you'll have another chance.  But the fact is, should have kept the oil.\nI believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems.  We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don’t even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused.  So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent.\nAnd the reason you're my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media.  They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth.  (Laughter and applause.)  And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.  And I just want to let you know, the reason you're the number-one stop is exactly the opposite -- exactly.  And they understand that, too.\nAnd I was explaining about the numbers.  We did a thing yesterday at the speech.  Did everybody like the speech?  (Applause.)  I've been given good reviews.  But we had a massive field of people.  You saw them.  Packed.  I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field.  I say, wait a minute, I made a speech.  I looked out, the field was -- it looked like a million, million and a half people.  They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.  And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.  I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we're not going to let it rain on your speech.\nIn fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no.  The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops.  And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we'll go right through it.  But the truth is that it stopped immediately.  It was amazing.  And then it became really sunny.  And then I walked off and it poured right after I left.  It poured.  But, you know, we have something that's amazing because we had -- it looked -- honestly, it looked like a million and a half people.  Whatever it was, it was.  But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.  And I turn on -- and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field.  And it said we drew 250,000 people.  Now, that's not bad, but it's a lie.  We had 250,000 people literally around -- you know, in the little bowl that we constructed.  That was 250,000 people.  The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.  So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty.  And I think they're going to pay a big price.\nWe had another one yesterday, which was interesting.  In the Oval Office there's a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King.  And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill.  I think most of us like Churchill.  He doesn’t come from our country, but had a lot to do with it.  Helped us; real ally.  And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out -- the bust.  And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly.  And they wanted to know whether or not I'd like it back.  I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill.\nSo a reporter for Time magazine -- and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times.  I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine.  Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it's one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right?  (Laughter.)  I've been on it for 15 times this year.  I don’t think that's a record, Mike, that can ever be broken.  Do you agree with that?  What do you think?\nBut I will say that they said -- it was very interesting -- that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King.  And it was right there.  But there was a cameraman that was in front of it.  (Laughter.)  So Zeke -- Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down.  I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King.  But this is how dishonest the media is.\nNow, the big story -- the retraction was, like, where?  Was it a line?  Or do they even bother putting it in?  So I only like to say that because I love honesty.  I like honest reporting.\nI will tell you, final time -- although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in -- because I am coming back -- we're going to have to get you a larger room.  (Applause.)  We may have to get you a larger room.  You know?  And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won't have columns.  (Laughter.)  You understand that?  (Applause.)  We get rid of the columns.\nNo, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you.  There's nobody I respect more.  You're going to do a fantastic job.  And we're going to start winning again, and you're going to be leading the charge.\nSo thank you all very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you -- you're beautiful.  Thank you all very much.  Have a good time.  I'll be back.  I'll be back.  Thank you.\nEND\n3:40 P.M.

We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.\nEvery four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.\nToday’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.\nFor too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\nWashington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.\nPoliticians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.\nThe establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\nTheir victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\nThat all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.\nIt belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.\nThis is your day. This is your celebration.\nAnd this, the United States of America, is your country.\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.\nJanuary 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\nThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\nEveryone is listening to you now.\nYou came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\nAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.\nAmericans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.\nThese are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\nThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\nWe are one nation – and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\nThe oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\nFor many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;\nSubsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;\nWe've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;\nAnd spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\nWe’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.\nThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\nBut that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.\nFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\nFrom this moment on, it’s going to be America First.\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\nWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\nI will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\nWe will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams.\nWe will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\nWe will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\nWe will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\nWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\nWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\nThe Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.\nWhen America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\nThere should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.\nWe will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger.\nIn America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\nThe time for empty talk is over.\nNow arrives the hour of action.\nDo not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.\nWe will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\nA new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\nIt is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\nYou will never be ignored again.\nYour voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-20T00:00:00", "title": "The Inaugural Address"}
{"source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/press-gaggle-press-secretary-sean-spicer", "text": "The White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\nFor Immediate Release\nMarch 06, 2017\nJames S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:47 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Another quiet weekend.  (Laughter.)\nQ    You sure you don’t want to do this on camera?  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  The President signed a new executive order this morning that continues to protect the nation from terrorists entering into the United States, and a related presidential memorandum.  As we've always maintained, the executive order was fully lawful in the first place, and we would have won the related legal cases on the merits.  But rather than leave America’s security in limbo while the litigation dragged on, some estimates having that go up to potentially a year, the President acted to protect the national security by issuing a new executive order that addresses the court’s concerns, some of which merely involve clarifying the intent of the original executive order.\nAfter reviewing the facts and in thorough consultation with the Cabinet, the President had concluded these actions are necessary to protect the United States from those who, unfortunately, wish to do us harm.\nTwo areas that I want to highlight in the executive order.  There will be a 90-day suspension of travel to the United States by nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, during which time the Department of State and Homeland Security will conduct a review to determine how we can improve the screening process for foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States.\nThese six countries have been previously identified by Congress and the Obama administration as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism.  Specifically, Iran, Sudan and Syria have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism.  Libya is an active combat zone where violent extremist groups thrive in ungoverned territory.  Portions of Somalia have been a safe haven for terrorist groups.  Most countries don't even recognize the Somali documents.\nYemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the government and Iran-backed armed opposition.  Both ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and carry out hundreds of attacks.\nThese governments simply cannot or not adequately supply satisfactory information about their own nationals.  In the absence of adequate information from these governments, the President has had to act to protect the security of the American people.\nAfter the original executive order, Iraq’s government took steps to increase their cooperation with our immigration authorities and improve their vetting process, leading them to be removed from the list of countries covered by the temporary travel suspension.  We hope other countries will also take proactive action to ensure the security of all of our nations.\nThis is proof of both the need for and the effectiveness of the President’s actions.  There are a number of exceptions to this temporary travel suspension.  The order explicitly states that the suspension does not apply to, one, green card holders; two, foreign nationals currently in the U.S.; three, foreign nationals currently holding valid visas; four, foreign nationals who are dual citizens of a designated country traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country; and last, foreign nationals who have been granted asylum or admitted as refugees previously.\nThere will also be a temporary 120-day suspension of the United States refugees’ admissions program.  More than 300 people who have entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the FBI.  We must find a way to better screen refugee applicants to maintain the safety of our own communities.\nThis suspension will temporarily reduce the investigative burdens on the agencies that participate in our refugee program, allowing them to properly review and revise their standards and practices.\nIn regard to both of these provisions, the President places his full faith and trust in the experience and knowledge of his Secretary of State and his Secretary of Homeland Security.  This order makes it clear that they have broad authority to grant waivers based on their expert judgments.  This suspension does not apply to refugees already scheduled for travel by the Department of State, which is explicitly stated in the text of the executive order.  Additionally, this suspension does not treat Syrian refugees different than any other refugees.  It does not separately address the persecution of religious minorities, but does permit waivers in the cases of undue hardship.\nThis order was drafted in close consultation with the relevant agencies.  It also includes a delay-effective date of March 16th, giving those involved in its enforcement even more time to facilitate an orderly rollout.\nWe welcome those who come to our country wishing to contribute and share in our nation’s prosperity and wellbeing, but we cannot allow our immigration system to become a vehicle for admitting people who intend to do us harm.  It is the President’s solemn duty to protect the American people, and President Trump has taken an important step in securing our borders through this order.\nMoving on to today, the President had a full day of meetings with the Cabinet and members of his staff.  The President received his intelligence briefing this morning.  He had a call earlier with the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, where they discussed regional security challenges.  The Prime Minister thanked the President for his strong stance on anti-Semitism during his joint address to Congress last week.\nThe President had lunch with the Vice President, and, as I’m speaking to you now, he is beginning a meeting with the Secretary of State.  Later today, he’ll have meetings with his National Economic Council and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shulkin.  This evening, he’ll have dinner with OMD Director Mulvaney and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, where he will talk about the repeal-and-replace efforts regarding Obamacare.\nWith that, I’ll be glad to take a few questions.\nQ    Follow-up on the executive order?  Have you told --\nMR. SPICER:  John Roberts.\nQ    Thank you.  (Laughter.)  You told us -- I figured since it’s just a gaggle -- you told us many times that the President was going to continue with the case in Seattle federal court, yet paragraph 13 in the new EO says he’s going to revoke the original one.  What changed?\nMR. SPICER:  As you know, he met with his team over the weekend down in Mar-a-Lago -- general counsel, Secretary Sessions, Secretary Kelly, Stephen Miller, other members of the team -- where they discussed -- continued discussing the current executive order, as well as the strategy.  And they made a determination that it was best to pursue this track.\nAnd again, I think, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we continue to maintain that the order was fully lawful but there were some legal hurdles that we’d have to potentially cross in terms of enjoinment and things like that.\nSo it was discussed with the President Saturday, and he made a decision that this was how he wanted to proceed going forward, based on the advice and counsel of his team.\nQ    DOJ has informed the 9th circuit of the existence of the new executive order.  Will they move to dismiss the 48 cases that are facing that original order?\nMR. SPICER:  That’s a good question.  I know that there’s the issue of both the 9th circuit and then the other ones.  And I’ll have to get back to you on that.  I don’t know what posture they’re going to take, so we’ll go forward.\nMargaret.\nQ    I was just going to say, would you be able to let all of us --\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, yeah, I’m sorry.  Yeah, I’d be glad to let everybody know.\nQ    I’ve got a question too but I can wait until he’s finished, it’s fine.\nMR. SPICER:  John, are you done?\nQ    Oh, I’m done.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.  See how much nicer this is?  Margaret.\nQ    Oh, thank you.  Well, actually I’d like to move away from this subject to the other subject.\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    Is the President going to clarify what he meant when he accused President Obama and White House officials of doing wiretaps?  Is that what he meant, or did he mean that he thinks there were wiretaps that the FBI authorized?  And does he want to kind of, like, amend his previous statement?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the statement that we issued yesterday where -- President Donald J. Trump is requesting as part of the investigation of Russian activity that congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.  Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is continued.\nHe wants Congress to look into this.  I’ve spoken to the President again today.  He would ask that they, additionally, look into this issue of leaks of classified and other information coming from the government.  He believes that it undermines our national security and that Congress -- the intelligence communities in Congress, using their oversight authority, look into these pervasive leaks of national security -- of classified information.  So he would do that.\nI would note, it’s interesting that when you look at what former DNI Clapper said on “Meet the Press,” when he was asked if there was any evidence that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russian government while the Kremlin was working to influence the election, his quote was, “Not to my knowledge.”\nI think we’ve continued to see people who have been briefed and are aware of these stories that have existed -- Congressman Chairman Nunes of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton of the -- he’s on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, Marco Rubio -- you name it, on and on and on, have said that the information that they’ve been provided -- and this is -- I get it, there’s two separate issues here.  But I think on the first one, you saw over and over again the continued comments by people who are in the know or have been in the know on that situation saying that there was no knowledge.  Conversely, you saw former Attorney General Mukasey come out and talk about -- that it’s pretty clear that there was some sort of surveillance or wiretaps that had to have existed.\nAll that being said, I think that’s why the President is asking Congress, the intelligence committees to use their oversight authority to further understand what’s in this.\nI’m sorry.\nQ    And so --\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not sorry but I knew you --\nQ    No, no, no -- yeah.  Just before we move on -- okay, so for now, the President is not amending what he tweeted.\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    And Jim Comey, in the meantime, I guess wanted Justice to knock it down.  Has the President talked to Jim Comey?\nMR. SPICER:  I’ll be honest with you, I have not seen anything aside from another report based on anonymous sources that that actually happened.  So aside from anonymous sources saying that a conversation happened, I’m not aware that that occurred.  I don’t know that we’re aware that that occurred.  And I, frankly, don’t see anything on the record that show that that actually occurred.\nSo just to be clear, this is one of the problems that I think occurred in the whole first set of stories.  People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources say they do.  We have started to become a series of believing all of these stories, and yet -- I’ve addressed this in the past -- there’s nothing there to substantiate it.\nIn fact, all of the people, from -- I mean, Clapper’s comment, “Not to my knowledge.”  You saw Nunes, Rubio, all these senators and House members that have been briefed by the FBI coming out and saying, we have not seen anything, either.  At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous off-the-records.\nZeke.  Oh, I’m sorry --\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no, I just saw the top of a head.  Hallie, I’m going to get to you, don’t worry.  I’m sorry, that was my bad.\nQ    It’s okay, it’s all right.  So explain this to me, then.  You’re talking about not using anonymous sources.  What is, then, the sourcing for the President’s tweet on Saturday morning?\nMR. SPICER:  As I said, I think, look --\nQ    And does he believe it’s a FISA warrant.  Is it some other -- of surveillance?\nMR. SPICER:  It could be FISA.  It could be surveillance.  There’s no cameras, slow it down.\nQ    So he doesn’t know?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I think he has made it clear that there are continued reports that have been out there.  I’m not going to continue to -- I think the President made it clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this.  I think there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources.\nQ    But what sources --\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.  Sara, you’re not on camera.  You don’t need to jump in.  We’ll get to your question in turn.  Hold on.\nThe answer is, is that the President has made it clear he wants Congress to look into this.  And we’re encouraging the House and Senate intelligence committees to use their oversight capabilities and look into this.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Sean, does he not know whether -- what kind of surveillance it was?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that there’s no question that something happened.  The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever.  But there’s been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred.  And I think that that’s why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this.  And I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some of this happened without the existence of surveillance.\nQ    But when he published his tweet --\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    -- did he know what kind of surveillance?\nMR. SPICER:  All I’m telling -- like I said, I’m going to put a pin in this and say, the statement yesterday made it very clear that he wants House and Senate Intelligence Committee members to use their oversight authority to look into this situation.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Has the President ever said there’s hypocrisy and a double standard in the reporting of things?  For example, about alleged Russian involvement in U.S. elections, and then on the other hand, relatively little attention paid to the leaking of conversations with world leaders that are classified?  And does the leaking of his conversations with world leaders bother him and make him want to investigate that as well?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I mean, I think he is very concerned about that.  There is obviously information that affects national security that has been leaked out that concerns him.  I mean, it’s -- and I think when you’ve seen some of the leader calls being leaked out that are sort of congratulatory or not necessarily dealing with state secrets or national security, that’s one thing to seem -- but it gives you pause and concern to realize that, if you’re talking about something of national security, of something that affects two of our different economies or countries, that -- whether it’s China or North Korea, whether you’re actually talking to them or talking about them with another leader, that there is obviously concern that those calls are getting leaked out.  And I think that’s why the President is also now asking Congress to additionally use its oversight authorities to also look at those leaks and wonder why that’s happening.\nSo I think he is concerned.  I think we’ve said it several times before, and it’s obviously something that is of major concern.  And, frankly, when you recognize the potential that that could have on the safety of our country, it should give everyone pause.\nHallie.\nQ    Sean, two topics for you here.  I want to clarify some questions again from my colleagues.  Has the President spoken with the FBI director about the allegations he made Saturday morning, and does he have confidence in his FBI?\nMR. SPICER:  To the best of my knowledge, I’m almost 100 percent certain that he has not, but I’ve not specifically asked him.  I’m not aware that that occurred.  Obviously I’ll give myself -- and I’d be glad to get back, but I have not known that that existed.  So I’m giving myself the ability to get back to you on this, but I’m not --\nQ    And all of us.\nMR. SPICER:  And all of you.  We’re making a list.  But I am not aware that that actually happened.\nQ    And the confidence question.  Does he have confidence in his director?\nMR. SPICER:  There’s nothing that I have been told by him that would lead me to believe that anything is different than when it was prior.\nQ    And before I get to the second topic, a clarification here.  You’re talking about the President wanting to go to Congress, specifically on the wiretapping question, but this is information that is held by the executive branch.  So why would the President, if it’s information the executive branch has --\nMR. SPICER:  Because I think that there’s -- like, again, and I’m not going to -- I want to stay in my wheelhouse here.  But my understanding is, is that the President directing the Department of Justice to do something with respect to an investigation that may or may not occur with evidence may be seen as trying to interfere.  And I think that we’re trying to do this in the proper way, and that’s --\nQ    So his tweets about it -- sort of saying that this information exists does not --\nMR. SPICER:  That doesn’t interfere with an investigation.\nSo, Zeke.\nQ    Okay, the second topic was actually on the immigration executive order.  The President back in January tweeted about a one-week delay on the travel ban, would have let “bad dudes” enter the country.  This particular revised order doesn’t go into effect for another 10 days.\nMR. SPICER:  The 16th.\nQ    So what changed?  How does that under -- does that undercut your argument that the nation was at risk?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I would argue that the court kind of undercut our argument by not reading the U.S. code the way it’s intended to.  But I think we lost the element of surprise way back when we said we were going to issue a second executive order.\nQ    So that’s what it was about, the element of surprise?\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, absolutely.  I think we said at the beginning.  The whole reason that we did it in the way that we did was because if you -- started to telegraph it.  But I think that when we started talking about a second executive order a couple of weeks back, I think that that generally took away -- whether it was done on Friday or Sunday or Monday, it wouldn’t have mattered.  And people have been able to -- we have telegraphed what we’re doing for the last couple weeks.  We took that away, and the President, as you’ve seen, has been very methodical about making sure we’ve talked about this for the last week --\nQ    Since the --\nMR. SPICER:  Right, but talking about implementing it correctly.  And I think Saturday night, if you saw the group of individuals who were down in Florida sitting with him, this is part of that implementation process that we’ve been talking about, that we were continuing to tweak it, to get it ready to speed, overcome a lot of issues and concerns that had to get added in or out, and make sure that the government was properly -- but make no mistake, we lost the element of surprise back when we said -- when the court enjoined this in the 9th circuit, and then we had to go back to the drawing board and we talked about doing a second order.  That was the intent of it the entire time.  You lose that back then.\nZeke.\nQ    Going back to the previous topic, the President calling for Congress to investigate these specific issues.  Does that mean that the President is willing -- or is committing now to accepting the conclusions of these congressional investigations no matter what they say on anything?  So because he’s now calling for this investigation, he is now committing to accept the outcome?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I don’t think you would ever just blanketly say “I’m going to accept any outcome.”  That doesn’t matter what it is.  You can go to court and -- it doesn’t mean that you get found guilty or innocent that you’re accepting the outcome, it means that you’re agreeing that that’s a legitimate -- but I think we’re going to let Congress work its will.  I think if we have a problem with one of the conclusions, we’ll let it be known.\nBut I think that, for right now, the issue is, is that we think that that’s the appropriate place for this to be looked into.  And they have the resources, and they, themselves, have admitted that.\nAlexis.\nQ    Sean, can I ask two topics?\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    On this topic, let me just follow up.  If members of Congress pursue an investigation that looks into surveillance in the way the President would like them to, and he believes that that surveillance is potentially against the law, they would make recommendations to the executive branch to pursue and prosecute anyone responsible for that.  So their recommendations would come back to the Justice Department.  So to ask the question again, would the President accept the recommendations of the legislative branch that potentially laws were broken and that those accusations should come back to the Justice Department to investigate?\nMR. SPICER:  I think it’s hard to prejudge what they’re doing.  Obviously, the reason that he’s asking the House and Senate Intelligence Committee to go through this is because he thinks that they are the appropriate venues.  They have the appropriate staff to look at them, and I think it’s an appropriate way of having that separation of powers, if you will, where it’s not asking -- directing the Department of Justice to do something that they may or may not be the ones conducting.\nBut again, the reason I don’t want to give a blanket statement, Alexis, isn’t because I’m trying to prejudge it.  But I think that depending on a lot of things, you don’t want to say, we’re going to accept every single thing they do.  I think we definitely will have a lot of respect for what they do and what they look into, but I think to blanketly accept -- just say, we’re going to accept anything they say or do, might be a bit premature and not exactly the way to go.\nQ    And I had a healthcare question but before I do that, it was reported that the President was interested in having the White House Counsel pursue information that would help support the President’s argument that he may have been under surveillance.  Is it the case that the President has indeed asked Don McGhan to continue doing that?  Or is he dropping that and --\nMR. SPICER:  No, Don McGhan was never asked -- all Don Mcghan was ever asked to do was to review what options, if any, were available.  That’s it.  Just review internally and tell the President, this is what’s -- but we made very clear to anyone who asked -- and if you know Don and the team here -- these are unbelievably talented lawyers.  They’re very skilled in understanding their -- where the bounds are, and would understand that any type of interference would be -- it was an internal review of what options, if any, were available.  So it’s full stop.\nQ    And that was completed?\nMR. SPICER:  That guidance was made available to the President.\nQ    Okay.  Here’s my healthcare question.\nMR. SPICER:  It was also reported that the President’s desire for speed with the administration’s own Affordable Care Act replacement plan has kicked the ball to the OMB Director rather the HHS Secretary to complete that work and get it out this week.  Who is in charge of actually completing that?  Is it more now in the ball court of OMB rather than HHS?  Or are they working together?  How would you describe it, and is it still coming out this week?\nMR. SPICER:  I believe it is coming out -- I have every intention that it comes out this week.  But I think it’s a joint effort.  I think Secretary Price is obviously the lead; it’s HHS.  But Director Mulvaney, his time -- I mean, they’ve both served in the House and were champions of budget issues.  Obviously, there’s a huge budgetary impact on that, and his understanding of the budget, his role here, and, obviously, his understanding of Congress makes Director Mulvaney a great partner.\nSo it’s not a question of -- and this is the same issue that came up during the transition on trade.  I think we have an unbelievably talented team -- everybody from Robert Lighthizer, when he gets confirmed as the U.S. Trade Rep, you’ve got Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Peter Navarro here -- it’s not an either/or thing.  It’s I think bringing the best and the brightest together to get something through.\nObamacare and repealing and replacing it with something that’s more accessible, affordable, more innovative is not something that just has to land in one person’s hand.  It can be covered -- and I think there are great partners and great teammates.\nYes.\nQ    Yes, please, thank you, Sean.  I’m just wondering when you said that it’s pretty clear that there was some sort of intelligence or wiretaps and that that’s why we need to move forward with an investigation, is that based on people speaking on the record, or anonymous sources?\nMR. SPICER:  On the record.  I think General Mukasey was very much on the record when he came to that conclusion.  I think that when you -- anyway.  I will leave it to Congress to further follow up on that.\nQ    And one more, if I may.  The President has yet to announce the vast majority of his sub-Cabinet-level nominations, such as Ambassador to Japan.  Does the White House have a long-term timeline for all the rest of these nominations?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think that you should -- there’s a bunch of sub-Cabinet individuals and ambassadorships that should be coming out very soon.  One of the things that I think -- I’m glad you kind of gave me an opportunity to touch on personnel.  There was a report the other day that of, like, the 1,927 positions that -- someone went through, I think one of the things that people have to recognize is -- we talked about this a lot during the transition.  We had about 600 members of these beachhead teams that went in under a special hiring process -- that they’re able to be there for 120 days.  For the most part, most of those people transition into Schedule C positions.  It’s not a given.  It is not a default, meaning -- and I think we made it clear during the transition -- it’s not just if you showed up for the first 120 days you get to stay.  But sort of -- they were chosen specifically because of their understanding of the issue, their expertise or their desire to serve in that particular capacity.\nAnd so we actually -- when you actually look at the numbers, we are well ahead, if not on par with -- we’re well ahead of almost every modern administration.  I think we’re right on par with Obama ’08.  But you think about it, of the 1,927 or so positions, we’ve got over 600 of those individuals, and -- most of whom so far are looking like they’re fully going to convert to Schedule C.  But they are performing the duties that would be done by a Schedule C.\nSo when you look at the totality of what we’re doing, we were well ahead on the Cabinet.  And again, one of the other things is, you’ve got Congress still holding up the Cabinet getting appointed.  And so I think there’s a degree to which Senate Democrats, before we get a lot of stones thrown at us about where we are on the rest, they haven’t even finished the job at hand of getting the full Cabinet.\nJon Decker.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Two questions on the executive order.  With the first executive order, there was a lot of fanfare when the President signed that executive order; in the Oval Office today, not so much.  We didn’t see the President, no cameras, no pool.  Why didn’t he want to show us him signing this new executive order?\nMR. SPICER:  I tweeted a picture out.\nQ    That’s your picture, that’s not independent --\nQ    Well, I know -- from today.  Yeah, that’s your --\nMR. SPICER:  I know, I’m -- I think -- (laughter) -- there are three agencies that are dealing with -- to your point, we went through this.  We talked about the courts issue, we talked about this ad nauseam; the President got asked about it over and over again.  I think today was about the implementation of it, was about having the three Departments that are expressly named to implement this to talk about what they’re doing to implement it.  And I think they did a phenomenal job about it.\nAnd that’s what we wanted to highlight today, is the government getting it done.  And the way that the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State were implementing the measures that the President laid forth -- again, if you think about it, the principles of the executive order remain the same.  We looked at what the court said, we put together a thing -- we consulted with the relevant agencies and Departments.  We talked to Congress.  We had an extensive morning of briefings.  The call to the press lasted about an hour, I guess.\nAnd so we made sure that everybody knew what we were doing.  We sent them out to make sure that the American people could see what they were doing.\nAnd so I just want to be clear that I think we did a phenomenal job of rolling it out and making sure the American people saw the faces of the Departments that were instrumental in implementing it.\nI’m sorry, Jon, go ahead.\nQ    That’s all right.  The second one has to do with this idea of “element of surprise.”  With the first executive order and also with this one, there’s a 90-day temporary ban on residents entering this country from six predominantly Muslim countries.  What’s to stop a so-called “bad dude” from one of these countries from coming into the country on the 91st day, or the 92nd day?  Why 90 days?  Doesn’t that get rid of that element of surprise when you say --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think that -- no, but -- thank you, that’s actually an interesting question.  I think part of it is, is that we feel confident that during that 90-day period, the processes could be put in place.\nNow, remember, there’s two key things that are important.  Number one is these six countries are the ones that we don’t have the information currently that we feel comfortable -- and as I lifted off why -- I mean, there are some that literally are state-sponsors of terror.  And I think when you recognize -- I don’t think there’s any American that wants a country that is a state-sponsor of terror to be sending their individuals here without us properly vetting them.\nYou talk about Yemen, the documents that people use in Yemen are not accepted by a whole host of countries because they lack the integrity to ensure that they are not compromised.  And I think that there is a big difference in that, but we can -- at the end of that 90-day period, we can let a country off, we can expand the list of countries, we could indefinitely address the countries that are on the list, we could expand that list to other countries that aren’t on it.\nBut there’s two things that are happening.  One is, we’re putting a ban on those countries, the six that are named.  But two is, we’re looking at an entire -- at the rest of the entire world, and all of the procedures that we use to address all countries.\nAnd so at the end of that period, we could add countries.  We could subtract countries.  We could decide to indefinitely continue with one of the two -- one of the six, rather.  But if you look at the case of Iraq, after the first order, they stepped up with four very specific things that they did to ensure that people traveling from Iraq, we had certain things -- whether it be biometrics and others -- that let us ensure that people coming into the country, we felt confident in knowing that they were coming in.\nBut that’s an important thing.  It’s not just those six.  We’re looking at that time -- we’re dealing with those during that 90-day -- but we’re also looking at everybody else at the same period.\nKaitlan.\nQ    So why doesn’t the order prevent people who didn’t have visas by the day of the first order from coming in the country?  Because wouldn’t that safeguard from the people who went and got visas during this revision period?\nMR. SPICER:  I would just say I think that there’s appropriate steps that have been taken during that period to ensure that the homeland has been protected.\nGo ahead, I know you have another one.\nQ    Just one more question.\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.\nQ    Does the President think that Barack Obama himself wiretapped him, or someone in the administration?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m just going to say that as the President noted in his statement, we’re going to let Congress look into that and then we’ll get back to you -- we’ll discuss it after Congress comes with -- Erin.\nQ    Since the President contends that he and President Obama like each other, has he picked up the phone and called President Obama since the inauguration, or did he think about asking him directly before accusing him publicly?\nMR. SPICER:  I have not -- I’m not aware of whether or not they’ve talked.  I can ask and find out and get back to you.\nCecilia.\nQ    Does the fact that you’re rescinding this first executive order -- is it at all an admission that things just didn’t go right the first time around?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  I think the first executive order, we’ve made clear time and time again -- when you look at how the court adjudicated that, their facts were wrong.  Just in terms of how many people had come into the country, they based it off of several things that I think were not factually accurate.  I think we recognized that we could have been in litigation for up to a year on this, and that would have left the country exposed.\nAnd I think that that’s -- there is a goal here that we sought to achieve the first time that we have to maintain.  But by no means -- we 100 percent maintain that the executive order as initially drafted is completely constitutional and legal, and that what we’ve done is to do the best of our ability based on what the court --\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, it’s still Cecilia’s turn.\nQ    Thank you.  What about this issue of radicalization after people are here, which is what DHS raised in that report?  One of the examples that’s cited in the EO today is the Somali man, now, who came as a child and was radicalized here.  So what does this order do about that population of people?\nMR. SPICER:  The people that are here --\nQ    That are here, which is what -- the concern that DHS raised in this report, that said people -- the bigger concern is people who are here and are radicalized after the fact, not those that are here just stopping to --\nMR. SPICER:  I think that what we need to do -- this isn’t a one-stop shop.  I think that we have to look at this -- the entire problem.  This is one piece of the problem that we’re looking at to make sure that we keep the country safe.  It’s not a either/or, or only-this-then.  But I think you’re going to see a continuation of steps that the President takes to make sure that the country is protected.\nOne small correction that I’ve been made aware of, it’s Somalia, not Yemen, that the travel docs are not accepted.  So my apologies to Yemen.\nJeff, did you -- hold on.  Thanks.  Jeff.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  You’ve mentioned a couple times and referred a couple times today to DNI Clapper -- former DNI Clapper’s comments on -- over the weekend about Russia and the Trump campaign.  Are you encouraging people to take those comments seriously but not the comments where he said there was no wiretapping?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I’m just -- well, first of all, he also said that he wasn’t aware -- he couldn’t speak entirely when it came to wiretapping.  He said that he wasn’t aware of anything.  I take him at his word that he wasn’t aware, but that doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist.\nBut I also think that it’s interesting that the double standard that has existed for so long when it comes to -- you have these sources over and over again who have been briefed by the FBI that say, I was briefed, there’s nothing there.  You have Clapper saying, “Not that I’m aware of.”  And yet, we still have these stories over and over again citing anonymous sources.\nAt some point, you have to question how many times are you going to take “didn’t see anything there” before we start seeing these stories getting rewritten over and over and over again?  I think that is a valid question.  It’s interesting how everyone today is asking what sources we have, and yet we’ve been asking the same question about the sources for these anonymous sources and story after story for the last six months.  And it’s just, don’t worry, we have these trusted anonymous sources that may or may not be true.  And at the bottom of every story it has some kind of caveat that -- however there has been no formal evidence presented.\nI think there’s been a malignment for so many months about what may or may not have happened, and yet not a shred of single truth has actually come that shows any evidence that existed except for anonymous source after anonymous source after anonymous source.\nQ    On a different issue?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    What is the White House’s reaction to North Korea firing four ballistic missiles into the sea off of Japan’s northwest?\nMR. SPICER:  The launches are consistent with North Korea’s long history of provocative behavior.  The United States stands with our allies in the face of this very serious threat.  The Trump administration is taking steps to enhance our ability to defend against North Korea’s ballistic missiles, such as through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Africa -- South Korea.\nQ    I just want to circle back around to a couple things that you said.  You said it could be FISA, it could be surveillance.  So are you saying that the administration is conceding that somewhere there was evidence presented before a judge that shows there could be collusion with the campaign and that it was okay to surveil them?\nMR. SPICER:  No, what I'm suggesting is that, as I said, that our goal is to allow Congress to do its job, as the statement said yesterday.\nOlivier.\nQ    And then the follow-up on the new order.  You had said that there are a hundred or so that had been inspected, but how many total that came in that you all have detained.\nMR. SPICER:  It’s 300.\nQ    Of 300 -- 100 refugees?  You said hundreds of -- or 300 refugees.  How many total came in, and how many did you detain?\nMR. SPICER:  I'd ask you to talk to the Department of Justice -- actually, Homeland Security on that one.  I know the top-line stat on that one.\nOlivier.\nQ    A couple for you.  One, just scheduling.  The Israeli defense minister is in town tomorrow.  Will he meet with the President?\nMR. SPICER:  I'll have to get back to you on that.  I'm not aware that that's on the schedule at this time, but -- I don't know.  I know that he and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke earlier.  I'm not aware that that came up.\nQ    And can you flesh out this notion of 300 refugees being investigated?  What are they being investigated for, specifically?  What’s the source for this information --\nMR. SPICER:  The FBI.\nQ    So the FBI is investigating 300 refugees currently on U.S. soil on terrorism-related charges?\nMR. SPICER:  That's what I have been -- yes.  I'll get you the stat for that, but that's --\nQ    That would be great.  Thank you.\nMR. SPICER:  Anita.\nQ    Can you talk a little bit about Iraq and how they’re not -- why they’re not in the executive order anymore?  So is this a signal to the other six and to other countries that they can also get removed if they -- I think you called it “proactive,” if they were proactively having their own actions?\nMR. SPICER:  I think what I would say, and I think the way you phrased it is right.  It’s not just the six countries, it's countries throughout the globe.  I think that we are -- it is in every country’s best interest to know who’s coming in and out of its country and to do things.  And I think there are things that we've asked countries to do.  And it's not inclusive, it's not “have you hit these four.”  I think each country is a separate case.  So I don't want to say, “if you do these four you're in.”\nQ    But is it possible, then, to --\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  I think there is -- now, in some cases, like anything else, Anita, it may be easier for one country to achieve something than for another.  But at the end of the day, I think there are certain things that -- there are certain steps that Iraq went through, including things like biometrics and turning over lists of -- updating lists, rather, of people within their country that have -- that pose a threat.\nAnd so that -- they’ve agreed to do certain things after the first one was ordered that give us a much greater degree of confidence in knowing who is coming in and out of the country.\nQ    And then on another topic.  What was the President’s reaction to hearing about Vice President Pence’s email use, personal email for government business?  I ask, obviously, because he had so many things to say about Hillary Clinton using personal email for government business last year?\nMR. SPICER:  I was going to insert, like, an AOL joke here.  (Laughter.)\nBut I think, look, I don’t -- I think there’s a big difference.  The Vice President complied with Indiana law, turned over all of his emails and made sure that everything was done.  I mean, that’s a very big step.  There’s no question that I’ve been made aware of that he didn’t do everything in compliance with Indiana law.  There’s a big difference between doing what is common practice within a state government and what is in compliance with that state’s laws, then setting up a private server that seeks specifically to go around the government protocols and the Federal Records Act.\nThere’s a big difference between that.  But I mean, the governor at the time, and now the Vice President, did everything in compliance with Indiana law.  And I think that’s a big difference, is that it’s not a question of -- it’s a question of was there a law and was there a rule and did you follow it.  In the case of Governor Pence, he did.  In the case of Secretary Clinton, I would let the record speak for itself on that.\nSara.  Gabby, I’m sorry.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Part of the justification for the hurried rollout of the initial executive order on immigration was that if it wasn’t rolled out immediately, that people would take advantage of that and come into the country.  So why has the administration decided to delay the implementation of this new executive order until March 16th?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to refer you Hallie Jackson.  (Laughter.)  That was what Hallie asked earlier.\nQ    Sorry.\nMR. SPICER:  No problem, it’s in the -- but basically the answer that I gave Hallie that I’ll give to you is, I think the first order -- one of the goals of the first order was an element of surprise, to implement it in a way that didn’t allow people to get in, right?\nSince the 9th Circuit acted, we’ve been talking about a second executive order.  I think we lost the element of surprise back in mid- to early February when the 9th Circuit acted the way they did.  So that element -- what we’ve tried to do now is to make sure, with that element gone, that we’ve implemented this in a way that ensures the greatest degree of confidence that we know what we’re doing.\nOne quick item -- I’m not done, so don’t -- you can keep your hands -- someone asked earlier, and I’m trying to remember who, about the source for DOJ.  Was that you, Olivier?  The Department of Justice, FBI investigation, section one, subsection H, the text of the EO notes -- you can check on that for the source.\nI’m sorry.  Matt.\nQ    Thanks.  Sean, doubling back to something we talked about earlier.  President Trump accused President Obama of criminal conduct.  One, can you tell us what his source was for that accusation?  Two, can you tell us, unequivocally, that he was basing that on more than a talk radio report and a Breitbart article about that talk radio report?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to tell that -- I’ve said it over and over again, I think the President made it very clear in the statement yesterday that he is not going to comment any further on this until Congress does --\nQ    So maybe it was just based on the talk radio report?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not going to -- I’m just going to say that the President made it very clear that, based on numerous things, including -- and I think there’s a New York Times story on it, there’s several sources that made this clear or brought this to light -- but I’m not going to go into anything further, as the President noted, until this is resolved.\nMara.\nQ    I have two topics.  One, on the EO that maybe is coming later this week -- an EO on the Obama administration’s fuel-economy standards.  Are you going to have an EO reversing those, and will that also negate California’s waiver?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t see anything on -- I’ll have to get back to you, as my standard.  I’m not so sure on the timing -- I was just looking at my date.\nQ    Oh, okay.  Thank you.\nMR. SPICER:  But I’d just -- I wouldn’t get -- I don’t have anything to announce at the time, is generally how I answer that, and I’m going to stick to it.\nQ    Okay, but I have just one more question on the other topic.  You said that you pointed rightly to Clapper’s comments -- nothing that he knows of suggests there was any collusion between the campaign and Russia.  But he also said that he didn’t know of any wiretap FISA order.  Why are you willing to accept his --\nMR. SPICER:  That’s what Jeff asked.\nQ    Well, I guess the thing I’m asking is that the President of the United States has unilateral authority to declassify anything that he wants.  He said in his tweet, I just learned of this.  So he obviously had some kind of evidence.  Why not declassify it?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that’s -- as I have made clear, there’s a reason that we want Congress, the intelligence committees to do their job in terms of making sure that there’s a separation of powers.\nQ    He’s afraid it would look like interference?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that, again, I’m just going to leave it at that he thinks it’s appropriate for Congress to do this instead of trying to point to his own Department of Justice.\nAshley.\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, you’re going to wait your turn.  It’s Ashley’s turn.\nQ    Thank you.  This morning, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News and she said, “He’s the President of the United States.  He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.”  So that seemed to be referring not to these news reports you’re talking about, but to specific, tangible evidence.  So what can you tell us about what that evidence is, where it came from?  And then secondly, if he has this evidence, why is he asking Congress to investigate?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I just -- I think the point that Kellyanne was making at the time is that the President, because he’s President, gets access to NSC and other intelligence documents.  I don’t know -- I haven’t seen the exact transcript, so I can’t --\nQ    I can read it to you.\nMR. SPICER:  I appreciate that, thank you.  But I also haven’t talked to Kellyanne about it, so I don’t think you can do that part.  But I don’t -- so I can’t specifically respond to you in terms of what she was referring to, whether she was referring to the exact nature of his charge or whether, generally speaking, he is given information.\nBut again, on all of this, I’m going to go back to the statement earlier that the President’s goal right now is to make sure that House and Senate can do this -- yes.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  China is retaliating against the THAAD deployment in South Korea.  What is the U.S. position?\nMR. SPICER:  It’s retaliating against what?\nQ    Against the THAAD deployment in South Korea, THAAD battery deployment.\nMR. SPICER:  The THAAD battery?\nQ    Yes.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think we’re going to work with South Korea.  I mean, obviously, North Korea’s missile launches present a danger to our friends down south.  And I think, as I mentioned in our response, we’re going to continue to work with the government of South Korea to address this thing.\nQ    Would the U.S. -- the Chinese government?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not at this point -- huh?\nQ    -- the Chinese government?\nMR. SPICER:  We have not had any further conversations on this.  I think this is consistent with U.S. policy.\nMargaret.\nQ    Sean, two points of clarification.  Did the President mean in any way to suggest that the FBI broke the law, or any other intelligence agencies, with this allegation of wiretapping?\nMR. SPICER:  In the tweet?\nQ    Yes.\nMR. SPICER:  I’m just going to let the tweet speak for itself.  I’m not going to get into --\nQ    Well, that’s why I’m asking this question?\nMR. SPICER:  I get it, but I think that I’m not going to try to --\nQ    Because it opens that up.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that, and I think I will seek further clarification on that.  For right now, I would just suggest to you that I’m going to let it speak until I can get further clarification.\nQ    My second point of clarification here.  You said, you know, you didn’t want to really get into what the triggering event was for the tweet in the first place, but I want you to address this part if you would.  The question has been raised -- or the allegation has been raised that the President was simply trying to change the topic off of an unfortunate news cycle that week.  Can you address that portion of the question, that this was deliberately about changing the media narrative and not anything having to do with the story itself?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I don’t -- I mean, that’s -- I have nothing to lead me to believe that that was the case.  I’m not sure -- and I think he had a great week last week.  He had a phenomenal joint address.  We had a great visit down in Norfolk, talked about rebuilding the military.  He was in Orlando, in Florida, talking about how school choice can help children and parents and create better schools.\nSo I just -- I can’t say that I’ve talked to him specifically about this, but I think the President had a good week.  And so I don’t see any reason that he would be using -- I mean, that just -- I think it was an issue of concern to him.\nQ    Sean, let’s remind everybody what the President did tweet Saturday morning:  “Terrible!  Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory.”  He later called Obama a stupid guy -- or whatever it was exactly -- a sick guy.  Yeah, sorry.  Are the American people supposed to pull back and suddenly think that this is not the President of the United States accusing his predecessor of committing a crime when he writes it that way?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President speaks very candidly.  His tweets speak for themselves, as we’ve said before, and he’s asked the House and Senate committees to look into this.\nSara.\nQ    Considering the scrutiny surrounding President Trump’s then-campaign advisors and Russia, which has carried over at the White House, is he reconsidering at all his hope or his timeline for pairing with Russia to fight ISIS?\nMR. SPICER:  Is he -- based on --\nQ    Just based on the amount of scrutiny surrounding his --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I mean, I think if Russia wants to join with us to fight ISIS, that’s a great --\nQ    So nothing has changed on that front?\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    And secondly, in light of the fact that there were previously undisclosed communications between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, has White House counsel done anything proactively to try to go to senior staffers or other Cabinet-level officials and say, hey, if you have had contact with a Russian official that you have not previously disclosed, then now is the time to do it?\nMR. SPICER:  Not that I’m aware of.  I’m not aware of any of that.  I would say that there’s -- one of the things that is interesting that, you know -- in the course of people conducting their business here at the White House or during a transition or in the House or the Senate, you contact a whole host of people -- diplomats, government officials, you know, association representatives, corporate representatives.  I mean, that’s -- those are the kind of folks that talk to people in government.\nAnd I think that there’s one thing between talking with somebody -- I mean, I think -- and again, I’ll get back to you so don’t be prescriptive on this.  I think someone had told me earlier today that there were something like 20 visits to the Russian ambassador in the last, you know, 10, maybe, years.  I don’t -- huh?\nQ    Twenty-two.\nMR. SPICER:  Twenty-two.  Thank you for helping fact check me.  (Laughter.)\nQ    -- is not here, so somebody’s got to do it.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Where’s Knoller?  But I think at some point, there’s nothing wrong with people doing their job, right?  I mean, that’s what I think that there is a big difference between so-and-so met with someone.  There’s nothing to disclose with a meeting.  If I have a meeting with a member of the media, no one says, hey, did you know that you need to report every time you meet with this individual or this outlet or whatever.  There’s nowhere to report that kind of stuff.  There’s a big difference between doing something nefarious or illegal and conducting yourself in a routine course of business.\nQ    But there were clearly a number of instances where people in this administration suggested they did not have any contact or misled you guys about the amount of contact they had, which has then caused some unflattering news cycles.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, and I think -- so in one case, Michael Flynn was, you know -- the President said the inconsistencies and him not being straight with the Vice President -- he asked him to resign.  I think the President dealt with it.\nBut that was -- again, if you note the President’s comments at the time, he was very clear that the issue wasn’t that he’s doing his job.  The issue was him misleading the Vice President.  And that's a very different thing.\nSo he had no problem with him doing his job and contacting individuals that we were going to need to be in contact with during the administration.  And that's where I think there is a big difference between a lot of these stories saying, did you know that so and so did this?  There’s nothing wrong with people meeting with ambassadors, or government officials, or corporate representatives, or members of the media.  That's part of what we do in government.\nAnd so I think there’s a big difference in the question that you're asking about whether or not someone is doing something that's wrong and inappropriate or illegal, and someone doing what they would do in a normal course of business.\nQ    Well, I think the other question is just whether there have been more instances in this that are going to catch you guys by surprise since he --\nMR. SPICER:  And I guess --\nQ    -- the President himself has denied that there was any kind of this contact throughout the campaign, and then we found out there were national security --\nMR. SPICER:  But hold on.  Actually --\nQ    -- advisors you didn't mention meeting with the Russian ambassador as well as Jeff Sessions, and then there was this meeting with Michael Flynn, as well as Jared Kushner, which was not previously disclosed.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, so there’s two things.  You said the President found out about this.  What’s “this?”  Having a meeting?  Again, I don't think that -- there’s countless meetings that members of his senior staff and the rest of people throughout government have on it every day.  That's why he’s asked us to come here and work, is to facilitate some of these meetings and get some of this stuff done.\nThere is no one to disclose stuff to.  I don't disclose the --\nQ    That sounds like you're saying you're not concerned that they're --\nMR. SPICER:  No, it’s not that I’m not concerned.  I guess there’s -- but what I’m getting at, Sara, is that there’s a difference between being concerned about somebody -- I could equally be concerned that if a member of the media said, hey, I want to take a member of your staff out, and we're going to break some kind of ethics rule.  I would be concerned about that.  But I wouldn’t be concerned if they said, hey, we want to go have coffee with a member of the media.\nThey don't disclose all that on our staff.  And I think -- but that's essential to your question is, is a meeting -- there’s nothing wrong with a meeting.  There’s nothing wrong with meeting with a government official, or a diplomat, or a member of the media, or a corporate individual, or association, or a constituent, or a citizen that has an issue.  But on any of those categories, once they cross the line and do something wrong, and I think to the answer of your question, the issue was specifically -- or the question surrounded attempts to influence the election.  Those are very different than people meeting also during a transition period, or people meeting in their White House capacity.  But those are three separate instances.\nAll of the stories that I’ve heard so far, previously all detailed just action with respect to the campaign and Russia’s attempt to influence the campaign, right?\nQ    Yes, I mean, I think --\nMR. SPICER:  Yes, I mean that's --\nQ    That was the backdrop.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  That's the backdrop.  And then -- and so I think in the one instance where it happened where there was someone that misled someone, they were let go.\nSo for you to start asking questions about, well, what if these other individuals had a meeting?  Well, were they ever asked about it?  I mean there’s a big difference between did someone meet with someone; and did someone mislead somebody about meeting someone.  And that is a very, very big difference in those questions.\nAnd that's one of the things that I think is important to distinguish.  People can meet with people.  The question is did they do something wrong.  Did they mislead somebody?  And those are all very, very different categories.\nApril.\nQ    Okay, Sean, I have a couple of topics.  And back on this following up, so the question is:  Under what capacity was he in when he met with the ambassador?  And what did they talk about?\nMR. SPICER:  Who is he?\nQ    Sessions.\nMR. SPICER:  I don't know.\nQ    And then under -- then when he was under oath, he said he didn't do it.  But then we find out later, so what do you say --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no.  Well, first of all, I’m not going to -- I’ll refer you back to the Department of Justice.  I know -- my understanding is he’s amending his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee from what I’ve heard.  So I’ll let his people -- but I do think that his explanation that he gave was very -- was that he was answering a question did you have any meetings with anyone with respect to the campaign.\nAnd I think in his mind, it was very clear that, I never met with anybody with respect to the campaign.  I met with someone in my Senate office, in my capacity as a United States senator, with Senate staff to discuss foreign policy or whatever it was that he was discussing.\nI think the Senator discussed this in his media conference last week Thursday.  So I don't -- I guess the issue is with respect to what was talked about, I don't know.  That's up to him.\nBut I do think the way he described it was very clear that he believed he was answering Senator Franken’s question with respect to activity involving the campaign and attempts to -- as I said to Sara, like this whole idea of influencing the election.  Meeting with an ambassador about an area of foreign policy in his Senate office with his Senate staff was clearly not a campaign event.\nQ    Okay, so now on the leak issue.  You're talking about Congress doing an investigation.  But some of these leaks are coming from top officials, people who know insider information.  What has the President said to his staff as it relates to the leaks in reference to trying to find out himself, not just from top-level people, what has he said to people about the leaks, about trying to stop it, or trying to find out what’s happening?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President made clear in his comments when he stood before you all a couple weeks ago that his main concern is national security.  That's -- when he keeps talking about the leaks, his concern is the leaks that damage and undermine national security, the leaks that deal with classified and other information.  That's what his main concern is.  And I don't think -- that's not a White House issue.  That's sort of -- that is an issue that is beyond the White House.  We're not --\nQ    Other leaks don't matter, but the national --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, I think -- it’s not that other leaks don't matter.  I think his issue that he has talked about and his concern is the leaks of national security.  It’s not that he’s saying, other leaks are okay.\nBut I think the ones that threaten our public safety or potentially put our country in harm are the ones that he really cares about.\nPeter.\nQ    I have a question.  I’m sorry.  This President reached out to former President Obama several times when he was President.\nMR. SPICER:  That's right.\nQ    They started building something.  There was a bridge.  Now some people in the Obama camp are considering these conversations about, or these tweets crazy.  And the question is now:  With this divide between these two, and President Trump may need to one day reach back to former President Obama, how do you think that will play out?  Do you think that these two will never come back together again?  Is this something he could have talked to him about before he went on Twitter?  There is now a chasm.  There’s a divide that wasn’t there a couple of weeks ago.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, well, there was a divide during the campaign, too.  I don't think that -- I think that, as you saw, and the President has made it very clear, he said some things about the President.  And the President said stuff -- about the campaign.  I think they came together for the good of the country.  And in cases where they can come together for a common good and to talk about what’s in the country’s best interests, they will.\nBut I understand your point.  I just think the President --\nQ    Did he burn a bridge?\nQ    Hold up, hold on.\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  But I think that they’ll be just fine.  So go ahead.  That's you.\nQ    Oh, good.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    Hi, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  Hi, Julie.  You've been very patient.\nQ    Yes, I have.  Thanks.\nMR. SPICER:  I think it’s your first time.\nQ    It is, yes.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, welcome.  See how pleasant this is?\nQ    I was feeling like how can I not get called on my first time?  Ten years ago, Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran.  And I know the President talked about this a little bit on the campaign trail.  Is there anything you can tell us about how the administration is approaching this case?  Have they been in communication with his family or any updates on that?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we put out a statement from the NSC on Friday on this -- Victoria.  I think we -- so we have been in communication with his family.  I believe they were here -- or we were in touch with them last week.  And obviously, we continue to hold out hope.  But the administration has been in touch with his family.\nQ    Sean, the call to Netanyahu, what prompted that?\nMR. SPICER:  I don't know, Dave.  I’ll find out.  I just know it happened.  And I got a little bit of a --\nQ    As you might know, the Prime Minister is meeting later this week with Vladimir Putin.  Did the President and the Prime Minister talk about Syria at all?\nMR. SPICER:  I don't know.  I know that they had a discussion about regional threats, so I don't want to get ahead of this.\nDavid Jackson.\nQ    Comey did tell people this weekend that President Obama did not order these wiretaps, and he did want the Justice Department to put out that statement.  Does President Obama believe --\nMR. SPICER:  Are you -- like I said, I am not -- wait, so --\nQ    Does President Trump believe Comey when he says that President Obama did not authorize these wiretaps?\nMR. SPICER:  My question is, is that I don't think that we've confirmed that Director Comey did say that.  I don't -- I’m not aware.  Aside from reading stories that cite anonymous sources saying that he did, I’m not aware that that actually happened.  So that's the first issue that I think we need to resolve.\nQ    Well, people we trust did tell us that he did.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, with all due respect, not you, but I think that we've had a number of reports that I’ve seen that -- about things that have occurred in the last 40-some-odd days that actually didn't occur, but anonymous sources said they did.\nPeter Alexander.\nQ    Sean, to be clear, you said earlier as an on-the-record source for the President’s wiretapping claims, he referred to the former Attorney General Michael Mukasey.  I just want to ask you to clarify if you could because his public comments were on Sunday, a day after the President tweeted about this.   And even in his public comments, he said that he based his information “on news reports.”\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.  But I’m just saying that he is -- someone asked whether it was an on-the-record comment.  And that is on the record.\nQ    But I was saying, was there an on -- you were being asked was there an on-the-record comment in advance of the President’s tweets to which he was basing his information?  Did he have anything better than anonymous sources?\nMR. SPICER:  I don't -- I’m not -- as I said before, I’m not going to get into the elements of that.  I’ll just -- I’m going to wait until the House and Senate.\nQ    Really, just on a past comment that the President had made about the suggestion that there were -- or the claim, in fact, that there were 3 million to 5 million people who voted illegally in this country -- he made this claim more than a month ago.  I just want to get a sense now on the update on any investigation into that and where it stands, given the explosive nature of such a claim.\nMR. SPICER:  I think we’ve touched on this, but he has asked Vice President Pence to lead a task force on this.  We have -- I'll get more for you.  I know that there’s been some discussion with some Secretaries of State and others on some of this.  I know you had that issue in Texas come -- last week, and I'm trying to remember the exact nature of it, but there has been now further evidence that people have voted illegally.  And I think that one of the things the task force is looking to do is to gather additional information of what -- it's still in the process of getting the task members named.\nQ    Does the task force, I guess, exist yet?  Or is --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, the Vice President has been talking to folks potentially to serve on it, and I know that several Secretaries of State have expressed --\nQ    It hasn't convened yet, but he’s been talking to folks about it.\nMR. SPICER:  That's correct.  That's correct.\nQ    Sean, two subjects here, following up on the wiretap question.  Stepping away from what the President knew or the basis of his tweets, how appropriate is it for a President to make an explosive charge as fact and then send you folks out to step away and say this maybe happened and we should investigate it?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think there’s two things.  One is the President’s tweets speak for themselves.  We're making that very --\nQ    But --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  And I think the President has been very clear, as we've stated, that I think there’s enough there that we want the House and Senate intelligence to use the resources they do to make sure that they look into this matter.  I mean, that's -- there is -- anyway, I do not want to get ahead of where they may go with this or what they may look at, but I'm going to leave it to them.  If we start down the rabbit hole of discussing some of this stuff I think then we end up in a very difficult place.\nI look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow.  If you can bring your cameras --\nQ    Sean, housekeeping-wise, you said that we’d get some clarification on a number of questions -- to all of us.  If you could do that today through the pool --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think we can try to do that through the pool.  If not, we'll write everything -- we generally write down everything and try to get back to the reporters.  So I will have the team -- and then get it out by the pool.\nQ    Will we be hearing from the President this week, since we didn’t today?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sure at some point we'll do either something that we -- a photo spray or something.  I think that we have a pretty good track record of making the President available to folks.\nQ    -- kind of unusual.\nMR. SPICER:  What’s unusual?\nQ    To not --\nMR. SPICER:  It's Monday.\nQ    Exactly.\nQ    But you see -- everything is closed.  Normally we have a photo spray or something.\nMR. SPICER:  I just -- I think that's -- don't give me this “normally we do.”  I made it very clear at the beginning of this, April, that we have some things on camera, some off.  Last week the President traveled two days, he had the joint session.  We briefed every single day --\nQ    It’s not about us, it’s about the American public seeing their President.  And we have to --\nMR. SPICER:  Wait, hold on.  Seeing their President.  The guy is in meetings all day.  I'm trying -- how many times did you complain about the President --\nQ    He signed executive orders.  You had us -- last week you said --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on.  He signed an executive order.  I mean, this is a President, when it comes to accessibility and allowing the press access, I think I've heard from several of you -- we have gone above and beyond allowing the press into events, into sprays.  We've had greater access.\nSo, with all due respect, I mean that's not been the case.  One day out of the last 41 or 40, whatever it's been -- but I think this President has been extremely accessible, extremely transparent, as far as -- he signed an executive order this morning that we then put all three Cabinet Secretaries that were relevant to implement this out.\nI'll be out tomorrow.  I think we have an opportunity -- look, I made it very clear from the beginning of this that we’d have a briefing every day.  We've gaggled every day, we've made ourselves available to you.  So, with all due respect, that's not a very accurate assessment of how we've been acting.\nThanks.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.\nEND\n2:50 P.M.

EST\nMS. SANDERS:  All right, I'll walk through -- I'll keep the opening quick since I know we're on tight time, but the President is going to spend his day here in Orlando, Florida, speaking with students, parents, teachers and administrators on how we can improve our education system and the importance of school choice.  We'll be at the St. Andrew Catholic School.  The President will then proceed to Palm Beach for a working weekend and returning on Sunday night to the White House.\nThe Vice President will be Wisconsin today for a listening session with Wisconsin business leaders and their employees, and attending with him are Secretary Price and Speaker Ryan.  Also attending with the President today in Florida Secretary DeVos, Florida Governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, who is also on the plane with us today -- as well as Secretary DeVos.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nQ    Is there any reaction from the White House to arrests in connection with the threats against Jewish community centers?\nMS. SANDERS:  Is there any what?  I'm sorry.\nQ    Reaction from the White House to the arrests.\nMS. SANDERS:  I know that happened just within the last few hours and so I will get back to you on that if there's anything specific from us.  But right now, it's still too early for us to say much about it.  Let the process work.\nQ    Can you see why the White House decided that it's okay for the Keystone XL pipeline not to be built with American steel?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, the way that the executive order is written is actually -- and I'll get you the exact language, but you can probably all have it in your inboxes if you want to look back.  But it's specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired.  And since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back.  But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that executive order.\nQ    Vice President Pence in a new story out of Indiana -- it was revealed that he used a private email server --\nMS. SANDERS:  Actually, it was --\nQ    -- or a private email account --\nMS. SANDERS:  Very different.\nQ    Sorry.  A private email account, but it was hacked.  How is that different from what Hillary Clinton did?  What's the difference?\nMS. SANDERS:  There's lightyears of difference.  Number one, he was a governor -- he wasn't a federal employee, which means the laws are different.  It's subject to Indiana law, not federal law.  Second, he's a governor, which means he wasn't handling classified information like she was.  And third, all of his emails he turned over specifically to be archived, which is why anybody even knows about the account.  He did everything to the letter of the law in Indiana, turned all of his emails over, unlike Hillary Clinton who lost at least 30,000, who knows how many more, had a private server, and had classified information, which he didn't have.  I mean, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison.\nQ    Sarah, on Russia and Sessions, is the President --\nMS. SANDERS:  I can't believe it took us that long.\nQ    I know, right?\nMS. SANDERS:  Goodness.\nQ    Is the President satisfied that recusal is enough for the Attorney General?  He seemed to say in his statement he didn't even think that that should have happened and yet the Attorney General took that step on his own.  And there are reports about other members of the President's campaign staff that had also had connections --\nMS. SANDERS:  Campaign volunteers, but yes.\nQ    -- who have been volunteers.  I mean, at what point is there a \"there\" there, as Sean said there wasn't.  I mean, at what point is -- I mean, there's so much out there.\nMS. SANDERS:  Is there really?  I mean, please explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly 80 ambassadors attended is a story.  I guess that part is kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity.  I mean, Chuck Schumer sitting, having drinks with Putin and that's not a news story, but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where there's, again, dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy, I guess.\nQ    Jeff Sessions was more than a campaign volunteer, right?\nMS. SANDERS:  As a senator, he obviously in his official capacity met with the ambassador but, again, that was a senator, not as a campaign official.  And so to try to muddy the waters in that way is I think pretty unfair to the Attorney General.\nQ    Why is the administration just now telling people about the meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower?  It seems like a little late, given that there was all this stuff about whether Flynn had had conversations with him.\nMS. SANDERS:  Look, I think this, again, was a courtesy meeting.  They were part of over a hundred different meetings during the transition.  This wasn't like a secret -- it was just -- frankly, I didn't know about it and so I don't think anybody saw it as a big deal.  There was no policy discussion.  It was an introductory, courtesy meeting, which we did literally hundreds over the course of the transition.\nQ    With other ambassadors?  How many other ambassadors?\nMS. SANDERS:  I would have to get a specific number, but I know that there were dozens of other ambassadors.\nQ    There were a number of reporters who are staked out at Trump Tower watching people go up the elevators.  No one saw the Russian ambassador.  Did he use a separate entrance?  And if so, why?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure, but I’ll check and find out, and let you guys know.\nQ    To go back to Pence and the email issue for a second, is the White House certain that he’s not using personal email as Vice President?  And has the White House sort of checked in with all the Cabinet Secretaries and people to talk to them about using personal email versus government email?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yeah, I know that we’ve all had the training on security and ethics training, and I’m also -- I will ask specifically that question, but I know that the Vice President is following the law as it’s required by him.\nQ    Can you say one thing on the education event today --  Nancy DeVos and her --\nQ    Betsy.\nQ    I’m sorry -- Betsy DeVos, sorry, and her support for school choice has obviously been controversial with teachers unions, with a lot of the Democrats.  Is this a sort of kickoff for the President in his push to try to help her adopt school choice nationwide?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think the point of today is exactly what it says -- it’s a listening session.  It’s to talk about ideas and reforms that have worked, particularly at this school, which I think you guys will get the opportunity to see that.\nLook, the number-one priority for education with the President has been consistent from day one.  It hasn’t changed, and that’s to make the power and the central focus be more on the parents and the local level, and less at the federal level.  And today is part of that process.\nQ    Is there any legislation or anything that he is going to pushing on that?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not as of today.  We’ll certainly keep you guys posted if we’re making any legislative announcements or bill signings.\nQ    There are reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting the White House later this month.  Can you confirm that today?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes, she will be there.  I believe the date is March 14th, and that is confirmed.\nQ    What will they be discussing?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not going to get ahead of their conversations, but we’ll certainly provide readouts after that meeting.  And I believe we plan to have a press conference with that, and they can address that directly.\nQ    The New York Times story about the debate over climate change and the Paris climate deal, whether the President is going to pull the U.S. out of that deal -- can you tell us where the President’s mind is on that, and if we’re expecting an announcement anytime soon?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of the President, and he hasn’t made an announcement on that, but you guys are always the first to know.\nQ    Can you talk a little bit about the RNC event tonight? What the President is going to do or say there, and anything else that he’s going to do this weekend?\nMS. SANDERS:  Sure.  I know that it’s a fundraiser.  This will be the first fundraiser he has attended as President.  And it’s -- as you would imagine -- like pretty much every other fundraiser.  The goal is to raise money for the Republican Party, and I don’t expect tonight to be any different.\nQ    Is there any access for us?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t think so, as of now.  I think the standard policy has usually been not to have press at fundraisers, but I’ll check and let you guys know.\nQ    And anything else this weekend?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know we have some other stuff.  Stephanie, who will be with you guys through the rest of the weekend, will keep you posted throughout Sunday.\nQ    Any update on the travel ban EO?\nMS. SANDERS:  We don’t have an announcement yet, but again, we’ll let you know when we’re ready to roll that out.\nQ    Any portions of his schedule for next week that you can preview today?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think we will have a week-ahead guidance later tonight, and so we’ll get that to you guys then.\nAnything else?\nQ    More on Sessions and Russia:  The President said he learned about this, as the rest of us were learning, through media reports.  Same thing with Flynn.  He didn’t know about the calls and the fact that they were discussing sanctions.  Does the President feel like he has a full understanding of what his campaign, what his staffers, what his administration has done in terms of its relationship with Russia?  Is there anything that the President feels that he doesn’t know yet?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t think so, and I think the big point here is that the President himself knows what his involvement was, and that’s zero.  And I think he’s the primary person that should be held responsible, and he had no interaction, and I think that’s what the story should be focused on.\nThanks, guys.\nQ    Thank you, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS:  You bet.\nEND\n12:54 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-03-03T00:00:00", "title": "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders En Route Orlando, Florida"}

EST\nMR. SPICER:  I hope you guys had a great visit.  I'm going to try to keep this short, obviously.  We've got a short flight time home.\nThis morning, the President was glad to see Ben Carson confirmed as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and former governor of Texas confirmed as the Secretary of Energy.  He looks forward to working with them to enact his bold agenda.  The Secretaries will be sworn in this evening -- Secretary Carson at 5:00 p.m. and then Secretary Perry at 5:30 p.m.\nThe President was honored to visit our next aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, the Gerald R. Ford, today.  As he emphasized on the campaign trail and again Tuesday in his address, expansion of the United States Armed Forces is a major priority for him, and the naval fleet is a significant portion of that.  Expanding our current fleet of ships requires a collaborative partnership between the military and industry leaders to ensure maximum efficiency for taxpayers.  The Navy is a vital part of the President's strategy to defeat terrorism with aircraft carriers, especially important in areas where we don't have a base, from which to launch missions, project power and protect American interest.\nHand-in-hand with military leaders and the shipbuilding community, the Trump administration will continue to build extraordinary crafts like the Gerald R. Ford, protect taxpayer dollars, and support the jobs the shipbuilding industry provides, and, most importantly, keep our nation safe.  While onboard today, the President received a briefing from military leaders.  He then took a tour of the ship, after which he gave remarks on the hangar bay to several thousand workers and crew members and shipyard workers, which I think you all saw.\nThe Vice President was in Ohio this afternoon with Secretary Price to discuss the President's economic agenda and especially repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster.  The Vice President then participated in a listening session with small business owners and a tour of Frame USA, an American-owned and operated small business, and delivered remarks at Frame USA.\nWith that, you have a couple questions before we --\nQ    Did Sessions lie during his testimony in January, saying he didn't have any communication with the Russians?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think the senator's comments were clearly with respect to his -- he was asked about his role as a surrogate and whether he understood the campaign -- whether the campaign had contacts, and he said no.  It was in his -- I think clearly with respect to his role as a campaign surrogate.\nQ    Has the President spoken with the Attorney General about any of this?\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    Was the President told that General Sessions should recuse himself from the Russian --\nMR. SPICER:  I think that the President -- you guys got that question answered from him directly.\nQ    Should he provide more information to the committee, perhaps, to try to clarify his comments?\nMR. SPICER:  I know the Attorney General is going to speak very shortly, so let's just -- I'll leave it at that.  But I think the President made his views clear with you guys just a short time ago.\nQ    He doesn't have any concerns about whether he should have given a more clear response at the time?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, obviously -- I mean, I'll let the Attorney General speak for himself.  But I think that clearly if you listen to what he was responding to, he's clearly referring to his role as a campaign surrogate.  That's what the question was about.  And I think there's no --\nQ    So in that role as a campaign surrogate, does that mean, like, if he was asked at a campaign rally, he's a campaign surrogate?  If he's at his office, he's a senator?  Like, where does one role begin and the other one stop?\nMR. SPICER:  We're moments away from him addressing this.  And it was really silly for me to try to talk about what he may or may not think.  But I think most people -- almost a clear -- I don't think there's very few other ways to read it when you look at the transcript and see the back and forth that he was clearly referring to himself.  He was very -- he was clear in referring to himself as a campaign surrogate and believed that that's what the question was about.  But I will let -- I mean, we're literally moments away from him addressing this, and I think the President made his view clear.\nQ    Sean, I had a big question of what he told the Senate.  Is the White House annoyed that he wasn't completely forthcoming with you guys?\nMR. SPICER:  Forthcoming about what?  I mean, he's a United States --\nQ    (Inaudible) with the Russian ambassador.\nMR. SPICER:  Wait, hold on, he's a United States senator who speaks to countless -- I mean, that's -- I mean, he was a campaign surrogate and gave the candidate at that time some ideas and advice in very important -- he had the value -- the President values his opinion tremendously, as you can tell by the fact that he wanted him in his Cabinet.\nBut the fact of the matter is, how can you do something -- I mean, he was literally conducting himself as a United States senator.\nQ    Yes, of course.\nMR. SPICER:  But hold on, and let's be clear, you look at all these other senators who have had contact, and this is what senators do in the course of conducting themselves in their job.  And as you've seen, whether it's some of these folks that initially came out of the gate and said that they had never done it, the list gets larger and larger.\nQ    But why wouldn't he go ahead and talk -- there was already this flap about the ambassador and Flynn.  Why wouldn't Sessions put it out there?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I’m going to let him answer it, but I think that it was pretty clear.  The question was about the campaign, and I think the -- literally, correct me if I’m wrong, I don’t have the question in front of me, but I think something to the effect of the campaign comments regarding the election of -- the 2016 election.  So if you haven’t had anything then there’s nothing -- I mean, again --\nQ    But (inaudible) saying he should recuse himself, and what about Nancy Pelosi and others saying he should resign?\nMR. SPICER:  I would suggest to you that I think it’s interesting that a lot of these guys -- this continues to seem to be much more of a partisan thing that we’ve seen over and over again.  As I think I’ve mentioned from the -- this continues to be a question of there’s no there there.  And it’s the same over and over and over.\nQ    You think there’s no there there.\nMR. SPICER:  It’s not that I don’t think --\nQ    (Inaudible) a Republican.\nMR. SPICER:  I know who he is.  I know it’s -- but I’m just suggesting that I think the point is that -- again, I’m going to let the Attorney General speak for himself, but the bottom line is, is that for six months now we’ve heard the same thing over and over again, unnamed sources talking about nebulous, unnamed things, and keep having to say the same thing.  At some point, you have to ask yourself where the “there” is.\nQ    Sean, we’re hearing rumblings that there may not be a new travel ban coming anymore.  Can you confirm that?  When do you expect it then?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I’ve made this very clear to you guys.  I’ll say again what I’ve said before.  I’m not -- and when the President has made a decision about something that he’s ready for us to announce, we’ll announce it, but we’re not there yet.\nBut again, I think that the --\nQ    So you’re taking your time a little bit more with it?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that we continue to have a guiding principle doing what’s right to keep the nation safe, and he’s doing everything he can to consult with agencies and departments and key stakeholders.\nQ    And he’s still committed to revising this travel ban that was blocked in court?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to tell you that there’s nothing that has changed from what I’ve said in the past.\nQ    General Sessions was talking about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer.  He said at the time that there should be --\nMR. SPICER:  What are you talking about?\nQ    When General Sessions talked about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer, he said a special prosecutor was warranted.  Why isn’t a special prosecutor necessary in this case?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I think that the question goes back to what -- he didn’t -- he was in the course of his Senate duties, did what senators do.  There’s no discussion -- there’s nothing that would lead anyone to believe that he didn’t do anything that was part of his job.\nQ    What was that meeting in regards to?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know.  But, I mean, there’s nothing -- it was in his Senate office.  There were Senate aides, from what I understand, conducting Senate business.\nQ    I don’t think anybody is -- nobody is really questioning that the senator has the right to meet with the Russian ambassador in the course of his business.  My question before was rather whether after -- when he’s become attorney general, he didn’t take the President or someone in the White House aside and say, listen, I don’t think -- there was nothing untoward here but this is pertinent information given the current political climate.\nMR. SPICER:  What pertinent information?\nQ    That he met with the Russian ambassador and it wasn’t disclosed to the Senate.\nMR. SPICER:  But he probably met with countless other ambassadors.  And I think -- again, he probably met with countless other associations and constituents and --\nQ    So that’s not something you would have wanted to know?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t -- I guess my question is, why would we want to know everything that he did in conducting himself on behalf of the people of Alabama?\nQ    Okay, so you’re fine with it coming out in the papers and learning about it this way?\nMR. SPICER:  Learning about -- but here’s my question:  Learning about what?  The fact of the matter is, if we’re learning about the fact that he did his job as a United States senator, then that’s great.  I don’t think there has been anything that I’m aware of at this time that suggests anything other than he did his job as a United States senator as, frankly, many of these other senators have now said, well, I met with this ambassador, or another ambassador.  I mean, that’s what senators do.\nQ    What about the Counsel’s Office asking staff to preserve Russia-related documents, materials --\nMR. SPICER:  That's a pro-forma, standard operating procedure that -- and I think, frankly, it shows how serious we take this subject.\nQ    The President hasn’t spoken to Sessions either last night or today?  Why not?\nMR. SPICER:  Why not?  I mean, I think -- I’m not --\nQ    Even though there’s no there there --\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, again, I think --\nQ    Have you spoken to Sessions, Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not going to -- look, I’m just going to say that the Attorney General is going to make a statement very shortly, and I’ll let that stand for itself.\nWe’re going to go down.  Thank you, guys.\nQ    Sean, do you have anything on al-Masri?\nMR. SPICER:  On what?\nQ    Al-Masri's death?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I -- when we land I can maybe get something.  Thanks, guys.\nEND\n3:54 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:40 A.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Hi, guys.  I'm going to try to keep this relatively short.  We got a few things going on today, and I know that the pool has got to get out to do a spray at some point soon with the lunch.\nSo, obviously, last night was a big night for the President and for everyone here at the White House.  The President delivered a powerful statement to Congress, to Americans, and the world last night.  It was an optimistic, forward-looking message of unity, strength, straight from his heart.  The President was proud to stand before the American people last night and present his roadmap for a renewal of the American spirit.  He honestly and -- he honestly acknowledged the undeniable challenges that we face, but continually reminded us there's no challenge facing this country that we can't meet if we join together.\nThe American spirit has already proven itself against seemingly insurmountable odds, and we'll do it again under the leadership of this President.\nRepublicans and Democrats may be divided on policies, but we're also united in our mission to achieve peace and prosperity for every American citizen.  The President has obviously been humbled by the great reception that the -- the reception that his address received.  Today, the President is holding a series of meetings with White House staff, congressional leaders, and others to drive the goals that he laid out last night.\nHe'll host shortly a leadership lunch with House and Senate Republican leadership.  The attendees will include the Vice President, Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Senator Cornyn, Leader McCarthy, Congressman Scalise, Senator Gardiner and Senator Perdue.\nLast night's address clearly generated a lot of momentum, and the President is anxious to continue working on an ambitious legislative agenda.  During his speech last night, the President mentioned policies in key areas, from urban renewal to trade reform, where too many leading agencies and departments in charge of implementing are still waiting on their confirmed leaders.\nThe President was pleased, obviously, to see that Ryan Zinke was confirmed as the Secretary of the Interior by the Senate just a short time ago.  So the confirmation process is now coming to an end for him, and start to get the work going.\nAs the President mentioned in last night's remarks -- and, by the way, one quick note, we'll have an update on his swearing-in hopefully soon.  As the President mentioned in last night's remarks, he's calling on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a patient-focused system that expands options, lowers costs, and improves healthcare outcomes for all Americans.  He's ready to restart the honest engine -- to restart the engine of the American economy, which means tax reform that brings down rates for the middle class and simplifies the tax code, a robust infrastructure program and a budget that puts the interests of American people first.\nThe President and congressional leaders will work together today to continue to chart a path forward on those issues and more.  Also, today, Judge Neil Gorsuch will be back up on the Hill meeting with seven senators, including Senators Booker, Sanders, Barrasso and Kaine.  And lastly, this evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary Tillerson.\nLooking ahead, I know Sarah was kind enough to come brief you yesterday about the President's trip to Hampton Roads tomorrow.  I'll have a few more details for you on that.  The President is looking forward to meeting with the members of the Navy and some of the sailors down there, the shipbuilders, including the lead shipbuilder of the USS Gerald Ford and the ship's commander, before giving remarks on deck to a group of shipbuilders and sailors.\nOn Friday, the President will be in Orlando, Florida for a series of important events highlighting his educational agenda.  He'll be visiting St. Andrews Catholic School, where I think you can expect him to drop in on a few lucky classrooms, as well as meeting with parents, teachers, and administrators.  Education, as was noted last night from the President, is a top priority.  He has said many times before that education has the ability to level the playing field for the next generation.  Obviously, last night he noted that he believes this is the civil rights issue of this generation.  He is determined to provide choice for every parent, and opportunities for every child, regardless of their zip code.  I expect he will be speaking with the parents and teachers and administrators at St. Andrews on his upcoming plans for reaching that goal.\nAnd finally, I want to note that the President is monitoring the situation in the Midwest, where a string of tornadoes is devastating several states with more severe weather predicted for the coming states -- for the coming days.  Three lives have already been tragically cut short.  The families of those victims and also those who have had their homes and property destroyed are in the President's thoughts and prayers.  The millions of people in the path of severe weather will be at the top of his mind over the next few days.  He implores everyone to follow the directions of emergency services and stay inside, and obviously will continue to be in contact with state and local officials to provide the necessary federal support that is required.\nWith that, I'm glad to take some questions.\nQ    On the lunch today, was it always --\nMR. SPICER:  John Roberts.  (Laughter.)\nQ    -- was it always just going to be Republican leadership?  Were the Democrats ever invited?  Will he meet with the Democrats?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I'm sure he will.  And you've seen he's met with a bipartisan group of Senate leaders last week.  He met with a bipartisan group of attorney general yesterday.  He met with the bipartisan group of governors.  I mean, just to be factual here, at some point, the people who set the agenda and the timetable to enact his agenda are Republican, and so there's a difference between meeting with both sides of the aisle, and I think he has pretty well shown a desire to reach across the aisle in the last month.  But this is about actually charting out the agenda and the timeline, and that’s why it’s both groups.  But yeah, I think you'll continue to see not just -- in the next week, not just leadership but rank-and-file members of the House and the Senate with that aim.\nQ    Sean, the Dow Jones crossed 21,000 for the first time today.\nMR. SPICER:  It did.\nQ    Does the White House believe that that’s a reaction to the President’s speech last night?\nMR. SPICER:  (Laughter.)  Look, I’m not an economist.  I don’t want to -- I know the Dow goes up and down, as well as the other indexes, and I don’t want to get in the habit of commenting every time the Dow hits.  But I think that you’ve seen a sustained economic boon since the President was elected.  He commented on it last night.\nI think you’re seeing not just the Dow react, but manufacturers, business leaders, folks from small and large companies talk about it.  And I think that there is a renewed sense of wanting to business, and of economic growth and optimism.  You’ve seen it in not just in the indexes on a day-to-day basis as they go up and down, but also in the confidence numbers that show that there is a continued growth in the confidence in our economy and our market and our policies.\nLook, I don’t want to tie a direct link.  I think that that’s -- you know, we could go back and forth every day about where the market stands at any given time in a day.  But I would have to believe that when you talk to a lot of economists, they -- and frankly, not just the economists who look at it academically and try to parse it, but when you talk to these company CEOs and leaders that he’s talking to, there is a renewed sense of confidence in their country, in the agenda, in the desire to hire and grow and expand in the United States, and I can only see that as a positive sign, not just for the market, but for our entire economy.\nQ    How long -- to follow up on that -- how long does the President think he can wait in order to provide specifics on tax reform and Obamacare and the others before we start to lose that sense of momentum and confidence that you’re talking about in the markets?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think it’s not just those pieces.  Obviously, it’s bigger than just that.  But I think that, with respect to Obamacare, he's talked about the next few weeks having something out there, and then same with tax reform.  And I think both of those things that we'll be working with the Hill.  Secretary Mnuchin mentioned the other day that hopefully having a tax plan done by (inaudible).\nBut both of those, specifically, are massive undertakings.  And the idea that they are going to be done in two seconds is a little bit of a fallacy, and I think that we’ve given folks updates and guidelines as far as when we see this thing moving.  And I think that that’s a pretty good guide of where we go.\nJim Stinson.\nQ    Sean, Governor Beshear said on Morning Joe today -- I’m paraphrasing -- that people are going to die if GOP healthcare plans more forward.  What does the administration say to Democrats suggesting Obamacare repeal will cost American lives?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I would suggest to the former governor that, when you look at where Obamacare stands right now -- I think I’ve mentioned this before, Jim -- but more and more people are facing higher and higher premiums.  People are choosing to opt out of the exchange and pay the penalty.  It is collapsing on its own.\nAnd I don’t -- I think that that’s a bit extreme.  The reality is that more people are having problems right now.  They’re losing their doctor.  They’re losing the plan that they liked.  I’d like him to defend -- I mean, I read to you guys two days ago Nancy Pelosi’s own definition of success for Obamacare.  They had three prongs for that, and they failed on all three of them.\nSo Governor Beshear -- you know, the President last night extended an olive branch to Democrats and Republicans to work with him on a plan that actually achieves the goals that were laid out.  That’s what he should -- if he wants to be focused, it’s not just former governors, but I think current governors were here to talk about what they want.  And so I know Governor Bevin, the current governor of Kentucky, has noted the concerns that Obamacare has in Kentucky now.  And I think those are the challenges and problems that the President is seeking to fix on this.\nThe reality is, is that we have to have a healthcare system that Americans can afford, that give them choice, that have doctors that can deal with the problems they have.  And that's what we're working with Congress on right now is to get that kind of a plan in place.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  One brief question.\nMR. SPICER:  Wow.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Senator Schumer, the Minority Leader, has said that the President is stalling on one of the pivotal points of his agenda -- infrastructure -- where he could work with Democrats.  What's the administration's response to Senator Schumer?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think first and foremost, I'm glad to see that he has finally found one area that he's willing to work with the President on.  I know that multiple times this morning he was offered an opportunity on various shows to talk about things that he thought they could work with on the -- with the President.  And I think it took -- in particular, I saw the exchange on NBC and it was somewhat disappointing that when you look at all the things that the President said that I think offered an olive branch to both parties and seemingly should unify the country on issues and on goals, that it's nice to finally hear that we found one.  Because I think there were a lot of areas in that speech last night that transcended party lines and ideology, and that united us all as Americans.\nWith respect to infrastructure, I think the President noted last night that we're going to continue to see a plan evolve that's really structured in a private partner financing mechanism that will continue to move forward.  But whether it's our roads or bridges, our airports, air traffic control, there is an infrastructure piece of our nation that is so vital to the way we do life.  And not just that, but -- not just the building itself and the construction of it, but those roads are what -- are the byway and the pathway to so much of our economic commerce today.  And doing them not only is good for the jobs that they will create on the projects, but allowing us to have -- allowing products to get to market and consumers to get to business, et cetera, is actually a magnifying event for that.\nQ    Sean, I'm just looking for some clarification on your comments from the last week about the administration's stance on recreational marijuana.  During the campaign, the President had said that this is a states' rights issue.  Is this still where he believes this issue should flow, or does he believe it's a federal --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think, Trey, there is a specific carve-out in the appropriations for medical marijuana.  And I think the President understands that that can be a vital part of treatment, especially for terminally ill patients and people facing certain kinds of medical things.  But there is a -- I think I was very -- I'm sorry if I wasn't, but I think I was clear that there is a big difference between the medical and the non-medical.\nMargaret.\nQ    Sean, two things on the speech.  The President talked about robust engagement when he was talking about foreign policy.  But at the same time, the White House is talking about cutting foreign aid by a large amount.  How do you track those two things?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, because you can have engagement -- I mean, I don't know that --\nQ    Like, who is going to be doing the diplomacy if you're cutting the State Department funding?\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, who is going to be doing it?  There's people that do --\nQ    Who is the lead on foreign policy?  Is it the White House or the State Department?\nMR. SPICER:  Secretary of State.\nQ    It is the Secretary of State?\nMR. SPICER:  Of course, it is.  I mean, look, the President obviously guides our foreign policy in terms of who implements it, whether it's -- if you talk about healthcare, it's going to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  If it's on trade, it's going to be the USTR.  I mean, so it's pretty clear that the Secretary of State implements the President's foreign policy agenda.\nQ    Right, but more robust versus cutting.  They sound contradictory --\nMR. SPICER:  But, again, I think this is a very Washington trap.  Just because dollars do not decide engagement -- I think one of the things that's fascinating is that as the President has talked to all of these foreign leaders -- I don't know in a single case -- and, again, I can't say I've been on every call -- but I can't think of -- maybe one or two or something, because again, I don't want to get in a trap of trying to -- but I cannot say in most cases, at least, that I've heard direct aid being a discussion that has come up.\nIn fact, what I hear more often is:  \"Gosh, we haven’t heard from the United States in a long time.  We haven’t had you engage in issues of concern with us.  We haven’t talked about trade.  We haven’t talked about other issues of bilateral concern.\"  I think that's what a robust, healthy, bilateral relationship with a country is about.\nI think it is a very Washington-centered argument to literally tie dollars to any program or any type of engagement -- to say something is robust by the dollar figure is something that is a very Washington answer.  But I think that you can look at dollars that have gotten to a lot of countries.  And when we ask them, what's your relationship been with the United States?  They’ll say, we haven’t had much engagement at all with the United States in a while.\nAnita.\nQ    Sorry, I had a second question --\nMR. SPICER:  John tried to start something; it just didn't continue.  (Laughter.)\nQ    In the speech last night, while the President talked about support for vets and support for military, he didn't talk about the 9,000 troops in Afghanistan, the 5,000 in Iraq, the hundreds of operators on the ground in Syria.  Was there a reason that he didn't lay out his vision for foreign policy in those active war zones?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think you could probably go through and say, he also didn't talk about this or that.  He talked about his --\nQ    The world is watching, and those are clear --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  But you can go through a lot of hotspots that we have in a country.  I think when it comes to the military itself, he was very clear about his commitment to the military, his desire to fund the military, give them the infrastructure that it needs.  It’s why he’s going to go to Hampton Roads tomorrow to talk about the investment that needs to get made.  He talked about veterans and caring for the folks.\nSo I understand your question.  But I think at some point you can literally go through all of the other areas that may not have come up on domestic and foreign policy, other nations that didn't get a mention, or a hotspot that didn't get up.\nBut I think in terms of his commitment to the country, his commitment to defeating ISIS, he did bring that up.  He talked about the plan that he wants to have, the engagement that he’s having with the Joint Chiefs in the military, the funding that he wants to lend them.\nSo I get that you can parse out something and say, \"but he didn't bring up this exact thing.\"  There’s a lot of things that may or may not have come up last night, and that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't have the commitment to it.\nQ    He wasn’t deemphasizing foreign policy?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think he talked about ISIS.  He talked about the military.  He talked about it.  So I don't have --\nAnita.\nQ    It will not surprise you that I have two questions.  The first one is quick.\nMR. SPICER:  I think for Lent everyone needs to give up two questions.  (Laughter.)  Or maybe I could at least give up answering two questions.  (Laughter.)\nQ    I’ll make the first one quick, so how about that?  Can you update us on where we are on the executive order regarding vetting?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, as I said, we would have an announcement at some point scheduling-wise.  When we have one, we’ll announce it.  I think the President, as I mentioned a couple days ago, the issue for us has been a continued desire to share with the departments and agencies the ability to implement this, and we continue to do that.  When we have a schedule to announce --\nQ    When do you think --\nMR. SPICER:  I’ve not -- I’ve learned not to put days on things, because until we announce it, it’s much like we've talked about all the executive orders, with all the personnel announcements.  When the President is ready to make a decision, he lets us know and we let you know.  So we're not there yet.\nQ    The second question -- can you tell us a little bit about the back story with Carryn Owens being there yesterday?  She wasn’t on the list you all sent out.  When did the President talk to her?  When did that happen?  When was she invited?  Why wasn’t she on the official list?  And did they have a chance to visit beforehand?\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, I'll take these in order.  She was invited on January 30th.  In the condolence call to her, the President invited her and her three children to the White House.  And during that call, said, \"You know, by the way, I'm going to be giving this speech in February.  If you would feel comfortable, I would love to have you as a guest.\"  He asked if she'd like to bring the kids at that time.  It was obviously a very raw and emotional time for her, and she said that's -- she appreciated the invitation, she would love to take him up on it, would get back to us.  The President asked the military aide in the room at the time to follow up with her.  She accepted the invitation.  So she and her three children came to the White House yesterday, met with the President prior to the speech, and they had a time to visit before and then after, obviously.\nWhy she wasn’t on the guidance:  We had a conversation with her prior, and just said, you know, I know this is an emotional time for you.  Respectfully to you guys, we knew that if we had released her name, that there would be a lot of media attention to her and her family.  And we spoke to her before we put out the guest guidance and just said, would you rather us wait and hold?  So we made a decision at the time that this was a very raw and emotional time for her, and we didn’t -- we worked with her to decide what would be in her best interest and her family's best interest at this time.\nQ    Were the children there?\nMR. SPICER:  No, they were not there.\nQ    But her parents were there, correct?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    But the children were in town --\nMR. SPICER:  The children were in town.  They visited the White House.  They had an opportunity to visit the Navy Mess, have lunch, go up and see -- and so the President got to see them.  And they got a tour of the White House.\nQ    Was there some special interaction with Ivanka, because she was sitting next to her?  Or it just happened to be where she sat?\nMR. SPICER:  They met obviously over -- and obviously after -- at the end of the evening, the President brought them into the room where he was holding, and everybody, including the First Lady, had a chance to talk to her and her family, and mother and father.  But, as I said, this was something that was extended -- the invitation was extended to her on the 30th of January when the President made that first call to her.\nAnd again, just respectfully in terms of the follow-up, I know there's been a lot of interest in her, in Carryn.  And we have -- our goal was to make sure that we respected her wishes and her privacy.  And again, even with referencing her in the speech, that was her decision.  We asked her -- the President would like to raise this.  And she said, I'd like that.  And so that was coordinated with her in terms of how public she wanted to be and how acknowledged she wanted her and Ryan to be as well.\nQ    I just thought I'd bring this up so you could respond to it.  You must have seen the criticism of her being there and the President mentioning her.  And people are saying it's a photo-op.  So since you're talking about it, do you want to respond to that, that it's a way to --\nMR. SPICER:  I think that that's -- I mean, again, he invited her on January 30th and extended an invitation.  I don’t -- it was she who accepted the invitation.  I think she has a right to honor the legacy and sacrifice of her husband.  And I think -- I've been in this town 25 years, probably watched State of the Unions for 30 -- which doesn’t say a lot -- (laughter) -- for my viewing habits -- but I've never seen a sustained applause like that.  And I think that you can say what you want about a lot of the policies, but I hope to God that everybody in America could literally say that that's the country that we live in, that you honor and support, not just Ryan's sacrifice, but her -- what she's going to go through and what those children are going to go through.\nIt was amazing -- I got a chance to talk to the kids yesterday and see them so -- you know, they're kids, they were happy, they were running around.  I don’t know that they fully appreciate the sacrifice that their father has made.  But I just -- I'm not going to -- if that's the criticism that people that, they have a right to in this country.  But I would also suggest that we have the right to honor the people who have served this nation and the sacrifice that the families make of those who serve.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  There were some quotes floating around last night from anonymous administration officials saying --\nMR. SPICER:  What?  (Laughter.)\nQ    What a surprise, right?  (Laughter.)  That part of the reason for the postponement of the announcement of the new travel ban was the positive reception of the speech, and that the administration wants the new executive order to \"have its own moment.\"  Was the speech perception part of the reason --\nMR. SPICER:  I will just refer you back to what I said to Anita's first question.  We hadn’t made an announcement.  And I think that -- again, this gets back to personnel announcements, executive order announcements, other things.  Until they're on the schedule, that doesn’t make them official.  And that's the point of making the announcement, is that we say this is where we're going and this is what we're doing.  We try to provide you guys guidance.  Obviously, there's a reason that we don’t -- because sometimes things aren’t ready, sometimes we want to make -- the President hasn’t made up his final mind about executing something, or he wants to add something in.  It's the same thing with the speech yesterday.  I mean, we worked up until game time because the President wanted to continue to work on it.\nBut when we have announcements to make, we'll make them.  Until we do, then it's not final.\nMara.\nQ    Thank you.  I have two really short questions.  The first one on the travel ban.  The first request was for 90 days so that you could develop the new vetting regime.  Thirty days have passed.  I assume that means you're 30 days into this process.  Does that mean that the next travel ban will ask for just the remaining time of the 90 days?\nMR. SPICER:  Respectfully, I'm not -- this goes back to the last couple.  I'm not going to start getting into discussions of an executive order that hasn’t been announced yet.  So to start talking about the specifics of something that I'm not even going to talk about the schedule of -- I'll give you credit for the try.\nQ    Okay, that's fair.  My next question is on taxes.  He talked about massive tax cuts for the middle class.  Your Treasury Secretary at one point said there would be no absolute cut for the wealthy.  What does that mean?\nMR. SPICER:  It means that I think the focus is on the middle class.  I think there's two things that are going to be highlighted in the tax reform.  One is to make our companies and corporations and businesses more competitive so that they stay in this country and hire more people.  I mean, that's --\nQ    Right, I'm talking individuals.\nMR. SPICER:  I know, I know.  But what I'm saying is that there's two big components are going to drive tax reform -- that being one to help companies hire more people.  And then two is the focus on the individual side of the ledger is going to be on middle-income tax relief.  And so I think that's what Secretary Mnuchin was referring to.\nQ    But are you saying that a wealthy person will not get a larger -- in terms of percentage -- tax cut than a middle-class person?  I mean, is that how you're measuring it?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, all I'm going to do is stick at the high level now and say that the principle that's guiding this is middle-class tax relief.  So I'm not going to get into deciding all this yet.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  A lot has been made about the President's tone, his demeanor last night in his address to Congress in the sense that some people are describing it as very presidential; we haven't seen this side of President Trump in the early days of his presidency.  Was this a one-off?  Is this something we can expect from the President more often?  For instance, tomorrow he is traveling down to the Newport News, Virginia area.  Will we see the President Trump that we saw last night in his address to Congress, or more like the campaign-style rally that we saw down in Florida, which took place a few weeks ago?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the Vice President said it best this morning.  I mean, this is the President Trump, the candidate Trump, the President-elect Trump that I've known.  And I think sometimes -- so I respectfully disagree in the sense that I think that the folks around him who have known him, who have gotten to know him, this is something that you see on a regular basis.  And I think we're going to continue to see this.\nI think more and more -- one of the programs this morning noted that people who have been around him for a long time, this is who he is.  I think he's talked about this a lot, and I know sometimes you pull random clips, but this is who he is.  And I don't necessarily subscribe to are we going to see more or less of this.  He cares about this country, he's got a big heart, he wants America to succeed, he wants America to be safe, he wants more Americans to get back to work.  And I think you're going to hear him talk about that over and over again.\nBlake.\nQ    Sean, the trade document that's out there, which suggests that the administration may take a position that would potentially ignore or look past WTO rulings.  Is there any truth to this?\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    What is the position?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I would just argue, look, we're a member of the WTO, we don't have a USTR in place yet.  So to suggest that we're going to take any kind of trade policies -- I think, obviously, we've got some concerns with the percentage of dispute resolutions that are brought to the WTO versus other nations.  But I would just -- that's sort of a fact in terms of the percentage of cases that get brought to dispute resolution at the USTR -- or, excuse me, at the WTO against the United States.  But we don't have a U.S. Trade Representative, so I would say that that's not --\nQ    Like a working --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no.  I mean, it's not even a working. That's not -- full stop -- that is not our policy and that's not where we're going.\nYes.\nQ    Sean, this is a follow-up on the -- from the heart.  Was the President's softening of his immigration stand one from the heart or one from the political handbook?  Let's put it that way.  And did you get ashes this morning?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, as soon as -- I mean, not that I’m a big fan of sharing, but I will be going to get my ashes later in a little bit.  So --\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER:  I appreciate that.  I will (inaudible) in mass, and I’ll let my mom know that you appreciate that, and my parish priest.  (Laughter.)\nQ    -- might be able to see you --\nMR. SPICER:  I try to keep a little bit of the church and state out of this.\nQ    Do you have a confession?\nMR. SPICER:  Huh?\nQ    Do you a have a confession while you're up there?  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  There’s three parts to Lent:  alms giving, penance, and prayer.  And I will make sure that I spend all 40 --\nQ    Can you answer the first part of the question?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I’m good with -- I’m sorry I got lost in my faith.  (Laughter.)\nQ    The President’s softening --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, thank you.  Look, I don’t know that I would agree.  Look, the President’s comments yesterday that were that, if we can get a bill, he would like to get that done.  I think he -- in the conversation that he was having with network anchors, he talked about the fact -- and, frankly, one of the anchors said, if anyone can get a deal, it would be you.  Obviously, he was pleased with that because it’s true.  And I think he recognizes that a solution, a comprehensive solution has eluded our nation for a long time, and it’s a big problem.  And if he can get it, consistent with his principles, he will.  And I think he made that clear, and the full context of those comments are just that, and in the speech he commented on as well.\nAnd I think there’s a difference between sacrificing your principles to get a deal, and working with others, consistent with your principles to get a deal.  And I think his principles remain consistent, and he understands that the benefit of actually enacting a comprehensive solution to a big problem that we face in the country, I think that’s kind of where his head is at.\nZeke.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  I’m sorry.  Go ahead, Zeke.\nQ    Okay.  Two for you.  First, following up on Monday, the ISIS review -- the status of the review process -- who was involved and what is being (inaudible)?  The President -- who else is being looped into the process?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m sorry, I owed you that, and I will get back to you.  The principals committee did meet.  General Mattis shared his outline and ideas and comments, and he got a lot of feedback from the principals committee.  And remember, that’s -- and I’d need to get Michael to get back with you on that.  I owe you that, and my apologies.  I’ll add it to my confession.  (Laughter.)\nQ    And then the second is, just following the President's line of speech last night about “the time for trivial fights is behind us” -- does the President believe that he has also sometimes engaged in some of these trivial fights?  And going forward, should we be expecting less of these fights from him with all sorts of people?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to let -- the President’s vision and words last night should stand for themselves.  I think he was very clear in terms of what he expects from the country.\nJessica.\nQ    The President talked about merit-based immigration last night.  Can you talk a little bit more about what that means, and whether that indicates a desire to change legal immigration from a focus on family reunification to some sort of making sure they have a job in the United States?  And was he also trying to imply that we don’t have a merit-based immigration system?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think he was -- look, I would just refer you back to what he said.  I mean, you’ve got countries like Canada and Australia, in particular, that have a true merit-based system, and I think he was making it clear that we currently don’t necessarily -- the results of our immigration system don’t yield, necessarily, one that reflects a merit-based one.\nBut I will say that there was, I think, a very substantial case that he made in terms of merit-based -- what he wants and how he wants to get there.\nJeremy.\nQ    Can I have a second?  I was going to have a second question.\nMR. SPICER:  I’m sorry.\nQ    The President also had a comment about how many factories have left the United States since China joined the WTO.  Last night his number was 60,000.  A week ago, on February 23rd, he used the figure of 70,000.  Just wondering what the genesis of the figure is, and what the White House believes to be the number of factories.  And also whether it is truly attributable to China joining the WTO or other factors, as well.\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to -- we’ll get somebody to follow up with you on the cite for that, as well.\nI went to Jeremy.\nQ    Is the President considering the Pentagon and his Defense Secretary more authority to greenlight raids like the kind that we saw in Yemen?  And is that, in part, driven by the political blowback that that raid had initially?\nAnd secondly, could you talk about -- the initial executive order on the travel ban called for a 30-day review period to see if they would -- you would add additional countries to the list of banned --\nMR. SPICER:  I’ll take the second one first.  I can refer you back to Mara Liasson’s question.  (Laughter.)\nOn the first part, I think that he has been very clear from the get-go.  He talked about some of the tactics used a while ago, and he said, I’m going to rely on General Mattis and his expertise.  And I think when it comes to national security, he’s got an amazing team by all standards -- whether it’s Secretary Mattis, Secretary Kelly, General McMaster.  There’s a whole host of these -- with General Kellogg.  And I think he’s always talked about he’s going to rely on his advisors to give him advice.\nI think at the end of the day there are certain decisions that have to be signed off by the President.  And I would respectfully dispute the characterization of that, and I think we've pushed back and discussed this several times.  There is -- this raid and action and mission was one that I think we have detailed very, very closely -- or carefully -- about the timeline for this, and when it was signed off on, and by whom.  And it was initiated, signed off on by the previous administration in writing, with a signature to greenlight it.  And it was further reviewed and concurred under this administration that the same basis for greenlighting it back then stood.\nSo, respectfully, the actual timeline and documentation does not support the accusation or the question that you're trying to ask.\nQ    And just as far as this was -- is nothing going to change as far as who greenlights certain raids?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think legally -- Jeremy, I don't want to get into specifics because I think there is certain action that requires presidential sign-off.  And there’s certain action in terms of echelon -- the way the military works, you have different echelons that can be signed off on certain things.  And I think there are certain things that have to be signed off by the President of the United States.\nQ    (Inaudible) protocol.\nMR. SPICER:  So the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off, but I think that the President has made clear -- all that being said, he relies heavily on their input, their decision-making, their opinions, and their analysis and conclusions.  That's different.  And I think one of the issues that you saw -- or some of the criticism that you saw last administration was that you had a lot of the combatant commanders in particular who would say, we came to a conclusion, we made the case, and we weren't allowed to move forward.\nThat's where I think the nuance that you're asking actually lies, which is --\nQ    Right, so is he making a change to address that criticism?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no.  I think his point -- it's a philosophy more than a sort of a change in policy, which is he believes that these are the experts in this field -- as he does with all of his Cabinet.  I mean, I think if you ask -- in terms of foreign policy interaction, he would say, okay, I chose Secretary Tillerson because I believe he's the right guy for this job; if Betsy DeVos has an educational matter that's going to come up.  He chose these highly qualified individuals because he believes in their expertise and understanding of the issues.\nI think his point and his philosophy is, generally, if they come to him with a case and lay it out, then he is -- that is going to weigh heavily on his decision-making, whereas I think in the last administration, one of the major critiques was that they would come to them and then there was a preponderance -- the preponderance of time.  It would be, no, we're not going to move forward with this.  So I just want to be --\nPhil.\nQ    Sean, a lot of lawmakers were heartened by the speech last night and drew a contrast from the inaugural address 40 days prior, and said that the tone was very different, the substance was different, the olive branches and outreach.  Does the White House agree with that characterization?  Was it on purpose?  And if it was on purpose, what, over the course of those 40 days, inspired the course correction?\nMR. SPICER:  It was not on purpose.  There is no -- I mean, one was an inaugural.  One was a joint address.  They're two different speeches, and I think that they serve two different purposes in terms of what you're trying to lay out.  I think the joint address serves as sort of a place hold for the State of the Union for first term -- or first year, first term.\nQ    The way he communicated.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand -- you're right.  And I think he wanted to lay out -- it's a much different and longer speech.  He had different sort of messaging objectives at each.  But I also dispute the notion on the inaugural.  Like, I mean, I think that when you actually look at the critique, people will look at four or five different lines.  But for the most part, for much -- the most part -- the high majority of that speech, he talked about the American people, the American worker, and the challenges that they face and where he thinks the country has kind of gotten off-track prioritizing them and his desire to put, what he called, the forgotten people back number one in line.\nAnd then so one was sort of -- that was laying out his sort of vision for the presidency.  This time I think it was much more of a laying out the policies of how he's going to achieve that.  And that's the purpose of a joint address.  So I just -- it's two different speeches, but I just don't agree with the characterization of the inaugural in the first place.\nQ    Was there some conclusion, though, in the White House or by the President himself that that rhetorical approach early on in the presidency, that the tweets, that the speeches -- like he did at CPAC the other day, the fighting with the media -- that that was not helping and he needed to do something different?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  No, no, there wasn't.  I just -- again, I think he -- and this particular speech was a very personal -- again, like, each speech, each speech has a different audience, a different objective.  And I think for this speech, he was very personal, he was very, very much him.  It was his work, it was his voice, it was his words, it was his edits, it was his suggestions.\nAnd then he had a team surrounded by him, including the Vice President, the chief of staff, Steve Miller, Steve Bannon, Jared, Ivanka was part of it.  There was a -- Kellyanne, Hope -- who he would bounce ideas and objectives off of.  But this was a Trump speech from his heart, as he said, that evolved over the course of the last 10 days or so.  And in the last 48 to 72 hours, really accelerated, got very crisp.  And it was up until about 12:15 -- excuse me, that's when I got home.  (Laughter.)  About 6:15 yesterday when we really started to get that real final point on it, because it was something that was very, very personal to him.  But I wouldn't conflate the two and try to compare one speech with another.  He looked at them as very different objectives in terms of how the speech.\nI need to run.\nQ    But, Sean, was this a reset?  Was it a reset speech?\nMR. SPICER:  No, it wasn't a reset speech.  I need to get on.  I've got some things I have to take care of.  But thank you.  We will, as I mentioned, expect a gaggle on the way down to Hampton Roads tomorrow, and we will see you later.\nThank you all.\nEND\n12:25 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n3:07 P.M. EST\nMS. SANDERS:  Good Afternoon.  Sorry for the delay.  Obviously, I never want to step on anything the President is doing, so I wanted to wait until he finished.  The President has obviously got a full day and night planned, so I’m going to try to keep this short so that you guys can get focused on his speech coming up later.\nFirst off, and I know Sean briefly spoke about this yesterday -- and, by the way, just for clarification, he is not here, clearly, because he is up on the Hill briefing House and Senate communicators about the speech and previewing that for them right now.  But Sean mentioned this yesterday, and I’m sure that it stuck with me, but the story has developed further.  I wanted to address the tragic shooting in Kansas.  The President is keeping the family of the victim, who was senselessly, killed in his thoughts, and we’re praying for the full and speedy recovery of those who were wounded.\nAs more facts come to light, and it begins to look like this was an act of racially-motivated hatred, we want to reiterate that the President condemns these and any other racially- or religiously-motivated attacks in the strongest terms.  They have no place in our country, and we will continue to make that clear.\nIn regards to the rest of the events today, this morning the Vice President swore in Secretary Ross as the Secretary of Commerce in his ceremonial office, and the President knows Secretary Ross is eager to get started building the country back up again, and we’re glad to finally have him in place at the Commerce Department to do just that.\nMoving on to the President’s day, this morning, after receiving his national daily intelligence briefing, the President met with the National Association of Attorneys General, and then had lunch with members of the press, as is tradition for the day of the joint address to Congress.\nThis afternoon, the President, as most of you saw, just signed two bills and executive orders.  The first bill, H.R. 321, also known as the INSPIRE Act, encourages NASA to have women and girls participate in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and to pursue careers in aerospace using extreme programs and resources.\nH.R. 255, or the Promoting Women and Entrepreneurship Act, is a similar bill targeted to the National Science Foundation.  The bill encourages NSF to also use existing programs to recruit and support the employment of women in the sciences.  These bills are the next step in the President’s continued focus on empowering women of all ages and all interests to pursue their chosen careers.\nAs you saw, the President and Prime Minister Trudeau spent an afternoon speaking with female business leaders about the unique challenges facing women in the workplace earlier this month.  And just last week, during his listening session with manufacturing CEOs, the President heard from a breakout group focused specifically on policies that could help lessen or remove some of those same barriers.\nThe President also signed two executive orders.  The first instructs the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review and reconsider the Obama administration’s Clean Water Rule, as well as providing instruction to the Attorney General for current legal action on the rule.  The Obama administration’s rule vastly expands federal jurisdiction into state and local areas, and the decisions that directly affects them, and that’s something that this administration does not take lightly.\nThe second executive order will make Historically Black Colleges and Universities a priority again in the White House.  This order provides a framework for repositioning the HBCU initiative in the White House, allowing it to function across all executive departments and agencies in consultation with the Department of Education.\nAs you might have seen yesterday, the President welcomed the over 60 presidents of HBCUs and representatives from leading HBCU organizations to the Oval Office before their listening session with the Vice President and Secretary DeVos.  The President is extremely committed to keeping the promises he made regarding HBCUs on the campaign trail, and looks forward to working with these leaders and organizations to provide HBCUs with the resources that they need.\nLater this afternoon, probably right about now, the President is meeting with the guests who will be seated with the First Lady at his first address to the Joint Congress.  We provided a list and shorts bios of each of the guests via email last night.  Now, I’m also able to confirm two additional guests for the First Lady: Jessica Gregory and her proud mother, Sheila Gregory.  Jessica was diagnosed at birth with spina bifida, and has undergone 11 surgeries at Children’s National Health System.  Today, she is a dynamic 18-year-old honor student in Maryland, planning for college and a career as a public interest reporter, which was sparked by her experiences at Children’s National Seacrest Studios.\nLater this evening, the President will proceed to the U.S. Capitol where he will address the Joint Session of Congress at 9:10 p.m.  And, of course, I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s safe to say that the President will be presenting a forward-looking vision to the American people.  He’s already proven that he can bring results and relief to this country, and a wave of optimism is surging across the country in response.\nIn terms of an outline of some of the policy areas the President will address during his speech, the President will specifically ask Congress to join him in coming up with and implementing solutions to restart the engine of our economy, provide more access to quality, affordable healthcare, expand educational opportunities to every child no matter their zip code, and unite with law enforcement and the military to protect our communities and our homeland.\nTogether, with the help of Congress, state and local governments, the President will set our country back on the path to a bright future.  Speaking of future, looking ahead in the schedule, I have some updates on the President’s upcoming travel.  On Thursday, he will travel to Virginia to give remarks aboard the USS Gerald Ford, and participate in a roundtable with military officials, shipbuilders, and community leaders.  Initial guidance for that has already been sent out, and we’ll have updates for credentialed media coming soon.\nOn Friday, the President will attend a listening session on school choice at St. Andrews Catholic School in Florida, and we’ll have guidance for that out soon.  And with that, I’ll take you questions.\nPhil.\nQ    Yeah, Sarah, thanks.  Two things:  First, can you --\nMS. SANDERS:  Of course, let’s not mess with tradition here.\nQ    Very -- they’re simple things.  Can you confirm a discussion that happened with the network anchors about immigration, where apparently the President is now open to a compromise bill on immigration reform, and something he might include in the speech tonight?\nAnd the second point is regarding the State Department budget.  There are some reports out there about possibly a 37 or 38 percent cut to the State Department budget.\nMS. SANDERS:  So I’ll start with the first question.  I was not a participant in the lunch today, so not part of the specific conversation, so I can’t speak to the exact conversation that took place.  But I do know that the President has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he has made clear that he is open to having conversations about that and moving forward.\nRight now, his primary focus, as he had made over and over again, is border control and security at the border, and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe.  And those priorities have not changed.\nQ    And the State Department?\nMS. SANDERS:  And the State Department -- as we said before, I think -- not congressman anymore --- but OMB Director Mulvaney made it pretty clear that the budget priorities that we laid out were just that -- they were priorities.  And right now, we’re in a discussion process.  This is the same historically today that it always works:  We put out our priorities, we lay those out to the departments, they offer feedback to us, and so right now we’re just in a discussion process.  So there’s nothing firm and exact on any numbers that may be coming out of that.\nKristen.\nQ    Two subjects for you.  Kansas -- you started off your remarks talking about it.  Can we expect the President to address that tonight?  And forgetting about what may or may not have been discussed, is the President open to an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship without undocumented immigrants leaving the country?\nMS. SANDERS:  On your first question, I wouldn’t be surprised if that was mentioned in the speech tonight.  In terms of the immigration, again, I haven’t had further conversations with him about that today, but I do know that his priorities have been very clear on immigration, and that’s the number one focus right now.\nQ    One follow on that.  Is it safe to say he wouldn’t --\nMS. SANDERS:  That’s three now.\nQ    -- rule out -- it’s a follow.  It’s a follow-up.\nMS. SANDERS:  Just so you know, I’m not like Sean.  I’m not going to let her set precedents and take three questions from everybody.\nQ    Very quick follow.  Is it safe to say he wouldn’t rule out the possibility of an immigration bill that would not deport people who don’t have criminal records?  In other words, is the focus still on those with criminal records?  And is he very seriously considering some type to carve-out for those who don’t have criminal records?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, the focus is certainly on those with a criminal background and criminal record.  But until I’ve had a chance to have a conversation with the President, I’m not going to speak to that any further.\nSure, go ahead.\nQ    Thank you.  Two questions, of course.  First off, the budget and possible reductions to the State Department.  Would that indicate -- would those reductions indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly out of the White House as opposed to through the State Department and career diplomats?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m sorry, I’m not following what you’re asking here.\nQ    Cuts to the State Department.  There have been reports saying that Secretary Tillerson has been sort of marginalized in a lot of foreign policy discussions going on.  And do these cuts indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly from the White House and not through the State Department?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, I would disagree that Secretary Tillerson has been marginalized.  I think nothing could be further from the truth.  And so I wouldn’t rely on sources outside of the White House in terms of who will be making decisions.  And at this point, the Secretary of State is very much empowered to do that.  Nothing has changed on that front.\nQ    Second question.\nMS. SANDERS:  Go ahead.\nQ    Not to belabor a point, but to follow up on Kristen’s question.  The reports that are out there are still coming in about this conversation that was had today, but is it fair then to say that the President supports at least a compromise immigration bill?  And then just give us a few details on how he’s spending the afternoon in terms of this speech.  Like, is it done?  Is he still tweaking?  Things like that.\nMS. SANDERS:  I love that if we keep asking the same question we think we might get a different answer.  I know.  I appreciate the effort; I think you guys get As for effort.  But again, I’m going to continue to say:  Until I’ve had a chance to have that conversation with the President, I’m not going to speculate on what that would look like.\nIn terms of the afternoon, I know right now he is currently meeting with the people that will be seated with the First Lady.  And this afternoon, he has plans to work through the speech and practice and make any last-minute changes to that.\nGo ahead.\nQ    So those people that he’s meeting with right now, is he going to be directly referencing them in his speech tonight?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think you can rest assured that most of those names will come up in the speech tonight.\nQ    And any idea when the excerpts will be coming out?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think we may have some later this afternoon.  I don’t know that we’ll have the full text of the speech before, but I do believe we’ll have at least some nuggets of the speech that we will release later today.\nShaileagh (ph).\nQ    Thank you.  So first, on the JCC threats, apparently Pennsylvania Attorney General Shapiro is saying that in part of his conversation with the President, the President indicated that these threats may have come from “the reverse\" or \"to make others look bad.”  Do you dispute that characterization of -- what did the President mean by that?  Was he saying that these anti-Semitic threats are coming from -- I don’t know, you tell us.\nMS. SANDERS:  Look, I wasn’t part of a private conversation.  What I do know is the conversations that I have had with the President, he’s been extremely clear and extremely consistent on this topic.  Any act of violence towards people of the Jewish faith is condemned by this administration.  Full stop.\nQ    And then one on healthcare, as well.  There have been -- some Republicans have now come out publicly against the draft plan that is being circulated in Congress on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.  Is the President concerned about the fact that more conservatives are now saying they couldn’t support that plan?  And what is his message to those Republicans?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not at all, because the draft plan is exactly that -- a draft.  It’s meant to open up the conversation.  The last several days the President has spent time with governors, he’s meeting with attorney generals, he’s met with CEOs of major healthcare companies to talk about how they can improve that plan.\nThe big things that he’s made a priority is that we will repeal Obamacare but replace it with something better.  And that’s a lot of what these conversations that he’s had over the last several days are helping to do, is to make that plan better.  And the one that’s been floated out there is nothing more than a draft.\nApril.\nQ    Sarah -- and I want to ask two questions on two different things.  When it comes to inclusion, what is the President talking about tonight when it's inclusion?  Is it about race?  Is it about politics?  What does this inclusion vision or unity vision include?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think it’s very clear, the President has made no secret from the campaign trail through the first month in office that his priority is putting Americans first.  And when he says “Americans,” he means all Americans.  He’s not specifying breaking it out by demographic.  He’s talking about every single American, and I don’t think you can be any more clear when it comes to unity than that -- and inclusion.\nQ    And last question, on HBCUs.  There’s no new money in it, but the people who came to the stakeout, who were in the room for the signing, were talking about a promise of more money.  They’ve been looking forward to more money from (inaudible) Commerce.  What is this next step for them, I guess, to do when it comes to getting more money and this promise beyond what you’re already doing trying to bring the agencies together to pinpoint things (inaudible)?  What is this promise of hope for money?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure on the specific resources, but I do know that the President’s priority here is making sure that the HBCUs have a direct line within the White House and not layers of bureaucracy to have to go through.  And so that conversation has opened up so that he can be part of that directly.  And that’s a big part of moving this group back into the White House outside of the Department of Education.\nQ    So you don’t know anything else about --\nMS. SANDERS:  I do know that there have been a lot of different discussions on how that could happen.  Some of that is through -- all of the different departments have -- there are quite a few departments -- you would be surprised, not just Department of Education, that actually have funding streams for HBCUs, and figuring out how best to streamline that so that more money goes back to the actual colleges and universities.\nJennifer.\nQ    The Pentagon -- that 30-day report yesterday on defeating ISIS.  Can you give us any sort of update on the options presented in that and what the President’s reaction was?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think the President has been very clear, he never lays out a strategy to defeat an enemy.  And that’s exactly what he was asked to get back was a strategy and options.  And I know that that was presented yesterday.\nJim.\nQ    Did the White House reach out to the Pentagon to see what kind of information could be made public about what intelligence was gathered in that Yemen raid?  Do you know if that’s something that occurred?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know we’ve had conversations with people at DOD.  I haven’t been given specifics, but I do know that very clearly it was stated that there was substantial information gathered that was offered.  And I’m trying to figure -- remember exactly how they phrased it -- but actionable items within that information.\nSure, go ahead.\nQ    Just to follow up on immigration, I know you said the focus is still on border security and deporting criminals.  But can we expect the President to actually talk about a call for a broader immigration bill at all in the speech?  Or is that just something you’re saying he’s open to but we’re not going to hear about it tonight?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get in front of the President’s speech tonight, but I do think that you can expect immigration to be mentioned.  But I’ll let him fill you in on the details of what that actually looks like.\nQ    Two questions.  So first, with regard to the anti-ISIS plan, how much of that can we expect to hear from him tonight?  You’re saying that he doesn’t want to kind of reveal the game plan, but it could involve boosting troop numbers perhaps.  I mean, the American people probably would want to know something like that.  So is there anything that’s going to hint to that?\nThe second part is, General McMaster has been reported to say that he didn’t think that the phrase “radical Islamic extremism” is helpful, is a useful term.  So is the President going to try to kind of tone that down in his speech tonight?  Or can we expect to still hear that kind of language used?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know that national security will be a big part of the speech tonight.  And again, I don’t want to get ahead of that, but I think you can certainly anticipate him addressing national security in depth tonight.\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sarah.  A follow-up question about the ISIS review.  Sean yesterday promised a -- I guess more information today on the process, who was involved in drafting this review -- not specifics of what was in it.  And yesterday, the principals committee, when as it actually brought the President?  That's the first one.\nThe second one is, you've spent a lot of time talking about (inaudible) following up on a question earlier.  Does the administration hope that the State Department keeps the special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism?  Or will the White House sort of commit to keeping that position?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yeah, on the first question in terms of the plan and the specifics, luckily we're not all the way through with today.  And it’s going to be a long day, so we've still got plenty of time to get that information to you.  In terms of the second part, I’m not clear on the plan for that, but we’ll check and get back to you on it.\nQ    Just two small, short questions.  Do you have anything on this immigration -- about the skilled laborers?  For example, H-1B visa.  Because there is a group of lawmakers who were in Delhi, and they spoke to Prime Minister Modi who gave -- there is a lot of fear about the H-1B visa being slashed.  So do you have anything on that?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don't have any announcements on that right now.\nQ    And the Indian foreign secretary is in town from today until March 4th.  Any meetings scheduled here?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not that I’m aware of right now, but I’ll check and we’ll get back to you and let you know for sure.\nQ    Sarah, I was wondering if you have any details on the strike that may have killed Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, the al Qaeda number two?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don't have any comments at all.  Not at this time.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sarah.  Two brief questions for you.  One, in at least two of the televised debates during the Republican presidential nomination, candidate Trump made it clear he was for abolishing the Department of Education.  Now he is President, and are there going to be major cutbacks in the Department of Education that have been approved by Secretary DeVos?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure about specific cutbacks.  But I do know that there is a heavy emphasis and priority on moving power away from the federal government to the state and local government.  And I know that that was one of the topics that was discussed yesterday with a lot of the governors that were in town.  Specifically that topic came up.  And I think you can look for ways that we’ll start moving power from the federal government to state and local governments where they're closer to education decisions.  But as far as specific plans, I couldn’t speak to that today.\nQ    So it’s phasing out the department rather than abolishing?\nMS. SANDERS:  I did not say that we were phasing out the department.  I said we were moving power away from the federal government to state and local governments.  But as far as specifics go, I’m sure we’ll be getting to those over the next couple of months.\nQ    My other question is --\nMS. SANDERS:  Sean set me up for the take two here.  (Laughter.)\nQ    The Islamic Resistance Council, one of the best-known groups in opposition to the government in Tehran, recently released documents saying the Quds Force, the Elite Revolutionary Guards in Iran have an extra-territorial division now that is fomenting violence in other countries, including Yemen, Iraq, and Syria.  Is the administration aware of this?  And does it have any comment on it?\nMS. SANDERS:  That's a question I would refer to the NSC, instead of through us.\nQ    In his Fox interview, the President said this morning, \"We will be putting out a replacement plan for Obamacare.”  Who is \"we\"?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, I think it’s no secret he’s been spending a lot of time working with members of Congress, his HHS Secretary, Secretary Price, himself.  And again, he’s had countless meetings over the first few weeks in office with a lot of people that have major influence and major impact, and that a repeal-and-replace plan would impact a lot.  So I think it’s a collective thing.  But primarily the President, the Department of HHS, and Congress.\nQ    Will that be one plan?  Or is it going to be a White House plan and a congressional plan?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don't think we're ready to make that full announcement today, but I definitely know that it’s a collective process that we've been working through.\nJim.\nQ    Just to follow up on that question:  Has there been some warmth shown to the Speaker’s office and to the House Republican proposal?  That's what we're hearing from sources up on the Hill, that they're feeling a little bit better about the way the President is receiving their proposals for repealing and replacing Obamacare.\nMS. SANDERS:  Look, we -- absolutely, this President is very clear he wants to work with Congress.  And we want to make sure that we have the best plan possible.  And I think that requires that all of us come together and work together to make sure we get that.  And that's exactly what we've been doing.\nQ    Can I just follow on that, Sarah?  There are a variety of House Republicans who know that the working draft is dead in the House -- among Republicans for ACA repeal and replace.  And their question is whether they're going to hear from the President something more specific that will help give them cover and lead them forward on ACA, publicly.  So my question to you is:  What is he going to say that might be in the vein that they're talking about -- leading, giving them cover, and describing something in more detail than Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of the President’s speech tonight.  But I do know that he will address Obamacare.  He’ll talk about some of his priorities for the plan, and I’ll let him speak to that later this evening.\nQ    Can I also ask -- Sean said yesterday we could expect a new immigration, travel EO by midweek.  Is that still operable?\nMS. SANDERS:  I would say that's pretty likely.\nFrancesca.\nQ    Thank you, Sarah.  The White House, I’m wondering, if you have a strategy for who is sitting with the President -- or rather with the First Lady in the box -- for instance, Democrats are purposefully bringing DREAMers, they're purposefully brining Muslims to show their opposition to some of the President’s strategy.  So what is the White House’s message with the people that are sitting in the President’s box?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think the primary reason that a lot of times you have people in the box are they're -- that highlight specific parts of the speech and specific parts of the agenda.  And I think you can see the people sitting with him.  It’s pretty obvious the reason that most of them are there.  And he’s laid out those priorities since day one of his administration.  And so I think it’s pretty self-explanatory there, Francesca.\nJordan.\nQ    Thanks, Sarah.  The President’s budget -- even though it’s not complete yet -- has already been running into some significant resistance among Senate Republicans.  Senator McConnell is out there criticizing the State Department cuts.  Senator Graham said it was dead on arrival.  So I just want to know what the White House is doing to talk to these members, maybe assuage their concerns.  Can you give us a picture what’s going on behind the scenes to get support for that document before it comes out?\nMS. SANDERS:  Sure.  I mean, the President met with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell earlier this week to talk about some of those priorities.  But again, this isn’t a final budget.  It’s a draft, and the whole point of it is to receive feedback, work together, and put the best budget forward possible.\nAnd that's exactly what process we're in right now.  Director Mulvaney is focused on doing that.  And I know he’s got a lot of colleagues in the House and Senate, and he’ll be speaking with a lot of those people over the coming weeks as we lead up to rolling out our budget.\nQ    Sarah, the President said he believes that former President Barack Obama is secretly behind these waves of protests that have been coming up these last few weeks.  What tangible evidence is President Trump basing this on?  And when was the last time the two spoke?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’ll let the President’s comments on that stand for itself.  And I’m not sure on the last time they spoke.  I’d have to check on that and get back to you.\nQ    But does the White House believe that President Obama and his people -- like the President is suggesting -- are behind these protests?\nMS. SANDERS:  Look, I think the bottom line here is that we've all condemned the protests.  I think that that's the bigger story here.  And the focus that we should be talking about is that this isn’t something that helps and moves us forward.  And that's what we're focused on right now.\nQ    Two questions -- one is on immigration.\nMS. SANDERS:  The topic of the day.\nQ    In 2014, President Trump, then-citizen Trump, spoke to CPAC and said that he thought immigration in the long term, if there was an immigration reform bill, that it would be a loser for the Republican Party; that the people who could be naturalized through the process would only vote for Democrats.  Has the President come to a different political calculation that if there is a pathway to citizenship for people here illegally, that they could eventually vote for Republicans?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, I haven’t had the chance to talk with the President about this specific policy that we've now asked about multiple times.  But we’ll try to do that and get something to you guys in the next --\nQ    Does the President think that human exploration is something that is important for the -- human space exploration is something that’s important for the country to invest in, in the future?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure if I would say that it’s a top priority.  But I know it’s something that's certainly been discussed.\nThanks, guys.  We look forward to the speech tonight, and we’ll get you some more details.\nQ    (Inaudible) tonight?\nHopefully we’ll have some more information to lay out for you guys later this afternoon.  Thanks.\nEND\n3:33 P.M.

Brady Briefing Room\n1:43 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Wow, that's a crowd.  I hope everyone had a great weekend.  Good afternoon.  Before I begin, I wanted to introduce the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to talk to you a bit about the President's budget.  When Director Mulvaney is finished, we will allow him to take a few questions and then resume the briefing and all the fun that goes with it.\nSo without any further ado, Director Mulvaney.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Thanks very much.  I want to talk for a few minutes about the budget blueprint that most of you know the President started speaking about this morning with the governors.  I'll talk a little bit about what it is and what it isn't, and then talk about where we are in the budget process and what it looks like from here.\nFirst of all, what this isn't:  This is not a full-blown budget.  That will not come until May.  So you're not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan.  This blueprint was never going to be that, as I made clear during my Senate confirmation.  It is a topline number only.\nAs for what it is, these are the President's policies, as reflected in topline discretionary spending.  To that end, it is a true America-first budget.  It will show the President is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he ran for office.  It prioritizes rebuilding the military, including restoring our nuclear capabilities; protecting the nation and securing the border; enforcing the laws currently on the books; taking care of vets; and increasing school choice.  And it does all of that without adding to the currently projected FY 2018 deficit.\nThe top line defense discretionary number is $603 billion.  That's a $54-billion increase -- it's one of the largest increases in history.  It's also the number that allows the President to keep his promise to undo the military sequester.  The topline nondefense number will be $462 billion.  That's a $54-billion savings.  It's the largest-proposed reduction since the early years of the Reagan administration.\nThe reductions in nondefense spending follow the same model -- it's the President keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do.  It reduces money that we give to other nations, it reduces duplicative programs, and it eliminates programs that simply don't work.\nThe bottom line is this:  The President is going to protect the country and do so in exactly the same way that every American family has had to do over the last couple years, and that's prioritize spending.\nThe schedule from here -- these numbers will go out to the agencies today in a process that we describe as passback.  Review from agencies are due back to OMB over the course of the next couple days, and we'll spend the next week or so working on a final budget blueprint.  We expect to have that number to Congress by March 16th.  That puts us on schedule for a full budget -- including all the things I mentioned, this one does not include -- with all the larger policy issues in the first part of May.\nSo with that, I'll take a couple questions.\nYes, sir.\nQ    Mr. Director, in order to get to your topline on the rest of the nondiscretionary -- or rest of the discretionary budget, if you're not going to touch veterans benefits, you need to slice about 12 percent off of the rest of government.  Can't you do that without affecting the services the government provides for --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  And that's part of what this process is this week.  The numbers go out, and the numbers -- each agency will get its topline number along with recommendations from OMB as to how we think they can hit that number.  And they may come back to us and say, yeah, we think that's a good way to reach that number, or they may come back to us with other suggestions.  That's what this process is.\nI think it's fairly unusual for us to be coming to you this early in the process, but we wanted to let everybody know exactly where we were.\nQ    But we're not talking about 2 or 3 percent -- we're talking about double-digit reductions, and that's a lot.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  There's going to be a lot of programs that -- again, you can expect to see exactly what the President said he was going to do.  Foreign aid, for example -- the President said we're going to spend less money overseas and spend more of it here.  That's going to be reflected in the number we send to the State Department.\nQ    Thank you very much.  One quick follow on foreign aid.  That accounts for less than 1 percent of overall spending.  And I just spoke with an analyst who said even if you zero that out, it wouldn't pay for one year of the budget increases that are being proposed right now.  So how do you square that amount?  So why not tackle entitlements, which are the biggest driver, especially when a lot of Republicans over the years have said that they need to be taxed?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Sure.  On your foreign aid, it's the same answer I just gave, which is, yes, it's a fairly part of the discretionary budget, but it's still consistent with what the President said.  When you see these reductions, you'll be able to tie it back to a speech the President gave or something the President has said previously.  He's simply going to -- we are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars.  So we will be spending less overseas and spending more back home.  I forgot your second question.\nQ    On entitlements, why not address entitlements, which is the biggest driver of spending?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  It's very unusual to -- this is a budget blueprint -- what some folks used to call a skinny budget -- and it would not be at all unusual for larger policy decisions, including tax reform, revenue projections not to be included in this budget.  That will come in --\nQ    Down the line?\nQ    Sir --\nQ    Hold on.  So down the line, could we see some type of budget that deals with entitlements?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  The full budget will contain the entire spectrum of the President's proposed policy changes.\nQ    Director, on rebuilding the military, can you talk a little bit about more of the breakdown of that?  Can you go into a little bit more detail?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  No, I can't -- because, again, where we are in this process is that the numbers going to the DOD today and over the course of the next 10 days to two weeks, we'll be coming up with those types of details.\nI've got time for one more.\nQ    Will you be asking the military -- you're going to increase the military budget, but are you going to at least ask the people in the Defense Department to take a look at their budget and say, hey, where can we at least cut or at least look and make sure that we're spending the right amount of money?  Is part of that is going to be part of the process?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Well, absolutely.  That's part of what Secretary Mattis and I have already talked.  He's interested in driving more efficiencies into the Defense Department.  OMB is also going to be involved with him on the procurement process.  All of that will be incorporated in our larger budget in May.\nQ    So it's not just like a blanket -- \"Here, we're going to throw money at you, do what you want\"?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  No, sir.  No, sir.\nLast one.\nQ    Does this account for spending for the President's wall, either in the $30 billion we've heard you're going to request for this year or the $54 billion increase?  Does that include money for the wall, how to pay for the wall?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  It would be more likely -- excuse me, a little bit of both.  We do expect to include some money in a future supplemental for 2017 for the wall, and a 2018 budget will also contain some longer-term dollars for that.\nQ    So it will be split up between the two.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I believe that to be the case.\nThank you all very much.\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you, Director.\nSo let me get back to -- I'll be right there in a second, April.\nThis morning, the President dropped by the National Governors Association meeting, where 49 governors from both states and territories joined Cabinet members and senior White House staff to discuss where they can work together to rebuild the country and restart the economy.\nWhile at the meeting, the President delivered a statement on his forthcoming budget proposal, which he'll submit March 16th, as you just heard the Director mention.  The President's budget will, first and foremost, keep Americans safe.  That means investing in both our nation's physical and financial security.  We will rebuild the nation's military.  An increase in defense spending, including increased funding for our veterans and our border, will be matched by equal reductions in nondefense programs.  The savings in our budget will come from looking at outdated and duplicative programs.  The reductions spending will be sensible and rational, but they will also be tough.\nWith our nation's debt spiraling out of control, we simply must take a look at the way we're spending taxpayers' dollars.  Families across the country are being forced to make difficult choices, because for too long the federal government has not treated their money with the respect they deserve.  The national debt exploded under the last administration from $10.6 billion [trillion] on January 20th, 2009 to $19.9 trillion the day before -- sorry, those are both trillions -- the day before the President's -- President Trump's inaugural.  Every child born in America this year will inherit an average of over $60,000 in debt.  And that, frankly, is too much.\nOur budget will restore respect for taxpayers' dollars while funding all the necessary programs to keep our country safe and prospering.  This meeting with the governors was a continuation of a weekend of engagement and discussion between the governors and the administration.  The President and the First Lady welcomed the governors last night to the White House for the Annual Governors Ball.  And yesterday, the Vice President had a very productive meeting with several governors.\nThe administration is proud to be working with the governors on rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, reforming our healthcare system, and putting Americans back to work.  I know that Obamacare, in particular, was put into place without a lot of input from governors.  We're committed to consulting and including them on this and so many other subjects as we solve the nation's biggest issues together.\nLater this morning, the President had a listening session with some of our country's leading healthcare insurance companies.  Interestingly, on yesterday's ABC \"This Week,\" Minority Leader Pelosi actually laid out a great outline of how to judge Obamacare's success based on what it was supposed to achieve.  She said, \"It had three goals:  One, to lower the cost, the other to expand benefits, and the third to improve and increase access.\"\nSo let's go through her criteria.  Lowering costs:  While this year all four tiers of Obamacare insurance plans are facing double-digit increases in average premiums.  Just to take a look at one set of premiums, for standard silver plans in the states, 63 percent increase in Tennessee, 69 percent increase in Oklahoma, and a staggering 116 percent increase in Arizona.\nOn expanding benefits:  In reality, the new law’s mandates have led to max cancellations of coverage, soaring out-of-pocket costs, and declining enrollment figures.  Millions are choosing to pay a tax over buying the government-mandate insurance.\nIncreased access:  With insurance fleeing the marketplace, Americans are facing a dwindling number of insurance choices with 17 percent of Americans left with only one insurer option available in their exchange.  Insurers will be indispensable partners in the transition period out of Obamacare into the Patients First plan the President will be working with Congress to put in its place.  The President’s plan will encourage innovation, modernize our healthcare system, and provide immediate relief, and ensure access to quality, truly affordable care.\nThis afternoon, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence and Ambassador Haley.  Afterwards, he’s having a meeting with Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell.  And then following that, he’s going to be meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson.  The Secretary is coming off a very successful trip to Mexico that -- he was joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly.  I’m sure the President is looking forward to discussing that trip with the Secretary.\nAlso this afternoon, the Vice President will be speaking to an extraordinary group of 60 presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  There will be a pool spray at the top of the event, and the Vice President’s office will release his remarks and photos following the event.  We can also expect a meeting with the President with them as well.\nThis evening, the President will have dinner with regional press affiliates that are going to be in town for the joint session of Congress.  While it’s tradition for representatives from the networks to meet with the President before his joint address, this is the first time, to my knowledge at least, that the opportunity has been expanded to include representation from 18 regional outlets from around the country.\nTomorrow, the President will also have the traditional lunch with the network anchors.  Beyond the so-called \"big five\" networks, we’ve also opened it up and invited outlets including Telemundo, Univision, CBN, EWTN, OANN, PBS, C-SPAN, and TV1.\nTonight, the President looks forward to seeing his nominee for the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, confirmed by the Senate.  Secretary-designate Ross has been an important champion for U.S.-struggling industries in the private sectors.  And pending his confirmation this evening, he’ll now do in the same post on behalf of the American people what he has done in private sector.  Assuming everything goes according to the plan in the Senate tonight, we expect to have his swearing-in tomorrow here at the White House.\nAlso tomorrow, the President will deliver his first address to both houses of Congress.  In his speech, the President will lay out an optimistic vision for the country, crossing traditional lines of party, race, socioeconomic status.  As I said before, the theme will be the renewal of the American spirit.  He will invite Americans of all backgrounds to come together in the service of a stronger and brighter future for our nation.\nIn addition to laying out the concrete steps the President has already taken to make the American Dream possible for all of our people, he will talk about the bold agenda -- he wants to work with Congress.  This includes tax and regulatory reform to provide relief to hardworking Americans and their businesses, making the workplace better for working parents, ensuring the families who have suffered under Obamacare’s skyrocketing rates see it replaced with a patient-centered alternative, making sure every child in America has access to a good education, a rebuilding of our military and fulfilling of our commitments to veterans to whom we obviously owe a great deal of gratitude.\nYou can expect to see a speech grounded firmly in solving real problems for every American -- how can we make sure that every American who needs a better job get one, how can we get kids who are trapped in failing schools into better ones, how we can keep gangs and drug violence out of our neighborhoods and communities.  The President will address the Americans who have been waiting for help from their leaders for too long, and let them know that help is finally on the way.\nWith respect to the speech, we will be having a background briefing sometime this evening here in the briefing room.  We will provide additional details later in the afternoon.\nAs you might already know, the Department of Defense presented its preliminary plan to the White House today to defeat ISIS.  This plan has been delivered by Secretary Mattis, who is currently briefing the principals on the option presented today in seeking their input and feedback.\nFinally, I wanted to note the President continues to be deeply disappointed and concerned by the reports of further vandalism at Jewish community -- Jewish cemeteries, rather.  The cowardly destruction in Philadelphia this weekend comes on top of similar accounts from Missouri and threats made to Jewish community centers around the country.  The President continues to condemn these and any other form of anti-Semitic and hateful acts in the strongest terms.  From our country’s founding, we’ve been dedicated to protecting the freedom of our citizens' rights to worship.  No one in America should feel afraid to follow the religion of their choosing freely and openly.  The President is dedicated to preserving this originating principle of our nation.\nAnd while we’re at it, I don’t want to get ahead of the law enforcement, but I was asked the other day about the story in Kansas -- the shooting in Kansas.  And while the story is evolving, early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing.\nSo with that, I’ll be glad to take your questions.  Jon.\nQ    Sean, there’s a report this morning that you reached out directly to CIA Director Pompeo.  Did you directly contact Director Pompeo and ask him to knock down the New York Times story on the Russia connection?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jon.  Let me kind of, if I may, walk through the entire timeline.  I think it’s important.\nAs I mentioned I think a week ago, the New York Times published a story about what they called “contacts” between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  The FBI deputy director was at a meeting here at the White House that morning.  After the meeting concluded, he asked the chief of staff to stand back a second, he wanted to tell him that the report in the New York Times was “BS.”  For viewers at home, I think you can pretty much figure what that means, but I’ll leave it at that.\nAt that time, the chief of staff said, thank you for sharing that with me, can we let other people know that the story is not accurate.  Throughout the day, they went back and forth to see what they thought was appropriate.  Finally, came to the conclusion that they did not want to get in the process of knocking down every story that they had issues with.\nThey then -- we then were informed that other people had come to the same conclusions, including -- at that time, Chairman Devin Nunes had told us, hey, I’ve been knocking this down, telling reporters.  We shared a number with him of a reporter that had contacted us.  And again, when the reporters contact us and we said, no, that’s not -- to the best of our knowledge that’s not true, they were asking us, can you point to -anybody else that can substantiate this?  And I think we did a good job of saying, sure, we will share with reporters other people who have come to the same conclusion.\nSo I won't go into the specifics.  I will say that I think we did our job very effectively by making sure that reporters who had had questions about the accuracy and the claims made in The New York Times, that we were pointing them to subject-matter experts who understood whether or not that story was accurate or not.  And I think just to continue to be very, very clear on this -- it was about the accuracy of the reporting and the claims that were made in there, plain and simple -- about whether or not a story that appeared in The New York Times was accurate.  And individual after individual continued to say that, as far as they knew, they weren’t.\nI think most of you probably saw Chairman Nunes's comments this morning.  He was very clear, number one, that he reached out to us to say, I've been telling people, reporters, that these allegations and descriptions in The New York Times are not accurate.  And then we shared that information with him.  But he came to us to share that he equally had that issue brought up to him, he was briefed and saw \"no evidence\" that the story was accurate.\nSo the answer is, we have continued to give reporters information and sources that went to the accuracy, or lack thereof, of a report that was in a newspaper.  And I think Chairman Nunes also equally said it's interesting how we literally were engaging with the press, saying, if you have a question about the sourcing on this -- obviously, when brought to our attention, we said, it's not accurate as we know, but then most of you and your colleagues who had inquired would say, well, that's great, I'm sure you're saying this, but who else can corroborate this?  So our job was to continue to -- when informed -- share sources who had equally come to the same conclusion that the Times story was not accurate.\nQ    You don’t think there's something strange about -- something odd about the White House Press Secretary getting the CIA director on the phone to knock down a story about an investigation?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, but see, respectfully, you're using words like \"knock down.\"  There was a story in a newspaper --\nQ    Was it disputed?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  No, no -- there was reporters coming to us saying, there is a story out there, what's your take on it?  And our answer was, we don’t believe it's accurate, we don’t* [do] believe it's false.  But obviously that's our take on it.  And reporters were saying to us, well, is there anybody that you can point to to substantiate this claim?\nNow, remember, this all started with the FBI coming to us, bringing to our attention, saying that the story in the Times was not accurate -- in fact, it was BS -- and all we did was simply say, that's great, could you tell other reporters the same thing you're telling us?  And I would think that other reporters, yourself included, would think that that would be a helpful thing to get the story straight.  All we sought to do was to actually get an accurate report out.  And again, I think Chairman Nunes this morning, over and over and over and over again, made it very clear that no evidence that has been brought to his attention suggests that that reporting was accurate.\nSo, respectfully, I think it's interesting that I'm being asked what's appropriate when what we're doing is actually urging reporters to engage with subject-matter experts who can corroborate whether or not something is accurate or not.\nQ    Should there be a special prosecutor?  Darrell Issa has called for a special prosecutor to look into this.\nMR. SPICER:  And I guess my question would be, a special prosecutor for what?\nQ    To look into the whole Russia connection, the whole Russia influencing --\nMR. SPICER:  And here's my -- right.  And I guess my --\nQ    I mean, he was part of the campaign, so -- I mean, Sessions was part of the campaign, the Attorney General.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand.  But here's my question, Jonathan:  We have now for six months heard story after story come out about unnamed sources say the same thing over and over again, and nothing has come of it, right?  We've heard the same people, the same anecdotes, and we've heard reports over and over again.  And as Chairman Nunes made very clear today, he has seen nothing that corroborates that.  So at what point -- you got to ask yourself, what are you investigating?\nQ    Well, Russian interference -- I mean, beyond the context.\nMR. SPICER:  No, and I think that both the House and the Senate have looked at it.  You know as well as I do that the intelligence community has looked at it as well.  There's a big difference.  I think that Russia's involvement in activity has been investigated up and down.  So the question becomes at some point, if there's nothing to further investigate, what are you asking people to investigate?\nI mean, Chairman Nunes spoke very clearly today when asked over and over and over again about all of this, and said that he has seen nothing that leads him to believe that there's there.  The President has spoken forcefully time and time again that he has no interests in Russia, he hasn’t talked to people in Russia in years, and yet you keep asking -- and when I say \"you,\" collectively -- to try to find something that seemingly, at least the reporting that I'm seeing in different organizations, suggests that there's nothing new that's being reported.  It's the same stuff over and over again that we've heard for literally six months.  And so the question becomes at some point, what do you need to further investigate if there is nothing that has come out?\nQ    Can you not categorically deny there were no contacts between the Russians and anybody on the campaign?\nMR. SPICER:  I can't deny -- I can't -- I guess my question is --\nQ    That's what the investigation would look at.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And I guess my point is, is that you've had the intelligence community look at Russia's involvement in the election.  You had the House and Senate both do the same.  And so what I'm trying to ascertain is that at what point -- how many people have to say that there's nothing there before you realize there's nothing there?  I can't say unequivocally -- all I'm saying is, the people who have done the investigating about Russia overall and its activities in the United States, specifically now with respect to our election, haven’t provided anything that leads me to believe or should lead you to believe -- and I continue to see reports coming from -- there were media sources saying when they checked in with law enforcement, or intelligence community sources, there's nothing more than has been previously reported over and over again.\nSo, at some point, you do have to ask yourself, what are you actually looking for?  How many times do you have to come to the same conclusion before you take the answer?  And that's where I -- Mara.\nQ    Just to be clear, did you -- just to follow up on that, did you personally reach out to Pompeo?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm not going to discuss what we did internally.  I'm just going to say that when we shared -- we did our job about making sure that when people had -- reporters had questions, we let them know what subject-matter experts were available to discuss the accuracy of the newspaper story.\nMara.\nQ    Yeah, I'm sure people will come back to this, but I actually have a budget question, which is:  During the campaign, the President said he was not going to touch Medicare or Social Security.  His Treasury Secretary repeated that.  It sounded like the OMB Director was leaving that as an open question, TBD.  I'm just wondering, what's the state of the promise?  That we won't touch it for current retirees --\nMR. SPICER:  What the OMB Director made clear is how it works.  The budget is dealing with the topline discretionary numbers.  Policy decisions are not part of the budget.  That was what he was being asked and what he -- so I just want to be clear in terms of what it was.  And again, I think --\nQ    -- the state of the promise.  In other words what is the promise.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And I think the state of the promise is clear.  And I think, as you point out, he had made the promise, he stands by the promise.  The Treasury Secretary --\nQ    But what is the promise?  Current retirees?  People near retirement?  Anybody paying into --\nMR. SPICER:  I will follow up specifically on that.  But I think the President has made very clear that it's not his intent to do -- he wants to focus on the discretionary side; that entitlement reform is not -- that, with respect to those programs that he mentioned, he stands by his word.\nFred.\nQ    I wanted to ask a couple issues.  An executive order on religious freedom had previously been in the works.  Will that still come?  And if it does, will it extend beyond religious freedom?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry, Fred, what?\nQ    Will it extend beyond the Johnson Amendment?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we've discussed executive orders in the past, and for the most part we're not going to get into discussing what may or may not come until we're ready to announce it.  So I'm sure as we move forward we'll have something.\nOlivier.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.\nQ    I'm sorry, just one more.  The issue of types of reforms.  Will there be -- how committed is the administration to a border adjustment tax?  And is there any concern that there won't be enough conservative support for that; that it could block any meaningful tax reform long-term?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I'm not going to get into the specifics of tax reform today.  The President has made clear that we'll have an outline of the plan very soon.  But what I will say is that I think he has talked about the concerns that he has with current regulatory and tax policy that benefit people from moving out of the country and shipping jobs -- or products back in while shedding American workers.  He will continue to fight for policies that promote manufacturing and job creation in the United States, and supports American workers.\nSo I don’t want to get ahead of the exact nature of the policy.  He has been seeking a lot of input.  As I mentioned earlier, he's going to talk today with Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell.  I know that both the joint session, the status of repeal and replace, and I'm sure some discussion of tax reform will probably come up.  But there's a lot -- we're continuing to move forward and work with them.\nOlivier.\nQ    Thanks.  A couple on the ISIS strategy.  Can you just get to the timetable from now, now that you received it -- what happens?  And there's a report that you're asking for $30 billion in emergency defense spending on top of the $54 [billion] in the budget.  Is that true?  Does that cover the new ISIS strategy?  Can you explain what's different between the two?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Right now, literally, that principals meeting -- or principals meeting that I mentioned at the beginning is happening as we speak.  So Secretary Mattis was coming over to brief the principals as far as the ISIS plan.  And again, part of it was to make sure that he fully discusses the recommendations that he's making and seek the input and feedback of the other principals downstairs.  That can help guide where we go from here, how we go.  With respect to the funding, I think Director Mulvaney noted that there will be a supplemental at some point.  Right now the focus is on the budget, and then we'll go from there.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Two brief questions.  First, I read your statement at the Thursday briefing to Governor Malloy of Connecticut during the NGA meeting.  And he responded -- and I quote -- \"Sean didn’t read a thing that I said.\"  He said that he -- in Connecticut, they are already working to get criminals who are in the country illegally out.  His objection was to going into warming centers or schools where officials might frighten children.  Your response to the Governor on that?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I was asked specifically what his stance -- what the comments were with respect to sanctuary cities.  And again, I would reiterate, with all due respect to the Governor, I'm not here to pick a fight with the Governor.  I enjoyed my time going to school in the state of Connecticut.  I have a kind affection of the Nutmeg State.  But the reality is, I think that there's a difference.  Whether or not what he wants to do is state funds, maybe -- without knowing the exact nature of how he's funding, what he's funding, it's difficult.  The question I was asked at the time was on how we would be handling it.  And I think the answer, whether it's Connecticut or California, is that the President's executive order and the President's commitment is to make sure that tax dollars are not used to support programs that are helping people who are not in the country legally and who are not citizens entitled to them.\nQ    One more question, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.  Starting early.  (Laughter.)\nQ    For 58 years, when Presidents have gone to Rome, they've always met the Pope, going back to when President Eisenhower met Pope John XXIII.  Now, one year ago this week, candidate Trump had a disagreement with this Pope and an exchange of words.  When he goes to Rome in May for his first European trip, will he meet with this Pope?\nMR. SPICER:  That's a great question.  Obviously, I would be a huge fan of that.  But I'm not going to -- I don’t think we're at that place in the planning process to make an announcement on any visits with the Pope.\nBlake.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  Two budget questions, if you don’t mind.  Mr. Mulvaney, I believe, just said that what the administration plans on putting forward doesn’t add to the current deficit projection, which the CBO says is about $560 billion.  But he didn't say that it would significantly draw from that either.  So my first question is, is the administration comfortable putting something forward that might rack up deficits of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think -- I'm trying to understand the question a little, if you can help me with this.  Because he --\nQ    He said it wasn’t going to add to it.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    So my question is, he didn't necessarily say it was going to cut from it, either.  If it doesn't cut from it, potentially it could be hundreds of billions in deficit.  And I'm curious --\nMR. SPICER:  Right, no, but I think -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I mean, he basically made it very clear it doesn't add to the projected baseline deficit.  So that continues to be the goal.  And I think as we continue to work through this process, the passback, you know, it can work both ways.  We could identify further savings and reductions through working with the agencies and departments, but we're going to make sure that the topline number we maintain is as close to that as possible.\nAnd as we go through this -- I mean, this is the beginning of the process as the director noted.  We send the number to the department or the agency, give them some ideas, how we came up with this, and then they come back to us and either justify why a particular program or office, or what have you, needs to stay in existence or why maybe not the reduction that is offered.  But it's a back-and-forth process that will occur over the next few weeks.  So to get ahead of it is the problem.\nQ    Let me ask you what Nancy Pelosi -- to just get a quick reaction to Nancy Pelosi.  She put out a statement and said the following:  \"Five weeks into his administration, President Trump has not introduced a single jobs bill.\"  Your reaction to that would be what?\nMR. SPICER:  He's created a lot of jobs.  I think that's -- he's continuing to work with Congress on both repealing and replacing Obamacare, tax reform.  And, fundamentally, both of those two items alone I think can help spur a lot of economic growth.  The meetings that we've had with the CEOs, the health insurers -- there are so many things that are both job-killing and that can be done to help promote a better regulatory and tax climate that lead to job creation.\nI think that's one of the biggest problems right now is that people in Washington aren't necessarily talking to job creators and saying, what is the impediment that you have to hiring more American workers?  What are the impediments that you have to manufacturing more, to building here?\nThe meetings and the actions that the President has taken on both regulatory and other matters have helped spur job creation.  You've heard these companies come in over and over again -- the automakers, airlines, Sprint -- I mean, the list goes on and on and on of people saying to the President, because of your agenda, because of your vision, we're willing to commit to hiring additional people to manufacturing more.  That's how jobs are created -- it's not through the government.  And too often, it's the government regulations that stifle and prevent job creation.  And I think the President, as a businessman, fully appreciates and understands how this works and what some of those impediments do to creating jobs and to growing the economy.\nAnd so I would just say that you haven't seen anything yet.  It's going to continue to be the case.\nTrey.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Is there concern in the administration that a large-scale military buildup will appear threatening to other countries around the world and lead to some sort of arms race with other countries?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think when you look at the state of some of the infrastructure in our military, whether it's the age of our ships or our planes or some of the other hardware that exists, you recognize that we need to rebuild a lot of these things.  The size of our Navy has gone down significantly.  And there are new needs and new -- and when you look at the commitment that you have to make not just in one year but in several years, for a lot of these programs -- ships and tanks, even weapons systems -- they don't get built in a month or a day.  You have to make a commitment early on to make the investment because of the time that it takes to procure them, to build them, the research and development that goes into it.\nAnd so I would just suggest to you that this is the first step in making sure we make the commitment to a military that through, especially through the sequester the last few years, has not gotten the funding it needs to get off life support.  There are a lot of things that are being taken care of for the military where they're just continuing to -- they're not putting the systems and the projects in place to allow the military to keep up with the times, and that's a problem.\nMajor.\nQ    Sean, one investigation question and one budget question.  As you may be aware, Bill Owens, the father of William \"Ryan\" Owens, gave an interview with the Miami Herald over the weekend and he said, \"The government owes my son an investigation.\"  On behalf of the President of the United States, is the President open to an investigation to the raid in Yemen?  And the father of Ryan Owens called that a \"stupid\" mission.  Is there something that you'd like to communicate to him about that mission that might persuade him otherwise?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, thank you.  That's multi-part, so let me kind of walk through it slowly.\nFirst of all, I can't possibly imagine what he's going through in terms of the loss of his son.  I can tell him that on behalf of the President, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I've said before, is going to safe American lives.  It's going to protect our country more.\nSo he made a sacrifice to this country.  He was on his 12th deployment.  And I know that his wife, when she spoke to the President, knows that he did this because he loved it, he cared about our nation.  And the mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation.  It obtained a lot of information that will help us keep safe.\nWith respect to his request, it is standard operating procedure for the Department of Defense to undergo what they call a 15-6 review.  That review, in this case, is three-pronged.  Because there was a fatality and a loss of life, there's that.  Because there were civilians involved, that's another.  And then third is because there was hardware -- a helicopter that was damaged.  That is a separate.  So, in fact, there will be three reviews done by the Department of Defense because of the nature of this.\nBut, again, I can't stress enough that on behalf of the President, on behalf of this nation, we express our condolences, extend our prayers to him during this time.\nQ    As you said, that is standard procedure.  Is there anything the President is particularly curious about with this mission, in that it was brought to him, he authorized it quickly?  Does he believe in the main it was carried out well and there's nothing that he's particularly curious about in the way either the helicopter was damaged, fatality, the civilian casualties -- anything of the like?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, number one, I've walked through the timetable previously in terms of how long this had been planned for, dating well back into the previous administration.  And as you know, their recommendation at the time was to wait for a moonless night.  That night wasn't going to occur during President Obama's administration.  And so when General Mattis got into the Department of Defense, he was briefed up on the status of the thing, made aware of when the next time was go.  We went through the process to ensure that we continued to believe that the mission -- the way it was going to be conducted and the results of the mission would be worthy of action.\nThe conclusion continued to be, as it was prior, that we should move forward.  As I mentioned before, I think you can't ever say that, when there's most importantly loss of life and people injured, that it's 100 percent successful.  But I think when you look at what the stated goal of that mission was -- it was an information- and intelligence-gathering mission.  And it achieved its objectives.\nSo, again, I would express our thoughts and our prayers and our condolences to all of the people in Chief Owens's family and his friends, his shipmates.  But it's something that, as a SEAL and as somebody who deployed 12 times, he knew that this was part of the job and he knew what he was doing.  And so we're very comfortable with how the mission was executed, and we'll let the Department of Defense go through that review process and then see where that leads us.\nBut I think to get ahead of the three separate reviews that are being done by the Department of Defense would be probably a little irresponsible at this time.\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Major gets two, too.\nQ    Just real quick on the budget.  As you're aware, to undo the defense sequester, you have to get 60 votes in the Senate because you have a separate domestic sequester number and defense.  Are you confident with these numbers and with this kind of heavy discretionary spending cut proposed, you can get the 60 votes to change the law?  Because without that change in law, the proposal is just that -- it doesn't become operational.\nMR. SPICER:  I think that when it comes to our nation's security, specifically our nation's military, I don't think that it's a partisan issue.  I think that senators from across the country -- whether you're talking about Florida or whether you've got an Army installation or a Navy base, you understand the state of repair that many of our planes, ships and other hardware is in.  And I think that there is a bipartisan commitment to give the military and its members the equipment and the tools it needs to succeed and protect this country.  So I do feel confident.\nApril.\nQ    Sean, I have a couple of budgetary questions for you.  One, at the press conference, President Trump talked about the fix for inner cities.  What is the investment in this budget when it comes to a fix for inner cities?\nMR. SPICER:  It's a good try.  I think the Director was very clear --\nQ    That's one --\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, part of the process today was to start that passback process that he talked about, where we're going to the various departments, whether it's HUD or DOT, and giving them that topline number and then hearing back.  So I don't want to get into a specific number with you before we get too far down the process.  I think that's a conversation that we're going to have with the agencies and then we will have subsequently with Congress when they start drafting their resolutions.\nQ    Okay, a follow-up on this, but I do have a question on HBCUs.  See, he talked about healthcare.  He talked about education and he talked about crime.  He needs to talk about Chicago and law enforcement.  So you don't have any kind of budgetary numbers when it comes to it?  And healthcare is a piece that is one of the line items for this budget.\nMR. SPICER:  That's right.  And I'm not saying that we don't have numbers.  I'm saying that we're not giving them out.  That's a big difference.\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER:  I know.  (Laughter.)  You're going to do a good job trying.  (Laughter.)\nBut as the Director noted on this, that they have come up with topline numbers based on their going through each of these agencies’ budget, and saying, hey, there’s a duplicative program here.  In some cases, maybe they give them more, maybe they give them less.  Part of it is to begin that conversation, that process, with the departments and agencies to figure out what those investments are.  Maybe it’s repurposing existing funds in a different way.\nSo it’s not necessarily a zero-sum game.  There is a way that a department can reallocate money to a program that might end up benefitting because there is a duplicative or out-of-date program or office that that savings could be applied to something.  But I don’t want to get ahead of the process right now, only to say that we are at the very beginning of it.\nQ    And one on HBCUs.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    The President is going to see the 80-plus presence of HBCUs with the Vice President today.  Some of them are very concerned as to what this executive order looks like, and they are waiting to hear the commitment before they say, \"I’m all in.\"  What is the commitment that this President is trying to make when it comes to HBCUs to ensure, I guess, their future, or deal with funding for research projects, what have you, or moving it out of the Department of Education to the purview of the White House?  What is the commitment that he’s going to give to them?\nMR. SPICER:  So, look, I don’t generally speak about executive orders until they’re finalized.  I will just say that one of the things that I think there’s commitment from this White House to do is to look at the various resources throughout the federal government that support HBCUs.\nSo, for example, the Department of Defense has ROTC and NROTC programs.  Are they being properly -- is that funding being properly executed and spent.  There’s programs within each of the departments -- the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- that affect grants or programs or direct funding that go to HBCUs for various different things, whether it’s construction projects, or teaching programs, or mentorship programs.  Whatever it is, they span throughout the entire government.\nAnd I think that what we are committed to doing is ensuring that there is a high level of understanding and commitment, that goes straight to the President, of how we harness those resource within the government, and make sure that they’re doing what they’re supposed to be doing.\nSo it’s one thing to have them, right, spread throughout the different departments.  It’s another thing to make sure that there’s a direct pipeline to the President of the United States that those programs are being executed in a way that’s benefitting the future of HBCUs and the various projects and teaching that goes on there.\nQ    And so what are you saying -- there’s going to be a piece that is going to basically go throughout all the agencies to make sure that there is some kind of commitment to HBCUs and contract of like, let's say engineering for some schools, or in research for other schools?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I would say -- I think I’m going to stick to waiting until we announce it to get out a lot more.\nQ    Is that today or tomorrow?\nMR. SPICER:  I anticipate it very soon.  How is that?  I want to give myself a little wiggle room.\nPhil Rucker.\nQ    Yeah, Sean, thanks.  A budget-related question, but on infrastructure.  The President has repeatedly, including today, again, called for a major infrastructure plan to the tune a trillion dollars -- roads, bridges, tunnels, you name it.  Can you explain where that money is going to come from, how it fits into the budget that's under review right now, and what the timeline for that project would be?\nMR. SPICER:  So I think that would be part of a longer-term discussion that we’re having with Congress.  As you know, the President got in office 30-some-odd days ago.  The idea of getting a budget is -- you know, it’s commonly referred to as a skinny budget -- is to get the government to continue to be funding and it will be something that we’ll work with Congress.\nI understand your point.  The President continues to talk about the status --\nQ    -- a priority for him.\nMR. SPICER:  It is.  Absolutely.  But I think that we’ve got to make sure that it’s done right and that we work with Congress.  I think, as you correctly mention, there’s obviously a funding mechanism to this.  And we’ve already talked about things like comprehensive tax reform that could add to that discussion.\nAnd so I just -- I understand what you’re asking in terms of how this would be funded and when it will be coming, and the pay-fors, but we’re working with Congress to have that discussion.  I think that comes probably outside of the budget discussion.\nQ    And so how does he square that with the need to tighten the belt, which he also talked about today -- we’ve been spending too much as a government and we need to cut our spending?\nMR. SPICER:  Right, but I think -- but in the same manner that we’re presenting the budget.  So we’re talking about adding $54 million -- $54 trillion, rather -- a billion dollars to -- thank you.  Appreciate the help here.  (Laughter.)\nBut we’re looking to add that to defense.  And so what it means is that we have to look through other programs to find reductions in savings.  I think that same kind of discussion would happen with respect to infrastructure, not necessarily the savings piece, but the funding piece; that there’s several ways -- and I know that there’s a lot of discussion, private-public partnerships that he is started to have a discussion with in terms of the funding mechanism.\nAnd so all I’m trying to get at is that there are various ways to do this funding without just relying on the American taxpayer in terms of additional taxes.  There are spending reductions, there are other funding mechanisms, and I think, in due course, we will get around to that discussion.\nQ    And just related to that, he mentioned in his remarks about infrastructure today that as he drives through the Queens-Midtown tunnel and the Lincoln tunnel, he worries about ceiling tiles falling.  Is there a specific incident he was talking about where people have been injured, or is that just a fear of his?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know.  I’ll ask.  (Laughter.)  But I’m sure Secret Service will take care of the -- alleviating the medium concerns.\nHold on.  Alexis.\nQ    Sean, I have two questions.  First, one on healthcare.  Because the OMB director was signaling that the complete budget would be made ready early May, and the President today described how complicated he had discovered that the healthcare repeal and replace has become, can you describe when it is that the President would present his framework for an overhaul of healthcare?  Is it going to be included in the budget so we would see it before May?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t think you’re going to see it in the budget, no.  That’s not the appropriate vehicle for it.  I think I’ve mentioned it before.  I think you would drive -- or at least the leading option, before I get locked into something, is to add Obamacare to the FY17 budget process and put it through reconciliation.  So that would happen outside of the current budget structure.\nBut I think he has also been very clear that he wants this outline within a matter of weeks, and that we continue to have these discussions with House and Senate leadership, with Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce, and then similar on Senate finance on the Senate side.\nSo when he talks to Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell today, I’m sure that conversation will continue.\nQ    Just to follow up on healthcare, because not every ingredient in the Affordable Care Act can be handled in reconciliation.  That’s why I was asking about the elements of it that we see in the budget.\nMR. SPICER:  That’s right.\nQ    So we will see some of those?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, there’s several pieces of Obamacare.  Some can be done by executive order, some get done with 50 votes, some have to be done specifically in reconciliation.  I think counter to Major’s point on a previous question, that there are certain things that have to be done in certain ways legislatively, and to create a comprehensive and holistic approach to both repealing it and replacing it.  And we’re aware of that.  We’re working with the House and the Senate to make that happen.\nQ    And my second topic.\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.\nQ    All right.  The immigration executive order, the travel ban -- is the President going to address the American people and Congress in his speech tomorrow night and specifically describe and defend the immigration ban?  And when will we see the revised executive order?\nMR. SPICER:  So we’re not going to -- I would not anticipate the speech being a defense of legislation and executive orders.  I don’t think many previous Presidents have gotten through and used that as a legislative walkthrough.\nBut you will hear about his commitment to immigration and his desire for border security, and what it means not just about keeping the nation safe, but what impact it’s having on the economy.  So you will hear a lot about immigration tomorrow night, and he will talk about why it matters and the goal that we have and why we should come together on areas like this.\nQ    Can I follow up on that, Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  Katelyn.\nQ    Where’s the next order?\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, I’m sorry.  The next order I think we should have it out probably middle of this week.  Looking towards the middle of the week.  And we’ll have further updates as we get through the schedule.  I think obviously our priority right now today was the really get the budget process kicked off, and then continue to prepare for the joint session.\nKatelyn.\nQ    Thank you.\nQ    Sean, can I follow on that?\nMR. SPICER:  You will in a second.\nQ    An internal report in 2015 identified $125 billion in wasteful Pentagon spending.  So how can you justify adding $54 billion to the defense budget?  Is that going to go to hiring soldiers or bureaucrats or contractors?  And is the President concerned with wasteful spending at the DOD?\nMR. SPICER:  Of course he’s concerned.  He’s concerned with wasteful spending throughout the government.  But I think there’s also a big difference between rooting out waste and fraud in various programs and offices, and understanding that when you’re talking about adding to the fleet or increasing airplane costs, that that can’t be driven just through those.  And the commitment that you have to make to purchase some of those very-needed upgrades to our infrastructure and to our arsenal and to planes and ships doesn’t just come through that.  Because even if you could start to really identify, you really wouldn’t be able to make the financial commitment that needs to be done to rebuild some of the ships and planes in particular that need a substantial investment on the front end.\nJohn.\nQ    If I could just follow on Alexis’s question.  The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has just denied your request to suspend proceedings in regard to the initial executive order.  That order came out just within the last few minutes.  So do you plan to continue defending your first executive order in court?  And what’s the purpose of doing that as opposed to simply rescinding it and then rendering that case moot?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I haven’t been able to read my phone while this has happened.  So I --\nQ    That's why I read --\nMR. SPICER:  (Laughter.)  Thank you, I appreciate it.  So with all due respect, I would ask that I be able to get back to you tomorrow on that after we consult with the Counsel’s Office and go through the briefing and the -- excuse me, the reading of what the court has said.  But give me a little time, let me get off the podium --\nQ    I mean, the rescinding it question still stands, regardless of the --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that, and I think that the President has made a commitment right now to continue to defend what we did.\nQ    For what reason?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  Because this is the strategy that -- he believes that we have the authority vested in U.S. code.  I’ve talked about this extensively in the past.  And I think that if you’ll allow me, once we get done with the briefing, I will follow up with the Counsel’s Office.\nQ    But the point that some of us are trying to understand is, if you have a new executive order that you believe addresses the concerns of the many courts who have weighed in on this, why continue to defend an executive order that --\nMR. SPICER:  Because he’s -- I mean, because we were right the first time.  And I think that --\nQ    Are you trying to prove a point?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on -- no, but I think that it’s not a question of proving a point.  It’s that the manner in which it was done in the first place was what we believe and continue to believe was the right way to address this problem.\nAnd while the second executive order attempts to address the court’s concerns that they made, the goal is obviously to maintain the way that we did it the first time because we believe that the law is very clear about giving the President the authority that he needs to protect the country.\nSo just dropping that is not necessarily the most prudent thing.  And I think part of it is for us to recoup right now, figure out what the court has said, and then reassess the strategy.  But I don't want to get ahead, as you point out, you're reading it to me now -- I would like the opportunity to maybe go read it and actually have a lawyer read it -- since that won’t do very much.\nGo ahead.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  On anti-Semitism, that was a good, strong statement.  Is there anything that the federal government can do to protect Jewish institutions?  Are there any leads who is doing this?  And also on sequester, when can sequester be lifted?\nMR. SPICER:  When can it be lifted?\nQ    Yes.\nMR. SPICER:  I think we've got to go through the process to lift the sequester, and so we’ll deal with that.\nWith respect to some of the activity that we've seen at Jewish cemeteries in particular -- look, I think we have to work with law enforcement at a local and state level.  I’ll leave it to the Department of Justice to comment further on what additional steps can be made.  But I think -- as has been pointed out multiple times, I think one of the things that we can do is speak from this podium, in particular, and other places to make sure that every American understands what our values are, and that that kind of behavior and activity is wrong and won’t be tolerated, and the highest levels of government denounce it.\nSo I think it starts at that.  And then I think there’s a law enforcement component that I would ask you to touch base with.\nQ    Sean, two on the budget.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    I understand this is a blueprint.  I understand the President has previously said he doesn't want to touch entitlements.  But why does he think it’s the right move to break with years of Republican orthodoxy, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have said that any sensible long-term budget needs to include entitlement reform?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I’m just going to -- I think the President understands the commitment that was made to seniors in particular and that it's a sacred bond and a trust.\nAnd I think -- look, Mara asked this earlier -- I think let me get back to you on the specifics.  But I think he made a commitment to the American people.  And one of the things that I think the President continues to get high marks on is that regardless of whether you voted for him or not, or you agree with his policies, he’s a man of his word.  And he has followed up on the promises that he made to the American people.  And I think that's important.\nNow, again, I think that we will continue to work with Congress.  But the President understands that we have commitments that we've made on the entitlement side, in particular, and especially on the senior side with respect to Social Security that need to be maintained.  And so he’s going to keep this word to the American people.\nQ    But if you talk to some economic analysts, they say Social Security, Medicare won’t be there in a number of years if we don't address the fundamental problems.\nMR. SPICER:  And I think that -- right.  And so for right now, I think the budget that we're laying out deals on the discretionary side.  You've heard the President’s priorities and commitment, especially when it comes to protecting this country.  And if we have anything further, I’ll let you know.\nQ    And one more -- Sean, one more.  Is there an internal leak inquiry right now?\nMR. SPICER:  Not that I’m aware of.\nQ    Thank you very much, Sean.  I have two questions on U.S.-China relationship, if I may.\nMR. SPICER:  You may.\nQ    Thank you.\nMR. SPICER:  Everyone else gets two.\nQ    First of all, since President Trump took office, China sends it very first senior official, State Counselor Yang Jiechi, to visit Washington, D.C. today.  Will there will be a meeting with in the White House, and what’s the White House’s expectation of his visit?\nMR. SPICER:  So the State Counselor, and for those of you not schooled in the Chinese government, is basically the equivalent of our NSA Director -- NSC Director, correct?\nQ    Yes.\nMR. SPICER:  So the Ambassador and the State Counselor came today.  They had a meeting with H.R. McMaster, Jared Kushner, and I think some others sat in on the meeting.  They had a delegation of six people here.  After the meeting ended, I believe the State Counselor was taken and had an opportunity to say hi to the President before he left.  This is an opportunity to begin that conversation and talk to them on shared interests of national security.\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Sorry, hold on.  He gets one more.  Everybody else did.\nQ    Can I have a follow up?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me just -- everybody else got two.\nQ    Yes, just this morning, President Trump mentioned about his pick for ambassador to China, Governor --\nMR. SPICER:  Branstad.\nQ    Branstad.  Governor Branstad apparently has a really positive view on China.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    So how confident the President is on the Governor’s confirmation to get all the support in the Senate?\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, I think he’ll receive tremendous support -- bipartisan support.  Governor Branstad has been -- is a true -- he has huge ties on both sides.  I think he’s one of the longest serving governors ever, definitely in Iowa.  And I think that he has tremendous respect from both sides of the aisle not just for how he’s handled himself as a governor in Iowa, but his deep understanding and ties to China and to China’s economy and to Chinese officials.  And I think he’s going to do a phenomenal job representing our nation.\nHe starts with a deep understanding of the Chinese economy, the Chinese government, and that is going to really serve our nation well.\nMara.\nQ    Can I just have a follow-up on China?  Thank you.  Because I know I got one before.\nMR. SPICER:  You did.\nQ    I appreciate that.  A lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they felt -- they agreed with him that the U.S. was getting ripped off by China.  And after the election, he made the call to Taiwan, which he was praised for.  Then he told Fox News -- he said, \"I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\"  Then he reaffirmed the one-China policy.  So what did he get in return from China for doing that?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, he had a conversation with President Xi.  I’m not going to get into the details of it.  But at the President’s -- President Xi’s request and after a discussion, the President reaffirmed the one-China policy.  The President is not one to discuss his negotiating tactics.  So I --\nQ    But did he get something?  Can he assure the American people he got something?\nMR. SPICER:  The President always gets something.  Ryan.\nQ    Well, what was it?  What was it?\nQ    Sean, two quick follow-ups.  First of all, I noticed earlier today there were a lot of Republican governors out here but not very many Democratic governors.  Is this administration actively attempting to reach out to the other side of the aisle for compromise?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.  I think if you saw the remarks during this pool opportunity, the President talked about some of the conversations he had with Governor McAuliffe in Virginia in particular.  But they were here last night, they had dinner with their wives and husbands.  It was an opportunity to really talk to the Cabinet and get to know each other and talk about priorities.\nI will say that -- it’s interesting, I mentioned Obamacare.  When one of the things that was brought up by the governors -- and I’ve got to be honest, I wasn’t picking which governors and thinking of party -- but it came up over and over again that they actually -- several of them commented on how appreciative they have been in terms of seeking their input on not just healthcare but infrastructure and Medicaid, in particular, and other areas that fall into their thing -- to their wheelhouse.\nSo I think -- just so we’re clear, the dialogue that exists between this administration and this President and governors I think is a very refreshing move forward.\nQ    And then my point -- a follow-up, a quick follow-up.  I want to clarify a little bit of something that happened Thursday and Friday about the “public enemy” statement.  Are you saying that all of the press is the public enemy?  People who didn’t vote for the President?  Just the people in this room, or -- is it just Bill Maher and maybe Warren Beatty?  Can you clarify what we’re talking about?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President made clear in his tweet that he was referring to the fake news and people who ascribe to pushing fake stories is where his target was.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  As you know, more than 60 Democrats either boycotted or skipped the President’s inauguration.  What kind of reception do you think the President will get tomorrow evening from Democrats in the House and Senate when he gives his joint address?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I hope a very robust and applause-filled reception.  The speech, as I mentioned, breaks down a lot of barriers that have traditionally been political barriers in terms of areas where I think we should find agreement that reaffirm the President’s desire to unite the country and unite our parties in areas of shared common ground.\nAnd I think the things that he’s talking about -- increasing the support to our military, our veterans; helping children get an education -- those are things that hopefully we can all come together and think are shared American values, regardless of party.  I hope that we see a tremendous amount of support for the President and his policies and his vision tomorrow night.  He recognizes the problems that our nation faces, but he also charts a vision forward.  And I think it’s one that if people are honest, that they will agree that it really isn’t a political agenda as much as an agenda for this country and one to move us forward.\nSo I think that we’ll have to wait and see, but I can tell you that I think it will be a positive move forward.\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Couple follow-ups to Olivier’s question earlier about the ISIS review.  It’s day 30.  The memorandum the President signed 30 days ago said that he was supposed to be briefed.  Can you give us a more -- a timeline on when specifically President Trump will be involved -- I know you mentioned there’s a principals meeting earlier today -- what the timeline of the review is?  And then separately, you mentioned that Secretary Mattis was the one who’s presenting it to the principals committee.  The memorandum included things other than just the military; it included public diplomacy efforts to cut off financial ties to ISIS.  What were the other Cabinet secretaries involved?  What is sort of -- what got us here and where do we go from here?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Let me, if I may, get briefed on who and what occurred in the principals meeting to the extent that it’s available, and I’d be glad to get back to you tomorrow on that.  I just don’t have that information available.\nGabi.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Palm Beach County has said that it’s costing $60,000 a day in overtime pay every time the President comes to visit West Palm Beach.  He’s slated to go there again this weekend according to some reports.  Is the President taking any steps to ensure that taxpayers aren’t saddled with tremendous costs in his travel habits, considering he was so critical of his predecessor on that matter?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, Gabi, the security for the President and the First Family is set by the Secret Service.  As you know, they determine the security measures that need to be taken to protect the President -- frankly, any President.  So I’m going to leave it up to the Secret Service to decide what security measures and steps are taken to protect the President.\nAnd, as you know, I mean, this -- depending on -- it transcends administrations.  Wherever the President goes, they need to make sure that the President and the First Family is safe.  That’s something that I think -- we rely on the Secret Service to make those determinations.  They continue to do a phenomenal job making sure that the First Family and the President and the Vice President are protected, and we have full confidence in the decisions that they make.\nSo thank you guys very much.  We’ll have a briefing tomorrow -- later today on the state.\nQ    Approximate time?\nMR. SPICER:  What’s that?\nQ    Approximate time?\nMR. SPICER:  I would look in the 6 o'clock hour.\nQ    Here?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes, here.\nQ    After 6:00?\nMR. SPICER:  I get to see you here again.  I would plan on around 6:00.  We’ll have further guidance.  And I don’t anticipate it being long.  I think we’re just going to walk through the -- off camera.  We’ll walk through the themes of the speech, take any questions, and then try to get some additional information, depending on where the President is in his read-through.\nQ    No briefing tomorrow, right?\nMR. SPICER:  No briefing tomorrow.  If you don’t want one, you don’t have to have one.\nQ    You said you’d get back to us on a couple of issues tomorrow.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I’m -- it’s April that brought up no briefing.  If you guys want to vote --\nQ    No, no, no, but tradition is there’s no briefing on -- that’s why I’m asking.\nMR. SPICER:  I know.  We will do something for you, I promise.  We will make sure we get back --\nQ    Is it going to be a gaggle like last Friday, or is it going to be --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, we will get back to you.  I’m sure you’ll see my face here tomorrow.  Thank you very much.  I’ll see you guys tomorrow.\nEND\n2:46 P.M.

EST\nMR. SPICER:  Hey, guys.  You saw the President signed an executive order today, another important step towards eliminating job-crushing regulations and keeping the government agencies accountable by getting America back to work, just as he promised to do.  This afternoon, he's meeting with Governor Kasich.  The President of Peru, as I mentioned yesterday, will be swinging by.  Over the weekend, the President is going to be continuing to work on his joint address.  He's hosting a dinner in the State Dining Room of our nation's governors.  And the First Lady has a bunch of activities planned.  There's a ball Sunday night that the First Lady is hosting for the governors and their spouses.\nAnd as I mentioned yesterday -- and I think that's kind of it.  So with that, let me --\nQ    What is he going to talk to Kasich about?\nMR. SPICER:  This is something that they wanted to get together after the election and catch up, and discuss sort of the issues and agenda that the President is implementing, and hopefully how some of these things -- I think coal will probably come up.  But we'll try and see if we can get a readout of that afterwards.  We generally don’t provide readouts of that, but let me see what I can do.\nQ    Will the RNC come up?\nMR. SPICER:  Will the RNC?  What about the RNC?\nQ    About the convention that he didn’t attend.\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, I don’t know.  I doubt it.  My guess is that we're talking about things going forward.  It's obviously not for me to decide what the President discusses or what Governor Kasich decides to talk about.\nQ    Hey, Sean, just housekeeping-wise, can you just say why you decided to do this today off camera?  And then can you talk about some of the information that has come out from senior administration officials this morning regarding some of the pushback on The New York Times reporting that was on background?\nMR. SPICER:  I literally have said since day one that we would have some sort of gathering every day.  The President spoke today.  As you know, we don’t generally do -- we haven’t done briefings when the President has had a major event or an event with a world leader.  And we put it on the schedule yesterday that we were just going to gaggle.  I don’t -- I mean, this is something that we've talked about with the Correspondents' Association about making sure that we had daily contact with you guys.\nAnd I think -- obviously the President gave a very powerful speech today, and our job is to make sure that we're responsive to folks in the media.  We're here all day.  We've got a big staff.  And we want to make sure we answer your questions.  We don’t need to do everything on camera every day.  I think the President did a good job of making sure that -- today at CPAC, on camera, for a long time.  And I wanted to make sure that the President's message carried.\nOh, and then with respect to --\nQ    Can you talk about -- exactly, the pushback from this morning?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think -- we gathered with a small group this morning.  And I think part of this is to make sure that, especially in the case of CNN in particular, it was -- you were -- I think several media outlets, who, a majority, frankly, carried it very responsibly in terms of how the events unfolded.  But it's a pretty serious accusation.  And when you see the chyrons on CNN and the headlines and their story making it appear as though we did something wrong or nefarious, we wanted to make sure that we set the record straight.\nAnd I think that this morning was an opportunity to push back on what actually happened and why it happened.  And I think with respect to the events, just to be clear -- and I know we've gone over some of it -- that the deputy director of the FBI was at the White House for a 7:30 meeting, or whenever it was, the morning that the story came out.  He asked to see the chief of staff after the meeting privately, and said, in very colorful terms, that The New York Times story was not accurate.  As would anyone, frankly, at the time say, \"Could you clarify that then?  If it's not true, could you clarify the story?\"  The deputy director said, \"I'll get back to you.\"  When he got back to us, he said, hey, look, we don’t want to get in the practice of starting to refute every story.  The chief of staff said, well, you've put us in a very difficult situation; you've told us that a story that made some fairly significant accusations was not true.  And now you want us to just go out there -- and I think that we have a right, if there's information, or if you're saying the story is not right, could you at least make it available to the media or some folks in the media that, yes, that story is not right?  It made very, very serious allegations.\nAnd further in the day, the director of the FBI said to Reince that you have every right to go out there and say that you've been briefed by us, which he did.\nQ    So a clarification on that.  And on \"Meet the Press,\" when the chief of staff obviously said that he had had permission from senior intelligence officials, he was speaking about McCabe, the deputy director?\nMR. SPICER:  And the director.\nQ    So they had given him explicit permission?\nMR. SPICER:  They said, literally the story in The New York Times is not accurate.\nQ    Sean, do you have any idea what --\nQ    Sorry, I just want to follow up on this thread.  The President said today that he doesn’t like the idea of unnamed sources.  Obviously, this administration briefs on background, meaning on the condition that you not be named.  Is that going to change now?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, but I'll give you a great example.  This morning -- there's a big difference --\nQ    But --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, Hallie, let me answer the question.\nQ    I didn’t get to the question.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, go ahead.\nQ    Is there -- go ahead, you first.\nMR. SPICER:  No, I didn’t let you get to your question, so go ahead.  Seriously, keep going.\nQ    The question was, do you plan to change that?  Are you going to do all your briefings on the record?\nMR. SPICER:  So there is, I think, a big difference -- this morning was an example where we wanted to have a free-flowing exchange with reporters.  At the end of the conversation, several reporters said, can we use some of this on the record?  We said yes.  So the answer is, is that there is times when --\nQ    But it's --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, Hallie.  Let me just answer.\nQ    All right, I'm just flowing.\nMR. SPICER:  I think there is an opportunity -- there's a way to use background sourcing to be able to have a much more robust discussion about some things.  We came back, as the example this morning, and said, sure, there are quotes that you can use on the record.  I think there's a big difference between explaining a policy and wanting to be able to have that kind of discussion where you say, hey, let's do this on background.  And I think, generally speaking, we've been pretty open to saying, sure, we'll put those statements on -- or if you want to clear some stuff on the record, for the most part we've been very good about it.\nThere's a big difference between making serious allegations -- us coming back on the record, and reporters saying, well, we have five sources that are unnamed that say contrary to that.  I think there's a point at which there's an obligation, if you're going to make a very serious allegation, and we're willing to push back on the record that there be somebody at the very least that's willing to push back on this and say that they'll put their name attached to it.  When you look at the reporting that The New York Times initially did, it was all background sources.  It basically accused the President and his campaign team of doing some very, very serious stuff.  We pushed back against that reporting at the time, and we were met with, \"Well, we have unnamed sources.\"  And I think there's an obligation at some when, if you're going to make allegations of a serious nature, to at least make somebody go on the record and say, yes, I'm willing to stand behind that, when we're willing to or another organization is willing to refute them on the record.\nSo we often get met with us going on the record in multiple ways with reporters to only be told, \"Well, we're not going to believe you on the record because we've got one, two, three unnamed sources that we're not going to tell you who they are, where they're from, whether or not they're even in the circle of orbit.\"  And in many cases, when I push against reporters, I'll say, look, there were four people in that meeting -- here are the four people.  Can you confirm any of them?  \"Well, no they were people who heard from them.\"  So I've literally gone back to people and said, there is a room that occurred with four, five, six people in it, and this didn’t happen because I was in the room.  And they'll say, yeah, but people who were briefed by those people.  So how many degrees of telephone do you play before at least you're willing to say, if someone in the room won't at least put their name on it or you won't admit that somebody in the room is willing to say it?  I think that that undermines the credibility of some of the reporting that's going on.\nQ    Can you explain the distinction that the administration has drawn between a lot of conservative anger about the Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton conversation versus the obviously Reince Priebus-Deputy Director conversation?  The administration has said it’s different because the Chief of Staff was talking about a report, a news report and not an investigation.  But the report was about an investigation.  So does the administration worry that the Chief of Staff has crossed the line?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no, hold on, hold on.  And I brought this up this morning -- sorry for those of you who have to listen to this twice -- let’s reverse-engineer this in two ways.  Number one, the deputy director comes to us.  We didn't go to them.  The differences in the case --\nQ    I'm not going to rehash, but I want to get this --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, I am.  But I --\nQ    I think it’s important to get on the record.\nMR. SPICER:  And I will.  And, by the way, just as a side note, as I mentioned to one of your colleagues today, doing a gaggle doesn't preclude us from doing something on camera later today.  And I’m more than welcome -- I think the idea was that with time being what it is today, we wanted to just make sure that you guys got up-to-dated on a variety of issues.\nBut there’s nothing that precludes us from saying, hey, we’ll go do an on-camera interview.  So just the idea that we don't do something in the Briefing Room doesn't preclude.  Here's the thing -- there’s a big difference.  The deputy director came to the chief of staff of the White House and literally said, the story is false.\nSo here are the two scenarios.  One is, the chief of staff says nothing and just stares at him, which is what some of the folks in this room believe he should have done, he should have just sat there and said -- (indicating) -- which, now if any of you -- the second piece of this is that nine times out of ten0, when I deal with you guys, and I’ll say we had a big problem with the story in X publication or X outlet, the first question I get asked is:  Well, did you push back?  Did you ask for a correction?\nAnd I think in this case, the point is, is that all we simply did was say, wow, you're bringing us information saying that something -- a story in The New York Times is not accurate.  So is there something that you're doing to let other journalists know that it’s not true?  Because they're asking us.\nSo that morning I got, let’s say, five, ten, fifteen phone calls from you and your colleagues, saying, \"Hey, there’s a report in The New York Times -- what do you think about it?\"  Well, if someone is coming to us telling us that it’s not a true story, our goal was to literally just say to them, will your public affairs office take this phone call?\nQ    Sean, is there an expectation --\nMR. SPICER:  I just want to be clear.  I really am intrigued by I don't know what else we were supposed to do.  We were provided information.  And this notion that I see on CNN about we pushed back or we applied pressure.  Pressure, by definition, is applying force.  So if we had said, \"If you don't do this, if you don't do that,\" that's pressure.  And I get that.  That would have been wrong.  \"We order you to do this.  We require you to do that.  We're urging\" -- we literally responded when presented with information and said, \"Could you let the media know that, what you're informing us of?\"\nAnd the answer was, well, we don't want to get in the middle of starting a practice of doing this.  So our answer is, well, why did you come to us with this information if not to elicit a response?\nI don't know what else you do except for say, gosh, could you clear the record up?  That is a very different scenario than trying to exert influence on a situation.  We literally responded to what they came to us with and said, okay, what are you going to do about it?\nAnd again, if you take --\nQ    Did you --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, I’ll finish with this, because the thing that's interesting to me is that had we not done anything and just sat there, what would -- it would have been irresponsible and, frankly, malpractice to say, yes, I was informed that we didn't do anything, and yet I didn't act.\nQ    So we talked about this six hours ago, all that same stuff.  Can we just move ahead a little bit here?  Do you have any idea what McCabe’s motivation was in coming forward?\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    Because then he asked the Chief of Staff to call him back at the FBI, only to then be told from the FBI Headquarters, there’s nothing we can do.  And then it was a very small circle of people who knew about this, and yet it leaked.\nMR. SPICER:  I think that's concerning.  Again, remember the timetable.  We didn't ask them for that meeting.  Reince had never met the guy prior to that morning.  He wouldn’t have known who he was.  And frankly -- so he showed up at a meeting.  Director Comey was traveling that day.  It was an intel meeting on a separate subject.  So the idea that -- and again, they don't dispute -- from what I understand -- any of this chronology that he pulled him aside.  So if you logically can ask yourself why would he have pulled him aside to update him on a story just to say, \"Hey, I know we've never met before, but I just wanted to know if you read the paper today\"?  Logically that makes zero sense.\nSo I don't know what his motivations were.  I don't -- I think hopefully to make sure that they knew that they were informing up what the status of the story was.\nAnd can I make one more claim?  Because this just dovetails into something that Hallie asked.  Just so we're clear -- because I’ve seen a lot of reporting about was it proper or whatever -- first of all, there’s nothing -- there is literally a memo out from past Attorneys General about how the DOJ will deal with the White House.  There is literally a carve-out for dealing with public affairs.  This is a story in The New York Times that was not accurate, according to them.  So this idea about how we handled it, or how they handled it, there is literally in the memo -- which is all it is, it’s a guidance memo -- there’s literally a carve-out that specifically addresses how to handle public affairs.\nQ    Let me just come back to the leak.  Because you've got three people who were in this loop.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    You've got the chief of staff of the White House.  You've got the deputy director and the director of the FBI.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    And yet this somehow leaks.\nMR. SPICER:  I think that's why the President --\nQ    If the President is pursuing leaks, it would seem that he doesn't have to look too far.\nMR. SPICER:  And that's why I think you've seen the President’s tweet on this today, and you've heard the President’s comments.  He is not just today, but last week at the press conference.  This is troubling when an FBI or anyone in the intelligence world, or, frankly, anyone in government entrusted with classified information and national security information is sharing that information widely.  Yeah, that's a big problem.  And I think you've seen the President’s concern for this issue.\nQ    Should he fire somebody?  Is he going to fire Director Comey?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not going to -- I think I will leave it at the President’s tweet speaks for itself, and the President’s comments on his concern for national security -- yes, it’s concerning.  Overall -- overall, it’s concerning.\nCharlie.\nQ    Pulling back, this Russia narrative continues to dog the administration and it’s something that Americans have been paying attention to, it's something the media has been paying attention to.  How do you -- what’s your goal to sort of end this narrative?  Is there any way you could answer more questions, do more things to finish this thing that started right after the election, that somehow the President has an improper relationship with Russia?  Is he prepared to answer some of these questions, release some more details to finally put an end to this?  Or are we just going to continue to find out about his connections through these leaks?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, there are no connections to find out about.  That's the problem.  I think, A, he’s answered it forcefully.  You can't disprove something that doesn't exist.  He’s talked about the fact how many times he’s talked to Putin.  He has no interests in Russia.  He has no -- there’s only so many times he can deny something that doesn't exist.\nQ    Until another leak comes out?\nMR. SPICER:  But what are the leaks?  The leaks don't actually -- again, you've got a story that comes out from The New York Times with unnamed sources.  You have the FBI coming to us.  And frankly -- and I don't -- I know that I do a really good job of lecturing you guys, so I’ll try to stay silent on a Friday.  But to some degree the true story -- and Chairman Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee is on the record saying that he received a report and corroborates it.  At some point, isn’t the story that actually the accusations that came out have been disputed?\nQ    I guess the question is --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  The House Intelligence Committee came out, after getting the briefing, and said that the story is demonstrably false.  And I don’t mean to put words into the chairman’s mouth there.  I think he’s quoted in the Wall Street Journal.  But, at some point, isn’t the story actually that there is no story, to your point; that it’s been disproven, and it’s not the level to which The New York Times has made it to be?\nBut all we have done from the get-go is exactly what you’re asking, which is to continue to disprove a negative.\nQ    Sean, on that -- but continuing with that though, are you then saying that you would encourage, not interfere with, and not in any way encourage the Attorney General to suppress the investigation?  Because there is some suggestion of that.  Putting this story aside, there is a suggestion that there is suppression.\nMR. SPICER:  I know, but the only suggestion, Margaret, with all due respect, is from you guys.  There was -- we were not aware of --\nQ    Actually, it’s not.  There --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no -- but who?  So you have someone like Nancy Pelosi coming out and making a wildly inappropriate statement.\nQ    I'm speaking specifically to the Department of Justice, not Capitol Hill.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  But in other words, we’re not aware of an investigation, so how would we be able to -- well, I’m sorry, what was the word that you used?\nQ    Suppression.\nMR. SPICER:  But, but -- so if you’re going to make an accusation like that, where is the evidence that there has been anything that A, exists, or B, that we’ve suppressed anything?\nQ    But the question was, are you actually saying any investigation -- if there was any reason to investigate, the Department of Justice should go ahead, because there is a --\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    -- suggestion at the Department of Justice, on the --\nMR. SPICER:  Sure, if there is evidence of anything --\nQ    -- that there is --\nMR. SPICER:  No, that’s their job.  Look --\nQ    -- (inaudible) question.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And I think we’ve made it clear that if there’s evidence of something, pursue it.  And we’ve said that very clearly about the House and Senate.  There is nothing to -- we have nothing to hide.  The President has been crystal-clear consistently over and over again.  And my point to you is that at some point you use words like \"suppression\" or \"investigation\" -- then show us.  Where's this investigation?  Where is the suppression that's occurring?  Where's the so-called pushback or pressure?\nI mean, respectfully, guys, I don’t -- I find a lot of this offensive.  When you talk about us pushing back on something that doesn’t exist, at some point answer the opposite -- which is, what were we supposed to do when presented by information by them?  Sit back and do nothing?\nQ    I'm not speaking about that point and case.  I'm talking about at the Department of Justice, writ large, investigating ties to Russia.  Is that an investigation that should continue to proceed?\nMR. SPICER:  If they have an investigation, then they should do what they want.  They should follow the law.\nQ    And is that the message that the President has delivered to the Attorney General?\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, he literally swore him in.  I think something like, I hope you execute the -- I mean, why would he have to -- again, respectfully, it's insulting that the President would have to tell the Attorney General to follow the law.  Did you ask the same question about Obama with respect to Holder?  I mean, with all of the stuff that went out there, did you --\nQ    There are reports and those are lines of questions that --\nMR. SPICER:  Did you ever ask that question?\nQ    I wasn’t covering that case, but there were reporters at my network who did.\nMR. SPICER:  They did?  So they did.  You can --\nQ    I believe it was CBS that broke the \"Fast and Furious\" story.  But anyway, moving --\nMR. SPICER:  That's not what I asked.  No, no, I didn’t ask that question.  I'm saying, did you ever question the White House, or did CBS, on the record, question the Obama administration whether or not they asked the Attorney General to follow the law?\nQ    But there is -- Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  No, see what you just did?  You told ---\nQ    I'm trying to answer you.  There is a sort of boilerplate speaking point, talking point to say we don’t want to impede an ongoing investigation, we hope that all those thing --\nMR. SPICER:  Did you ever ask the Obama administration the same question?\nQ    About this?  No.\nMR. SPICER:  No, about whether or not they asked Attorney General Holder to follow the law.  These boilerplate language --\nQ    There were plenty of questions about interference --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, look --\nQ    Yes, there were plenty of questions about interference.\nMR. SPICER:  So you can you tell me that CBS asked the White House that same question?\nQ    About whether the Justice Department was interfering in investigations?\nMR. SPICER:  Would follow the law, would use this \"boilerplate language\"?\nQ    Yes.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.\nQ    But to the point, there are people that --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no, but you don’t get to pivot, Margaret.\nQ    I'm not.  I'm actually asking to stay on the topic, which was the topic of the Russia investigation, not what you're talking about.  So on the topic of the Russia investigation, what you have said is there is no knowledge at the White House of any investigation into ties with Russia?\nMR. SPICER:  I am not aware of an investigation.  If there was one, then they should follow the law.  But I don’t think -- I will definitely try to look for whether or not CBS asked the same question to the White House during the eight years of the Obama administration.  Because at least I never saw that.\nQ    Sean, can you say why Mr. Priebus wanted -- when he talked to McCabe -- why did he then want the FBI to go do, on their own, bat this story down?  Was there something about it being more credible if the FBI were to speak up about than if it was just coming from --\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, so just stop for a second.  Let's walk through this logically.  I come to you and say, hey, there's evidence that whatever you've been accused of is not true.  What's your response?  No, no, answer the question.\nQ    You said to me that there's evidence of --\nMR. SPICER:  So you've been accused of some wrongdoing, and I come to you and say, hey, guess what -- the accusations that you've been accused of I know they aren’t true.\nQ    I'd love for you to tell everybody.  I'm asking specifically in this case.  I'm just asking in this case was there a sense, on this subject matter, which is politically very loaded, where you feel you haven’t been treated well, that it would be more useful for the administration if the FBI spoke up --\nMR. SPICER:  No, it's not a question of useful.  They came to us and said, this story is not true.  We said, great, could you tell people that?  Reporters are asking us, we've denied it.  We did deny it.  I'm really having a tough time understanding the logic of your question.  They story gets printed in The New York Times.  Just to be clear, let's think about this for a second.  If we knew that this story was false and we wanted the FBI to pressure, wouldn’t we have asked the day before when the story was coming out?\nQ    I wasn’t suggesting you asked them to pressure.  That was not the premise of the question.\nMR. SPICER:  So they come to us with information that morning and say, the story that was published is not accurate.  What should have been the White House's response?\nQ    I'm not going to say what your response should have been.  But do you see what I'm asking is --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I don’t.  I really don’t.  I think it's insane.  I think it really -- the idea that you're saying someone tells you that something is false --\nQ    Did you think that denial would be more credible if it came from the FBI instead of from you?\nMR. SPICER:  Of course, it would.  Because the story listed intelligence sources as saying -- The New York Times said, according to multiple sources in the intelligence community, this is false.  If the FBI and part of the intelligence community says, we believe it's false, it came out after we had denied it -- and, of course, The New York Times didn’t believe us, said, oh, we have X number of sources in the intel community, you're wrong -- why wouldn’t we want someone with credibility who's saying, we have no evidence that this story is accurate, come out and say that?\nQ    I guess what I'm aiming towards is, are you trying to -- do you guys feel like there's been background sources from the intelligence community saying things that you dispute, that you don’t like?  Is this part of a broader effort to get the intelligence community --\nMR. SPICER:  That's barely -- you show a lack of -- I mean --\nQ    To go on the record.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, hold on, hold on.  Just stop for a second.  They come to us and say, \"The New York Times is quoting intelligence sources claiming X, Y and Z.  We don’t believe that that's accurate.\"  \"Okay, could you please let people know that that's not true?\"\nQ    And I'm saying, when you say that, is that a way of asking them to get their house in order if these sources are talking --\nMR. SPICER:  No, it's a way of saying -- if someone witnesses something that happened and says, I'm willing to go out and say that, hey, I saw that actually the car went right and not left, and I can clear this up -- wouldn’t you want the witness to do that?  The FBI is saying, we are in the intelligence business, we didn’t think that story was accurate; we wanted you to know.  Our answer is, great, reporters are calling us -- could you let them know?\nQ    But I think that happens pretty regularly, that the FBI tells you something and they are not deciding what’s going to go into the public sphere or not.  That’s your job, right?\nMR. SPICER:  Not if -- we had to -- I mean, no, actually it doesn’t, to be honest with you.  It’s the first time that I’ve seen it happen.  Obviously, we had never had -- the chairman had never -- the chief of staff had never met this guy before.  So for him to come over and say, hey, by the way -- no, that doesn’t -- at least in my 30-some-odd days, it’s never happened.\nQ    I guess what I was wondering is why it’s so unusual for them to want the White House, the political component, to be the ones deciding about what gets put --\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know, ask them.  Again, I hate to probably break some norm, but maybe you should direct your question to them.  I know that’s probably -- now you’re going to have stories about how I directed reporters to call the public affairs office to do --\nQ    But I'm asking you the question.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, because -- I know, and I’ve asked and answered it, like, 18 times.\nQ    Sean, did Reince talk to counsel, the White House Counsel’s Office after he talked to McCabe?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t -- it’s possible.  It’s very possible that they were in the initial meeting.  I’m sure that he has followed up with counsel and said, hey, I just was told this -- at some point.\nQ    This is a bit of a difficult situation and what do we do.\nMR. SPICER:  But again, at the beginning part, the answer was to tell -- to say to McCabe, hey, let us know how you want to handle this.\nQ    So that secondary --\nMR. SPICER:  Just remember the response, which is, it wasn’t a directive.  We didn’t say, \"Go do the following.\"  That’s a directive.  That could be -- we literally said, \"What can you do to help get the world out?  Could you take calls from reporters?  Will you clear this up?\"\nQ    But that kind of, \"what could you do\" wasn’t -- to your knowledge it wasn’t after he had spoken to counsel and said --\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, no, it was immediate.\nQ    Okay.\nMR. SPICER:  Like, \"Hey, what can you do?\"  And the answer that McCabe gave was, \"Give me a few hours to get back to you and see what we can do.\"\nQ    So you know what McCabe went away and did in those two hours?  I mean, was he talking to his own counsel?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know.  You should ask him.  I don’t want to --\nQ    Okay.\nQ    Sean, going forward, then, with the FBI, you have a fundamental persistent dispute with them about them stepping into such matters and --\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t -- in terms of what, Dave?\nQ    In terms of if this situation arises again where they have information that they could back down an untrue story --\nMR. SPICER:  I think that the FBI -- sure.  I mean, if the FBI knows something to be false, unless it hinders intelligence-gathering, an ongoing investigation, I don’t want to get in the -- I mean, our job isn’t to get in the way of them doing their job, i.e. investigating something or uncovering a plot, or whatever they’re doing.  If there’s some reason that they have to act in accordance to protect this country, they should by all means do it.  But to come to somebody and say, you’ve been accused of some pretty serious things and we know them not to be accurate, I would assume that you would want -- I mean, isn’t their job justice?\nI mean, that’s -- I mean, if you wrote a story that was knowingly false and somebody came to you and said, I know, Dave, that the story you wrote is false and I’ve got some facts to prove it, I would hope and I do believe that you would say, get them to me and I’m going to update the story.\nIf this was you, and you had written a story and someone from the FBI came to you and said, hey, I know you wrote that story, Dave, or, Hallie, I saw your package last night, and, gosh, we’re in the intel community and I’m willing to let you know it’s not accurate -- I would assume that your answer would be, okay, what do I need to do to correct it, or what can I do, or what can you give me.\nQ    So the administration still maintains there is no investigation.\nMR. SPICER:  No, that’s not what I said, Charlie.  No.  I literally said then when presented with a story that we were told was not accurate, our answer was, could you go tell other people that it’s not accurate or correct it, or whatever you see fit.  But what are we doing to get the story or the facts straight?\nQ    So you don’t know whether or not there is an investigation.\nMR. SPICER:  I know nothing more than they told us a story was not accurate.  And our answer was, what are you going to do to get the story right.  It wasn’t -- that’s it, full stop.  There was no discussion about anything beyond the story.  And the story wasn’t right.  And I believe he used --\nQ    So you’re not aware of any investigation into Russia, did I misunderstand that?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not aware of one.  Huh?  You asked me if I was aware.  I am not.\nQ    Is the administration?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t -- that’s a pretty broad term.  I’m not aware of one.  And so --\nQ    More broadly then, to this point, is there concern -- or what does this say about the relationship between the administration and the FBI, given that you used words like “concerned,” “troubling,” talking about leaks?  Should Americans be concerned about fallout between the White House and the FBI?\nMR. SPICER:  I think you should -- no, I mean, all I know is they’ve told us some information, we’ve asked them to help get the word out.  That’s where it stands.\nQ    But you called the potential leaks “troubling” and “concerning.”\nMR. SPICER:  No, I was asked about the leaks, Hallie.\nQ    But you directed us back to the President’s tweet, which says, “The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security 'leakers'.”  Are we to deduce that the President has lost confidence in the FBI and the Director?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that I’m going to let the President’s tweet stand for itself.  But I think that -- and again, I think he commented on this last week, that there is a concern -- these are two separate issues.  One is the instance at hand and the story that came out, and the second is the leaks that are coming out.\nQ    And on a sort of semi-related note, this banner on CNN right now that says \"CNN and others have been blocked from media briefings,\" are CNN and The New York Times not in here right now because you’re unhappy with their reporting?  And why are they not in here?\nMR. SPICER:  Because we had a pool and then we expanded it, and we added some folks to come and cover it.\nQ    But there’s enough room for others in here.\nMR. SPICER:  It was my decision to decide -- you know, to expand the pool.  Yeah.\nQ    Sean, the President said today at CPAC, “We’re going to do something about it” in reference to these stories that he is saying are false by The New York Times and CNN and others.  What is he talking about there?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry, say the beginning.\nQ    He said, “We are going to do something about it” when he was referencing --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I mean, I think we’re going to aggressively push back.  We’re just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there.\nQ    In terms of leaks, what’s the next step?  The President has been concerned --\nMR. SPICER:  The President is not going to tell you how he’s going to handle this.  Obviously, that would undermine the ability to block them if people knew what he was going to do or how he was going to handle it.\nQ    Can I first ask about the shooting in Kansas of the two Indian Americans and what the President’s response to it was, but also if there’s any concern that some of the rhetoric that the President or -- that generally has been out here recently could have contributed in any way to that or stepped up violence?\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, obviously, any loss of life is tragic, but I’m not going to get into, like, that kind of -- to suggest that there’s any correlation I think is a bit absurd.  So I’m not going to go any further than that.\nQ    Can I ask about the CEA?  Politico is saying that Kevin Hassett is the President’s choice.  I’m wondering if you can confirm that.\nMR. SPICER:  I can't.\nQ    And then more broadly, the CEA is not among the President’s Cabinet positions anymore and I’m wondering if you can explain --\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t think it was during Bush, was it?\nQ    I know it was under Obama.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, so what’s -- okay.  Some positions are and some positions aren’t.  I mean, there are --\nQ    Well, can you just explain the logic behind --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I can’t.  I mean, I think the President makes a decision -- he can always expand his Cabinet.  But I think that there’s some Cabinet positions that each administration decides are part of their Cabinet, some aren’t.  And I think the President has an unbelievably talented group of economic advisors, from Steve Mnuchin to Wilbur Ross to Robert Lighthizer, should he be confirmed by the Senate, as well as Wilbur and others.\nSo it’s every President’s prerogative to decide beyond the statutory members of the Cabinet who else to have included.\nQ    Can I follow up on the shooting?  You mentioned that -- is it the -- what part is the “absurd”?  I guess I’m just --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, it’s absurd to suggest that rhetoric.  And I think the point that was at least -- I think the --\nQ    I mean, the comment from the man supposedly is, “Get out of my country.”  Is it a question of it’s too early to call it a hate crime?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no, but I think they’re pointing out -- at least what I thought was being asked is, is there any, like -- was it your intention to suggest that there was, like, a connection between --\nQ    I mean, I think that -- I didn't want to say, this person did -- I mean, I don't think any of us could know that possibly.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think to sort of -- to right now intimate what the motives are is too early.  I mean, I guess my point is to sort of jump to a conclusion.  We've seen that too often in the past -- in Florida and other places where people jump to a conclusion.  This is -- we're not going to be subject to calling a video as the Clinton -- as the Obama administration did.  I mean, let's let law enforcement do its job before we start jumping to conclusions.\nQ    Do you know of any other parts of the administration looking into this potentially?  The Department of Justice, for example, maybe?\nMR. SPICER:  I don't have anything for you on this.\nQ    So today, President Trump talked about how he's going to build up the military, there's going to be a big funding request.  Can you talk about how much money does the President think he's going to need to ask for?  And how is this going to be paid for?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's two things.  One, I think he'll touch on this in the joint address.  But, secondly, the budget that's come out will be very clear about where a lot of that funding will come from.  And so I don't want to get ahead of either of those, but I will -- I think they're good questions that will be answered in due time, both beginning with the joint address -- we'll touch on that.  And, second, from a more detailed standpoint, the budget, specifically with respect to the savings and how savings and how additional funding would be processed.\nQ    And regarding the joint address, do you imagine the joint address will be kind of like this very broad, like overhead look at what the President plans to do?  Or will it be very specific, like bullet points, this is what we're going to do, very specific policies that we're going to enact?\nMR. SPICER:  I think it will be a little bit of a blend.  More so the former than the latter.  I think he's going to talk very optimistically about where we're going to go as a country and the general policies that he's going to pursue to get us there.  I don't think this is going to be the same old Christmas tree kind of State of the Union.  And I think there is a little bit of a traditional tweak between a joint address and a State of the Union.\nQ    Is the President going to meet with insurers on Monday?\nMR. SPICER:  I'll have Lindsay get out -- we're going to get the schedule together.  I think --\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, I told Gabi, and then I've got to be downstairs.\nQ    Okay, I have a question on the budget.  With so few Cabinet Secretaries confirmed right now, is the White House working with agencies to ensure that their submissions are being --\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    Okay, and do you expect the budget to be thin because of the absence of Cabinet Secretaries?\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    Okay.\nMR. SPICER:  I think -- I mean, it may be thin, but that's because of -- I'm joking.  I think the President's commitment to getting Washington in order is going to be very apparent in the budget, and his desire to respect taxpayers and duplicity in government and programs that are outdated is going to be very much reflected in the budget.\nBut we start that process sometime next week, where they start the passback process of going through departments and what their top lines are and things like that.\nQ    If I could just ask one more question on immigration.  Before the President was inaugurated, he said that approximately 2 million to 3 million criminal illegal aliens would be deported during his first year in office.  But according to the guidance that Secretary Kelly sent out earlier this week, they are now saying that law enforcement officials should be also looking at apprehending and deporting low-level criminal illegal immigrants and anybody that DHS deems a public risk.\nHow does the administration -- I mean, number one, can we expect that figure -- 2 million to 3 million -- to expand now that it seems the definition of criminal illegal aliens has expanded?  And also, how are you going to ensure that somebody who didn't just get a traffic ticket isn't included in that -- under that definition?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm not -- we're not going to ensure anything.  I mean, that's the job of ICE -- or DHS and then, more specifically, ICE, is to look at who is in this country, where they sit on that.  But it is not the job of the White House to get involved and do carve-outs about misdemeanor versus that.  People who I think -- I would actually just leave it at you should contact ICE in terms of how they're prioritizing this.\nOur job was to make sure that they were enforcing the laws and achieving the mission, protecting the nation, and I'll leave it at that.\nQ    Was that something that the White House had spoken with Secretary Kelly about?  About expanding the definition of the individuals it would include?\nMR. SPICER:  I would touch base with Secretary Kelly's office and then ICE.  But our job was to give them -- the executive order and the guidance they put out I think is pretty explicit as far as describing how that executive order is going to be carried out.  And then Secretary Kelly lays out very specifically how they're going to achieve that.  So if you look at the factsheet and the letters that he put out, I think it lays it out pretty well.\nQ    Is the President hoping to have this executive order on immigration done before the joint session to Congress?  And can you talk a little bit about -- you've talked about the delay in it is related to the fact that there's been more communication with other agencies to make sure this is rolled out appropriately.  Can you talk about what -- I mean, what is the President looking for to get from these agencies?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we're just trying to make sure that it is done precisely with a precision that he expects to make sure that we achieve the goal of the executive order when it's issued.\nQ    Sean, on healthcare, there's a new executive -- a new draft bill, a draft proposal that's been circulating on Capitol Hill that's now been made public that, for example, shrinks Medicaid expansion, scales back subsidies, et cetera.  Is this something the President would support?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm not going to get into what we are or are not going to support.  That's my understanding, from media reports, is that that's a House draft and I would respectfully ask that you follow up with them.\nQ    Real quick yes or no.  The President said at CPAC this morning that we're going to see the biggest buildup of the military in American history.  Can we take that to the bank?  Is that a real promise?  Or is that --\nMR. SPICER:  I think you can take what the President says to the bank.\nThank you, guys.  I've got to get downstairs.\nQ    One more question just about the idea that it seems as though you're playing favorites with media outlets by excluding some from this conversation.\nMR. SPICER:  You're my favorite.  (Laughter.)\nQ    No, that's not what I'm asking.  But do you have a response to that, though, given that that is a concern to some that want to see press have access to you, all out?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think that -- right -- I think that we have shown an abundance of accessibility.  We've brought more reporters into this process.  And the idea that every time that every single person can't get their question answered or fit in a room that we're excluding people -- we've actually gone above and beyond with making ourselves, our team and our briefing room, more accessible than probably any prior administration.  So I think you can take that to the bank.  When you look at --\nQ    But why not those other outlets today?\nMR. SPICER:  Because, Cecilia, there's 3,000 people that are credentialed to come in here.\nQ    But there are six outlets that want to be in here right now.  The New York Times --\nMR. SPICER:  No, there's not.  Actually, that is false.  To say that there are six -- maybe six that reached out to you, but that is not --\nQ    Well, but --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, hold on --\nQ    -- listed in the White House Correspondents' Association's response to this.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  There are way more than six that wanted to come in.  We started with the pool and then we expanded it.  So I get it.  But why -- I can ask -- there are plenty that want to come in at all times for every event.  We do what we can to be accessible.  And if there's a problem with that, I understand it.  But we do what we can to accommodate the press.  I think we've gone above and beyond when it comes to accessibility and openness and getting folks to -- our officials, our team.  And so, respectfully, I disagree with the premise of the question.\nThank you.\nEND\n2:18 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:58 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  I was thinking about not doing a briefing today, and then I saw Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon give that talk and I thought they were infringing on my ratings, so we figured we had to do something to keep up our record.\nIt’s been another busy day today.  This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President welcomed some of the world’s top business and manufacturing leaders to the White House to continue the administration’s effort to engage with the private sector to create jobs and expand opportunities for America’s workers.  The 24 CEOs spent the morning in working sessions with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides, and came together with the President to brief him on their discussions and recommendations.\nThe group discussed the need to roll back burdensome regulations that are stifling economic growth.  The CEOs thanked the President for the actions that he’s already taken to address the issues, and the President pledged to do even more, both through the executive branch and by working with Congress to pass legislation that will help further economic growth and job creation.\nThe business leaders recommended that the administration take a multifaceted approach to tax and trade policies, including tax reform, toward which Secretary Mnuchin said that progress is continuing to be made.  The President committed to working to lower taxes and level the playing field with other countries when it comes to trade and taxation.\nThe group held a lengthy discussion about the need to invest in the American worker to prepare for the manufacturing jobs of the future, especially the key role of vocational schools in training the workforce of the 21st century.  The CEOs and administration officials agreed that public-private partnerships will be the cornerstone of a robust plan to rebuild the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.  The President committed to streamlining a permitting process that is holding back so many key projects.\nAt the end of the discussion, the group expressed their excitement for having a true partner in economic growth in the White House, and Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical, even said that this is probably the most pro-business administration since the Founding Fathers.  The President conveyed his intention to assemble the industry leaders on a regular basis to discuss progress towards these important goals.  A full list of the participants is available.\nThis afternoon, the President spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau by phone.  We’ll have a readout on that call soon.  Right now, many of you just came from the President, who is involved in another listening session with leaders in the fight against domestic and international human trafficking, including representatives from International Justice Mission and United Way.  Their expertise will be invaluable to the President as he engages with members of Congress to raise awareness about, and push through, legislation aimed at preventing all forms of the horrific and unacceptable practice of the buying and selling of human lives.\nHuman trafficking is a dire problem, both domestically and internationally.  And solving this epidemic is a huge priority for the President.  Dedicated men and women from across the federal government have focused on this for some time, and the President is committed to continue working with these organizations and departments.  A participant list for this listening session is also going to be available.\nThe President this evening will attend a dinner with the Business Council.\nToday in Mexico, Secretaries Tillerson and Kelly had productive meetings at the Cabinet level with officials from the Mexican government.  They were forward-looking meetings focused on finding common-ground ways to advance both of our countries’ security and economic wellbeing.  Both sides had a candid discussion on the breadth of challenges and opportunities as part of the U.S.-Mexico relationship.\nThe conversation covered a full range of bilateral issues, including energy, legal migration, security, education exchanges, and people-to-people ties.  The parties also reiterated our joint commitment to maintaining law and order at our shared border by stopping potential terrorists and dismantling the transnational criminal networks that are moving drugs and people into the United States.\nUnder this President there is no mistaking that rule of law matters along both sides of our border.  Both Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are meeting with President Peña Nieto this afternoon.  That will be a continuation of the productive dialogue that is setting our two countries down a pathway to greater security and long-term prosperity.\nLooking ahead to our upcoming schedule, tomorrow the President will welcome President of Peru for a working-level visit.  The President of Peru is in town for a separate visit and requested a meeting with the President.  There will be a spray at the top of that.  Further guidance will be provided later today.  The President will also speak at CPAC tomorrow.  I know the President is looking forward to addressing this group of conservative-committed individuals.\nOur nation’s governors are starting to gather in Washington this week for a meeting of the National Governors Association.  The President and the First Lady will welcome the governors to the White House on Sunday evening.  The Vice President and members of the Cabinet will also be in attendance.  While the governors are in town, they will be meeting with members of the Cabinet, White House staff, and other Secretaries including Kelly, Price, and Secretary Chao have also set up a series of meetings.\nThe President, Vice President, and senior White House staff will also participate in a portion of the business session of NGA’s winter meeting that takes place on Monday morning.\nNext week, of course, the President will give a joint session address before both Houses of Congress.  He’s currently working closely with the speechwriting team on presenting his vision to Congress and the American people.  I’ve got a few updates that I want to just -- as we’re now a few days out.  The theme of the address will be the renewal of the American spirit.  The address will particularly focus on public safety, including defense, increased border security, taking care of our veterans, and then economic opportunity, including education, job training, healthcare reform, jobs, and tax and regulatory reform.\nWith that, I’d be glad to take a few of your questions.\nQ    Two questions.  First, the White House said previously that that travel ban was pushed quickly out of necessity for national security, and now we’re hearing there’s these repeated delays while the new one is being drafted.  How do we reconcile those two talking points?  That’s question one.\nAnd then secondly, the President said today that the deportations taking place under his watch are a military operation.  Secretary Kelly said the military won’t be involved in deportations.  Did the President misspeak?\nMR. SPICER:  So I’ll take the latter first.  The President was using that as an adjective.  It’s happening with precision, and in a manner in which it’s being done very, very clearly.\nI think we’ve made it clear in the past, and Secretary Kelly reiterated it, what kind of operation this was.  But the President was clearly describing the manner in which this was being done.  And so just to be clear on his use of that phrase.  And I think the way it’s being done, by all accounts, is being done with very much a high degree of precision and a flawless manner in terms of making sure that the orders are carried out, and it’s done in a very streamlined and efficient manner.\nI’m sorry, the first part was?\nQ    The first one was about the travel ban.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.  And I think, look, we have made it very clear that we believe that the first one was done in compliance with U.S. code and the authority granted to the President.  This time, the order is finalized.  What we are doing is now in the implementation phase of working with the respective departments and agencies to make sure that when we execute this, it’s done in a manner that’s flawless.\nAnd so it’s not a question of delaying, it’s a question of getting it right.  We’ve taken the Court’s opinions and concerns into consideration, but the order is finalized.  It’s now awaiting implementation.  What we want to do is make sure that we’re working through the departments and agencies so that any concerns or questions are handled on the front end.  But we are acting with appropriate haste and diligence to make sure that the order is done in an appropriate manner.\nQ    I want to ask you about a comment that the Treasury Secretary made today.  He was asked if we should assume that the tax plan that the President is about to roll out will take effect in 2018.  He said, and I’m quoting, “I think we’re looking at that.”  So my question to you is, would the President accept a tax proposal that deals with the timeline of implementation in 2018 but not 2017?\nMR. SPICER:  So, Secretary Mnuchin also made it very clear that his goal is to have this wrapped up by August and implemented.  The question is, or what you’re referring to is what year it actually takes place?\nQ    Right.\nMR. SPICER:  Right, so whether it’s retroactive to tax year 2017 or fiscal year '17.  And I think as the details get --\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, we’ll have more details on that as it moves forward.  I think there’s two issues -- fiscal year '17 and calendar year '17.  And, for taxpayers, it’s obviously calendar year 2017 that they’re probably most concerned with, and I think the President, as we work with Congress, will have those details to be able to flush out.\nI want to go to our first Skype seat of the day.  Neil Vigdor with Hearst Connecticut Media Group.\nQ    Good afternoon, Sean.  Thanks for taking my question.  I appreciate it.  Connecticut’s governor directed police chiefs across the state Wednesday to avoid taking any special action against undocumented immigrants, including honoring immigration detainer requests from ICE.  What will the repercussions be for this state in terms of federal funding it receives from the Trump administration?\nAnd secondly, does the President’s executive order on sanctuary cities apply to those that are undeclared sanctuary cities?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, Neil, I think there’s a couple things.  The idea that Governor Malloy would not want the law followed as enacted by Congress or by the Connecticut legislature in any fashion seems to be concerning, right?  Whether you’re a governor or mayor or the President, laws are passed in this country and we expect people and our lawmakers and our law enforcement agencies to follow and adhere to the laws as passed by the appropriate level of government.\nSo it’s obviously concerning, I think, and it’s troubling that that’s the message that he would send to his people and to other governors.  Because we are a nation of laws, and I think that people need to understand that whether it’s the laws that he passes as the Governor of Connecticut or the laws that are passed through Congress and signed by the President, there’s a reason that our democracy works.  It’s because the people speak, our representatives at every level pass a law, and the executive in that particular branch of government signs or vetoes it, and then we live by those rules.  And the idea that you can decide which laws to agree or not to agree with, or follow or not follow, undermines our entire rule of law.\nAnd so I would suggest that that is not a great sign to be sending to the people of Connecticut and the people of this country, that a particular governor chooses not to follow the duly-passed laws of this nation.\nWith respect to sanctuary cities, I think this is an area that the American people by huge amounts support.  They recognize their tax dollars shouldn’t be spent supporting programs and activities to which people are not entitled to.  And so I think the President has been very clear on this -- that if you are a sanctuary city, declared or undeclared, if you are providing benefits or services, we are going to do everything we can to respect taxpayers and ensure that your states follow the law.\nApril.\nQ    Sean, on the bathroom issue, there was a different comment from the President about, you know, if people like Caitlyn Jenner wanted to use this bathroom in Trump Tower, she could now.  What’s happened?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think that’s -- so just to be clear, the President was asked -- at one point Caitlyn Jenner was in Trump Tower, and he said, that’s great.  That’s consistent with everything he’s said.  It’s a states' rights issue.  And that’s entirely what he believes -- that if a state wants to pass a law or rule, or an organization wants to do something in compliance with the state rule, that’s their right.  But it shouldn’t be the federal government getting in the way of this.\nI mean, if you look at this, the law that was passed in 1972 did not contemplate or consider this issue.  Number two, the procedure for this guidance letter that was done through the Obama administration was not properly followed.  There was no comment period.  There was no input from parents, teachers, students or administrators.  None.\nSo if we think about how this was implemented last administration, there was zero input, there was zero comment period offered.  Teachers and students never had any say in how this was implemented.  Number three, there’s a reason that the Texas court had this matter enjoined.  It’s because it didn’t follow the law and it had procedural problems.\nFour, as I mentioned, it’s a states' rights issue.  And then five is, I think that we do have to recognize that children do enjoy rights, from anti-bullying statutes that are in almost every state, and that there’s a difference between being compassionate for individuals and children who are struggling with something and wanting to make sure they’re protected, and how it’s being done.  And I think that the President has a big heart, as we’ve talked about in a lot of other issues, and there’s a big difference.  Personally, he addressed this issue when it came up with respect to one of his properties.\nBut he also believes that that’s not a federal government issue.  It’s an issue left to the states, and it’s an issue that -- I mean, there’s a reason in August of last year that the court enjoined this, because it hadn’t followed the law and it hadn’t -- the procedure, the comment period and the solicitation of opinions and ideas wasn’t followed.  It was jammed down the process.\nAnd so we’re actually following the law on this one, and I think that’s the way it’s supposed to be done.\nJohn.\nQ    If I could just follow on what April said.  The Human Rights Campaign --\nQ    I wasn’t finished, I’m sorry.\nQ    Well, I’m following on your question.  Let me follow --\nQ    I understand that, but --\nMR. SPICER:  Why don’t we let April follow on and then we’ll get to John, Kristen and Brian.\nQ    Yeah.  So I have one on -- I have something on another issue really fast, then John can do that.  On the HBCU executive order, we understand the executive order that’s coming out sometime later this month, it’s supposed to open -- you’re working out issues of opening an office specifically to take the HBCU initiative out of the Department of Education and bring it directly under the purview of the White House.  Who will be heading that?  Have you figured that out?  Have you also figured out how you will build that office out?  Because from what I understand, that is one of the big pieces of this.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, respectfully, that’s why it hasn’t been issued yet.  We’re working it through the process.  Obviously, that is something that we’re committed to getting done by the end of Black History Month.  So our days are numbered, but there’s a commitment by the President and the staff to really focus on this issue and give it the proper respect that it deserves.  So if you’ll bear with us a couple more days, I promise you we’ll have more to say on that.\nQ    So it will be a department with the full --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, I just want to be clear, I’m not going to get into the details.  Sort of my blanket statement on non-issued executive orders.  But I do know that there is a commitment by the President and the staff that he has been very clear with us that he wants that done by the end of this month for obvious reasons.\nNow John.\nQ    Let me get back to where we were.  The Human Rights Campaign, in responding to rescinding the guidance last night, said that this is not a states' rights issue, it’s a civil rights issue, and therefore is in the purview of the federal government.  Do you disagree that this a civil rights issue?\nMR. SPICER:  It’s not a -- it’s a question of where it’s appropriately addressed.  And I think there’s a reason -- like, we’ve got to remember, this guidance was enjoined last August by a court.  It hasn’t been enforced.  There was no comment period by anyone -- by the Human Rights Campaign, by teachers, parents, students.  Nobody had any input of this.\nAnd it seems to me a little interesting that if this was any other issue, people would be crying foul that the process wasn’t followed.  The reality is, is that when you look at Title IX, it was enacted in 1972.  The idea that this was even contemplated at that is preposterous on its face.  But that doesn’t mean that the President -- the President obviously understands the issue and the challenges that especially young children face.  He just believes that this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by states, as he does with a lot of other issues that we’ve talked about.\nAnd so this is -- we are a states' rights party.  The President on a lot of issues believes in these various issues being states' rights.  I don’t see why this would be any different.  And again, if you go through it, it’s not just -- it’s how the guidance was issued, it’s the legal basis on which it was ordered.  It fell short on a lot of stuff.\nIt wasn’t us that did this; it was the court that stepped in and said that they hadn’t followed the procedure of the law back in August of last year and enjoin the case.\nQ    I understand all that, I’m just wondering if -- does the White House disagree with the position that this is a civil right?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think it’s not a question of whether it’s a civil right, it’s where is it appropriately addressed.  And as I noted, it’s appropriately addressed at the state level.\nKelly.\nQ    Can I follow on that?  Sean, does the President believe, personally believe that any student who is transgender should be able to use the bathroom of their choice?  His personal belief?\nMR. SPICER:  The President believes it’s a states' rights issue.  And he’s not going to get into determining -- I understand what you’re asking, Kelly.  And I think that, as April pointed out, when the issue came to one of his own properties he was very clear.  But again, what he doesn’t want to do is force his issues or beliefs down -- he believes it’s a states' rights issue --\nQ    But the public may want to know where the President is on this issue.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that, and I think that he is very sympathetic to children who deal with that and that this is up to states and schools within a particular district to address how they want to accommodate that, and not sort of be prescriptive from Washington.  That’s what the President believes.\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  You mentioned that this order was enjoined by a court and there was criticism about the process.  That exact same criticism has been levied on the administration’s first executive order, on the travel ban.  I mean, can you help us square the circle here?  Why are you relying on that same “enjoined by a federal court” criticism of the process for one but not the other?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s a big difference.  There’s no way that you can read Title IX from 1972 -- anybody -- and say that that was even contemplated back then.  It just -- there’s nobody that is possibly suggesting that the law that was passed in 1972 did that.\nNumber two, there was zero comment period put forward on this guidance, which is in violation of how it was executed, okay?  And so there’s a big difference -- hold on, hold, on let me answer the question, Zeke.  There is also a strong reading when you read 1182 U.S. Code that it is very clear that the President does have the authority.\nSo they are very much apples and oranges issue.  One, it’s very clear that the President is told by Congress in U.S. code that he has the authority to do what’s necessary to protect the American people.  And there’s no way that anybody above a fifth grade reading level could interpret that different.  There is a difference between looking at a statute from 1972 and saying that something was complicated back then.\nNot only that -- again, it’s a multifaceted thing.  When you look at how the guidance was issued, there was a zero comment period.  Nobody was able to weigh in on that situation back then.  And so when you’re talking about forcing schools to make a huge accommodation from the federal level, and schools, parents, teachers, kids were not able to have any input in that decision from Washington, I think it’s a very, very clear difference.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Just going back two weeks, in a story that got relatively little attention at the time -- Chuck Cooper, a very distinguished lawyer, asked that his name be withdrawn when he was on the periphery of being named U.S. Solicitor General.  So my question is a two-parter.  First, can you confirm or deny the administration is now vetting Mr. Miguel Estrada, who was a former nominee for the Court of Appeals, as Solicitor General before the visa delay case gets to the Supreme Court?\nAnd second, Mr. Cooper said that he did not want to go through the same experience that Jeff Sessions, his good friend, did when he had the confirmation hearings and the vote in the Senate.  Does that make the President a little bit discouraged about getting the nominees he wants for some very important positions?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, thanks, John.  And I’d say - on the first part, as you know -- and I’ll give you the same answer we give executive orders -- we don’t comment on personnel decisions until they’re made, until they’re finalized.  So I’ve got nothing for that.\nOn the second part, what I would say is that the President is very confident we have a deep bench of folks who -- during the transition, we talked about this -- a number of people who have expressed a huge interest in joining the President in fulfilling this agenda.  And that list is robust and long.\nHowever, that being said, I think for folks who have to go through the Senate confirmation and to watch what has happened to some of these fine individuals -- the delay tactics, the tearing apart of their personal lives -- it is discouraging for some of these people, I think, in terms of Mr. Cooper and others who are looking at the process saying, I would like to be part of this administration, help fulfill this vision and this agenda, but this is what I’m going to have go through.\nSo while this is somewhat of an isolated case, I definitely understand what he’s talking about here.  And I think those are few and far between, but I think that when you realize what is happening largely at the expense of Senate Democrats, in terms of dragging these people through a very, very delayed and arduous process for purely political points, I think that there are some people who could look at the process and potentially say I don't want to serve.\nLuckily, we've not come to that beyond a handful of folks.  Largely, people have huge desire and are willing to make great sacrifice -- both financially and personally -- to serve in the administration because I think they understand what potential change this President is bringing to this country and to the city.  But I understand his point.\nQ    This morning, the President talked about, as he often does when he talks about immigrants, he talks about really bad dudes.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    You talked about precision.  The Homeland Security Secretary this morning insisted there won’t be mass deportation.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    Is it the President’s intent or desire, as some advocates worry, that people who are here illegally with something as simple as a traffic violation, that those people will be subject to deportation?  Yes or no?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think everybody who is in this country for obvious reasons -- if you overstay a visa, if you commit a crime, you can't -- by the very nature of you not being legal, you can be subject to deportation.  That's by definition.  Being in this country is a privilege, not a right, if you are a visitor.  And I think we have a right to make sure that the people who are in this country are here for good and peaceful processes.\nAnd as I’ve said over and over again, there is a big difference.  The President recognizes that there are millions of people in the country who are not here legally, and that we have to have a very systematic and pragmatic and methodical process of going through those individuals to make sure that the people who pose a threat to public safety or have a criminal record are the first that are gone.\nWhat we've done -- just to be clear -- is to untie the hands of ICE and Border Patrol agents and say, your job is to enforce the law -- first and foremost to figure out who poses a threat to us.  But in the previous administration their hands had been tied.  There was exception after exception after exception.  And the fact of the matter is, is that we have to -- we are a nation of laws, and we have to have a system of legal immigration that is respected.\nSo I’m not going to be prescriptive in terms of what ICE’s job is.  But needless to say, their job and their mission is to protect the country and to enforce our borders and our immigration laws.  And the President has basically instructed them to carry out their mission.  And so the priorities, as we've discussed over and over and over again, is to do that is in accordance with the law but also prioritizes those people that pose a threat.\nI’m going to go to Roby Brock from the Talk Business & Politics in -- where is he from?  Arkansas.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Roby Brock with Talk Business & Politics here in Arkansas, the home of the rowdiest town halls in the nation.\nI have a question on medical marijuana.  Our state voters passed a medical marijuana amendment in November.  Now we're in conflict with federal law, as many other states are.  The Obama administration kind of chose not to strictly enforce those federal marijuana laws.  My question to you is:  With Jeff Sessions over at the Department of Justice as AG, what’s going to be the Trump administration’s position on marijuana legalization where it’s in a state-federal conflict like this?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Roby.  There’s two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana.\nI think medical marijuana, I’ve said before that the President understands the pain and suffering that many people go through who are facing especially terminal diseases and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them.  And that's one that Congress, through a rider in 2011 -- looking for a little help -- I think put in an appropriations bill saying the Department of Justice wouldn’t be funded to go after those folks.\nThere is a big difference between that and recreational marijuana.  And I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing that we should be doing is encouraging people.  There is still a federal law that we need to abide by in terms of the medical -- when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature.\nSo I think there’s a big difference between medical marijuana, which states have a -- the states where it’s allowed, in accordance with the appropriations rider, have set forth a process to administer and regulate that usage, versus recreational marijuana.  That’s a very, very different subject.\nShannon.\nQ    What does that mean in terms of policy?  A follow-up, Sean.  What does that mean in terms of policy?\nMR. SPICER:  Shannon.  Glenn, this isn’t a TV program.  We’re going to --\nQ    What is the Justice Department going to do?\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, you don’t get to just yell out questions.  We’re going to raise our hands like big boys and girls.\nQ    Why don’t you answer the question, though?\nMR. SPICER:  Because it’s not your job to just yell out questions.\nShannon, please go.\nQ    Okay.  Well, first, on the manufacturing summit, was the AFL-CIO invited?  And then, yeah, I did want to follow up on this medical marijuana question.  So is the federal government then going to take some sort of action around this recreational marijuana in some of these states?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that’s a question for the Department of Justice.  I do believe that you’ll see greater enforcement of it.  Because again, there’s a big difference between the medical use which Congress has, through an appropriations rider in 2014, made very clear what their intent was in terms of how the Department of Justice would handle that issue.  That’s very different than the recreational use, which is something the Department of Justice I think will be further looking into.\nI’m sorry, Shannon, what was the first part?\nQ    Was the AFL-CIO invited to the manufacturing meeting today with the CFOs?  Because they are part of this manufacturing --\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  I think this was just focused on people who actually -- they were not, I don’t believe, part of this one.  As you know, that we’ve had union representation at other meetings.  I think this was specifically for people who are hiring people and the impediments that they’re having to create additional jobs, hire more people.  And obviously, while the President values their opinion -- and that’s why they’ve been involved in some of the past -- this was specifically a manufacturing -- people who hire people, who manufacture, who grow the economy, who grow jobs.  And that is a vastly different situation.\nAndrei.\nQ    I specifically sat here next to John to have --\nMR. SPICER:  One can see --\nQ    You know me.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  A question on Russia.  Secretary Tillerson and General Dunford have had meetings with their Russian counterparts.  Is the President pleased with the results of the meetings?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    And what comes next?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, both of them had an opportunity to meet with their counterparts in different locations, ironically on the same day.  I believe that was yesterday.  And they both had very, very productive discussions.  The President was very pleased with the outcome of that, and so I would refer you back to both General Dunford and Secretary Tillerson on those.\nQ    You started discussing the where and when for the summit for the leaders meeting?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t have any updates on that, but I’ll look into that.\nCecilia.\nQ    Sean, I just want to follow up.  I want to clarify, make sure I understand what you said.  You said, you will see greater enforcement of it?\nMR. SPICER:  I would refer you to the Department of Justice --\nQ    But you said, you said there will be greater enforcement.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no.  I know.  I know what I -- I think -- then that’s what I said.  But I think the Department of Justice is the lead on that.  It is something that you should follow up with them, but I believe that they are going to continue to enforce the laws on the books with respect to recreational marijuana versus --\nQ    Okay.  And my real question if you don’t mind.\nMR. SPICER:  That first one was pretty real.\nQ    Ivanka Trump was in the White House today for a meeting on human trafficking.  She had this meeting on CEOs.  We saw her in a smaller session here at the White House today.  What exactly is her role here?\nMR. SPICER:  I think her role is to be helpful and provide input on a variety of areas that she has deep, passionate concerns about, especially in the area of women in the workforce and empowering women.  She is someone who has a lot of expertise and wants to offer that, especially in the area of trying to help women.  She understands that firsthand.  And I think because of the success that she’s had, her goal is to try to figure out -- and the understanding that she has a businesswoman -- to use her expertise and understanding to empower and help women have the same kind of opportunity and success that she’s had.  So --\nQ    But still not a formal role?\nMR. SPICER:  No, nothing more than you’ve seen now.  I think, last night, the meeting that she had in Baltimore was one that was done on her own.  There’s areas that she’s cared very passionately about before her time in the White House, or before her father coming to the White House, rather.  And now that her father is in the White House, she continues to seek a platform that helps empower and lift up women, and give them opportunities and think of ways that they can be --\nQ    Sean, thanks.  On the human trafficking meeting today, the President said, well, when you talk about solving this kind of problem, that’s a nice word, but it’s really -- he suggested that, more likely, he could just help out on that problem.  What’s his definition of success in this?  What’s his goal?  Is he looking at stronger criminal penalties?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, Dave, I think that’s, as I read out earlier, that the President understands that this is a serious problem both for adults, but particularly for children who are being sold both domestically and internationally, and it’s why we brought these groups in.  It’s to make sure that we figure out how do we make that number as close to zero as possible and that we institute policies both domestically, but then abroad, and working with our partners to figure out how do we combat the trafficking of people.\nSo it’s things that we can be forceful in terms of the rhetoric that the President uses, but also the enforcement tools that he uses both domestically and internationally.\nTrey.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Has the President been briefed at all on the situation at Standing Rock?  And is he concerned that a stand-off with protesters could slow down his executive orders on pipelines?\nMR. SPICER:  Our team has been involved with both the tribe and the governor there, and so we are not only -- we are constantly in touch with them.  And I think we feel very confident that we will move forward to get the pipeline moving.  And so we’ll have a further update on that, but I think we're in constant contact with the officials there.\nKristen.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  Two topics I’d like to ask, but I wanted to start off by following on the transgender directive.  Eight-two percent of transgender children report feeling unsafe at school.  So isn’t the President leaving some of these children open to vulnerable -- to being bullied at school?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  I mean, there are bullying laws and policies in place in almost every one of these schools.\nQ    Transgender children say their experience is --\nMR. SPICER:  But I don't think -- hold on --\nQ    -- not being able to use the bathroom that they feel comfortable using because of vulnerability to bullying.\nMR. SPICER:  But again, you're missing the point here, Kristen.  The President said literally it should be a state decision.  He respects the decision of the state.  So therefore --\nQ    So respecting kids is a states’ rights issue?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, that's not -- you're trying to make an issue out of something that doesn't exist.  It was the court who stopped this in August of last year.  So where were the questions last year in August about this?  It wasn’t implemented correctly, legally, and the procedure wasn’t followed because the court found, at the time, that it didn't have the authority to do that.  So you’re asking us why we're following the law that wasn’t followed.  And the reality is --\nQ    Well, I'm asking you why you're reversing the Obama directive --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  No, no, we're not reversing it.  Hold on.  We're not reversing it.  That is a misinterpretation of the scenario.  The court stopped it.  It enjoined it in August of last year because it wasn’t properly drafted, and it didn't follow the procedures, and there was no legal basis for it in a law that was instituted in 1972.\nSo hold on -- for you to use those terms, frankly, doesn't reflect what the situation actually is and how it happened.  That's just -- so to talk about us reversing something that was stopped by the courts.\nQ    I understand that --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, but --\nQ    -- but you're sending a message --\nMR. SPICER:  No, we're not.  We're basically saying that it’s a states’ rights issue.  If a state choses to do it, as I mentioned to April, when this circumstance came up at one of the President’s own properties, he was very clear about his position on this.  So for you to turn around and say what message is the President saying, where was the message when he sent it last year?  I think the message shows that he’s a guy with a heart that understands the trouble that many people go through.\nBut he also believes that the proper legal recourse for this is with the states.  He believes in the states’ ability to determine what’s right for their state versus another state.\nQ    I understand what you're saying.  But the LGBTQ community yesterday said they felt --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand what --\nQ    -- that what they perceiving is that those kids are not being respected.\nMR. SPICER:  But there’s a difference what people may or may not feel and the legal process and the law.  And the law right now doesn't allow for it under Title IX that was passed in 1972.  And the procedure wasn’t followed.  The court saw this in August of last year for a reason.  And all we're doing is saying that the proper place for this is in the states.\nAnd so for you to suggest what message is this sending, it’s very simple:  that it’s a states’ rights issue, and the states should enact laws that reflect the values, principles, and will of the people in their particular state.  That's it, plain and simple.\nQ    Moving on to Obamacare very quickly, former House Speaker John Boehner predicted that a full repeal and replace of Obamacare -- his words -- “is not going to happen.”  He went on to say, “Most of the framework of the Affordable Care Act, it’s going to be there.”  Do you think that he has a point?  Are you going to --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, no, I think -- look, I think what we're going to end up with is something that I’ve talked about over and over again.  We're going to end up with a more accessible plan that will allow people to see more doctors, have more providers, and drive costs down.  Those are the two guiding principles that we're going to have in what the President is going to work with Congress to put forward on.  That's it, plain and simple.\nYes.\nQ    Sean, on roads and highways in the United States, in many places around the country potholes and other issues are affecting the way in which Americans travel.  And the President has said he would fix these issues during the campaign.  What is the status on that?  And has the President spoken to heads of DOT or other people?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President is starting to address that through the budget process we talked about yesterday.  It will be out in mid-March.  And so the infrastructure projects and priorities that the President has talked about -- whether it’s air control, and our airports, or the roads and bridges -- will be something that he’s going to work with DOT, but also talk about in his budget.  And you’ll see more in his joint address to Congress.\nWith that, Laurel Staples of KECI-NBC in Montana.\nQ    Montana has hundreds of miles of border with Canada.  And according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, almost 1 million people come across that border into Montana each year.  What are the administration’s plans to increase security on the Canadian border?  And does the administration have any plans to build a wall there?  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  Well, we're obviously concerned -- thank you -- at all sorts of immigration in this country, whether it’s from our northern border or our southern border.  I think the President understands that our southern border is where we have more of a concern in terms of the number of people and the type of activity that's coming over there in terms of the cartels and drug activity.  But that doesn't mean that we're not paying attention to our northern border, as well.  And we will continue to both monitor and take steps necessary at our northern border to ensure the safety of all Americans.\nYes, sir.\nQ    One question on the South China Sea and a follow-up on the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nThis week was the first week, I believe, that the Trump administration launched freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea.  Can you give us a sense of how frequently you are going to be doing those?\nAnd then on the Dakota Access Pipeline, a few weeks ago President Trump said he would try to negotiate a solution between the Standing Rock Sioux and Energy Transfer Partners.  Why hasn’t the President intervened and tried to initiate those negotiations yet?\nMR. SPICER:  So on the latter, our team has been in contact with all the parties involved.  They have been working and communicating back and forth.  So if we have an update on that -- but there has been work at the staff level between the parties.\nAnd then on the second -- on the first part, I’ve got no further update in terms of the frequency by which we will have stuff.\nAlexis.\nQ    Sean, in the Reuters interview with the President, he described again his interest in seeing the nuclear arsenal expand in the United States.  Can you describe what it is that the President has in mind -- the timeframe and how he would like to pursue that?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes, let’s just be clear.  He didn't -- what he was very clear on is that the United States will not yield its supremacy in this area to anybody.  That's what he made very clear in there.  And that if other countries have nuclear capabilities, it will always be the United States that has the supremacy and commitment to this.\nObviously, that's not what we're seeking to do.  The question that was asked was about other people growing their stockpiles.  And I think what he has been clear on is that our goal is to make sure that we maintain America’s dominance around the world, and that if other countries cloud it, we don't sit back and allow them to grow theirs.\nFrancesca.\nQ    Sean, a domestic policy question and then a foreign policy question, if you will.  You said yesterday that the President had named a task force on the voter fraud probe.  When did he name that task force specifically?\nMR. SPICER:  I think two weeks ago he announced that Vice President Pence would lead that task force, and that the Vice President and his team were starting to look at members to do that.\nQ    So you were referring to the interview in which he said there would be a task force.\nMR. SPICER:  That's right.\nQ    Not that something has happened since then.\nMR. SPICER:  That's correct.\nQ    Okay.  And then on foreign policy, the President had said in his Saturday campaign speech that the Gulf States would be paying for that safe zone in Syria.  Which Gulf States was he referring to?  Have any committed to paying for that?\nMR. SPICER:  So if you look at the readouts that he’s had with several of the foreign leaders that is brought up and mentioned in almost every one of them.  And I think he’s talked about the financing of the safe zones and the commitment that they need to make to those.  And I think by and large, we've had widespread commitment.  When we have an update on -- and I think that's an issue that's going to be ongoing at the Secretary of State level, as well, where you saw Secretary Tillerson follow up on that with numerous folks.\nWe will have further updates on the funding of safe zones as we go forward.  But there has been a general commitment by most of these heads of government to share in the President’s commitment to help fund these things.\nCan I go to Steve Gruber of WJIM in Michigan?\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  I greatly appreciate it.  I’d like to talk to you more about tax policy, if I may.  President Trump, of course, on the campaign trail talked a lot about tax policy and tax reform.  That hasn’t happened yet, as we know.  But I want to talk about something different.  That's the border adjustability tax.  With the manufacturers that were at the White House again today, states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, others have a great concern about this tax, and there seems to be a disconnect between some of the CEOs, some of the Republicans on Capitol Hill and the President as to whether or not this is appropriate.\nAnd I guess the question is:  Could this tax have a chilling effect on manufacturing at a time when places like Ohio, and Michigan, and the Upper Midwest are trying to jumpstart the economy with manufacturing jobs?  I wish for you to clarify, if you could, the President’s position.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes, Steve, thank you.  I think the President has been very clear from the beginning that there is no tax if companies manufacture in the United States.  We are one of only a handful of countries that doesn't tax the imports that come into our country.  Almost every other country operates their tax code under that system.\nAnd so what happens is we have a system by which companies abroad can send their products -- tax our products going into their country and institute an import tax, and then their products come into the United States with no import tax -- which, frankly, gives a disincentive to companies to stay in the United States, to manufacture in the United States, to hire in the United States.  And it tilts the field against the American worker.\nAnd so the President is looking at tax policy that encourages manufacturing and job creation in the United States.  And if you think about it --\nQ    So where is he on this border adjustability tax?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.\nQ    Where is he on this tax specifically?\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I think that what he is doing is he met yesterday with his team on the budget.  He’s talked to Secretary Mnuchin and others who are working on a comprehensive tax reform plan.  And remember, Steve, this isn’t something that's been done since 1986.  And so as we look at it, part of that is to make sure that we lower our corporate tax rate, that we make it more attractive to manufacture and grow jobs in the United States, to make our companies more competitive with companies overseas that, frankly, have better tax treatment than our own companies who stay in the United States.  So creating more of a playing field that encourages manufacturing and growing and creating in the United States.\nBut make no mistake, if a company is in the United States already and expanding in the United States, it will be only to their benefit.  Actually, if you think about it right now, the way the current tax code works, it almost incentivizes companies from leaving the United States, manufacturing, and expanding overseas, and then sending their goods and services back to the United States, which undermines our own economy, it undermines our workers.\nQ    But the question is about components coming back in the United States being manufactured.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand, Steve.  Okay, I know that you're on the Skype, but we only do like one or two follow-ups.\nBut the answer is, is that he’s working towards comprehensive tax reform, and we’ll have a plan out within the next few weeks that will address that.\nYes.\nQ    On the transgender guidance, the administration not only rescinded it, but sent a letter to the Supreme Court informing them about the change as they consider a related case.  Does the termination of the guidance present an administration position on the way the Supreme Court should rule?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m sorry, on?  Well, obviously, we’re -- I’m sorry -- removing the guidance clearly does.  The guidance that was put forward by the Obama administration, which clearly hadn’t been done in a proper way in terms of how they solicited, or, rather, didn’t solicit comments -- the guidance it puts forward obviously sends a signal to the Court on where the administration stands on this issue.\nQ    Can I ask you about Syria?  Two quick questions.  First, the talks have started again, peace talks in Geneva.  The man convening them, Staffan de Mistura, says he’s not detected a clear strategy on the political track from the administration.  So what is the President’s thinking on that?  And in particular, what’s his thinking on the future of President Assad, whether he can stay on in a transition or --\nMR. SPICER:  I will refer you to the State Department on the status of the talks.\nQ    But the overall strategy comes from here.\nMR. SPICER:  Right, I understand that.  And that’s one of the things that the President, whether it’s safe zones or how we deal with Syria and the problems that --\nQ    What's the President thinking on Assad’s future?  Just the key points.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that, thank you.\nQ    One other question then on Syria, if you don’t mind.  The fall of al-Bab in northern Syria, an important development on the battlefield, creates some space in that town that’s fallen to the Turks and opposition.  Is that the sort of space that the President would like to see a safe zone?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t -- we’re not trying to be prescriptive right now in terms of the geographic location of a safe zone.  It’s something that -- right now, the President’s goal is to get commitments from other world leaders, both in terms of the funding and the commitment to share in how we do that.\nSo I don’t want to get -- we’re not looking to be prescriptive today in how it’s done.  I think, overall, we need a greater commitment in the region to make sure that people are committed to a strategy and to safe zones to allow that to stop some of the human suffering that’s going on and create -- while the rest of the conflict ensues.  And I think that we’ve got to dual-track this -- deal with the conflict as a whole and how we address it, how we deal with ISIS in combatting it, but then we also have to -- there’s a humanitarian piece to this as well with respect to the safe zones.\nAnd I think that we were looking at both pieces of this as well.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Since the election, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has expressed some disquiet about pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change.  And the President has also heard from some world leaders about that.  Can you tell us, is the President still committed to pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change?\nMR. SPICER:  I think I will leave that to Secretary Tillerson.  That’s a conversation that he’s having with him as far as where we are on that.\nQ    Sean, thank you very much.  I just have a follow-up to the Syria question first.  Do you have any timeline when it comes to when he wants to see those safe zones actually being built?  And I wanted to go back to the executive order on immigration.  You’ve talked about these dual-tracks, where you’re going to be doing the new executive order but also continuing to fight that in court.  Can you give us a status update on where that legal fight is and what we should see happening?\nMR. SPICER:  So with respect to the executive order, there are several courts that this is being fought in -- 10 or so -- and we continue to deal with that in all of those venues.  And then again, I guess, the only way to say this is, then obviously on the dual-track side we have the additional executive order that we’ve talked about earlier that will come out and further address the problems.\nWe continue to believe that the issues that we face specifically in the 9th district -- 9th Circuit, rather, that we will prevail on, on the merits of that.  But on the other challenges that have come and the other venues and the others -- that we feel equally confident, as we did in Massachusetts and other venues.  So it’s not a single-track system.\nAnd I’m sorry, I know you --\nQ    Have you made a decision yet about the Supreme Court taking it there?  And then the other question was on the safe zones and the timeline.\nMR. SPICER:  So with respect to the Supreme Court, I mean, we’ve got to continue to work this through the process.  So right now it’s at the 9th Circuit.  That’s the primary problem that we are addressing.  And then we don’t have any timeline that I can announce today on Syrian safe zones.\nQ    I just want to follow up to this morning’s meeting.  And the President said that he gave authorization to a couple of countries to buy military equipment from the United States.  Which countries was he referring to?  And has he gone to Congress to ask for permission to do this?\nMR. SPICER:  We’ll follow up and get a list for you on that.\nJeff.\nQ    Sean, if I could ask again about the delay of the executive order until the next week.  Is the administration still trying to craft its legal argument to this to withstand scrutiny, or why again the delay?  I’m not sure I understand --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, and I think I asked and answered this earlier.\nQ    Sorry, I don’t understand the delay.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, then I’ll explain it to you.  I think the President this time -- we were very careful to understand what the court’s concerns were and address them in the follow-up executive order.  With respect to when we’re going to announce it, part of this is to make sure that we work with the appropriate departments and agencies on the implementation of it to make sure that it is executed and it continues to be executed in a flawless manner, and that it meets the intent that it would serve.\nWe understand the challenges that may come, and so we want to do this in a manner that makes sure that the Hill, other members of Congress, the appropriate agencies and departments are fully ready to implement this when it’s issued.  And so that’s it.  There’s really nothing more to it.\nQ    There also is some concern -- if I can follow up -- there also is concern inside the Justice Department and in Homeland Security by some officials this afternoon that we’re reporting that the White House is looking for them to help build this legal argument, to find a conclusion here.\nMR. SPICER:  No, that’s not -- basically, you’re saying that we did our due diligence.  We looked to the departments to ask them to review certain things.  So last week it was we rushed stuff; this week, you’re saying that we are taking our time and --\nQ    Has it been more difficult than you thought it would be?\nMR. SPICER:  No, that’s not true.  I don’t think so.  And I think you using continued unnamed sources -- I think it actually is a -- it will be implemented flawlessly because we’ve done the right thing and gone to these individuals, sought feedback and guidance, and done this in an unbelievably comprehensive way to ensure that departments and agencies that are going to be executing and implementing this fully are aware of what’s happening.  But this has been done in a very, very comprehensive way.\nYeah, sorry.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Melanie Arter, CNSNews.com.  Former Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder admitted that for a few years he unwittingly employed an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper.  Is this administration committed to holding employers accountable when they employ illegal aliens?  And how does the administration plan to do so?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think that was -- that issue was something that Mr. Puzder was very forthcoming on.  And when he recognized the situation that had occurred, he paid all the appropriate taxes and tried to help the individual go through the proper process.  And so, yeah, we’re going to continue to make sure that we hold individuals in compliance with the law.  And he did the right thing then, but whether it’s companies or individuals, I think, we are committed to making sure that people do what’s right.\nYes, ma’am.\nQ    Veronica Clearly, with Fox 5.  I have two questions.  Janet Evancho -- she sang the National Anthem -- she requested a meeting with the President.  Her sister is transgender.  Is he going to take that meeting, or meet with anyone from the transgender community during this conversation?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think the President would be welcome to meet with her.\nQ    The second question -- second question.  Steve Bannon today called the media the opposition party.  Last week, there was lots of conversation about the fake news and us being the enemy of the people.  Some have said that this is really just a branding of the media, where he did that in the primaries, branding “Little Marco” and “Lyin’ Ted”.  Is this --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, no, that was the President.  Just to --\nQ    Right, of course.  But is this a branding strategy to --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think that’s what Steve believes.\nQ    But this is real.\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely, of course, it’s real.  I don’t think he’d go out -- Steve has been very clear about his position on the media and how he believes it distorts things.  So I don’t think there’s --\nQ    From the whole administration?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no.  Hold on.  I just said that that is what Steve’s view is.  He’s made it several times, and I think he’s very clear on that.\nSarah.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Back to the border adjustment tax.  President Trump has told Reuters that he does support some form of a border tax.  How does the President respond to critics that are saying the border adjustment tax will be passed on to lower-income and middle-class families in the form of higher prices for goods and higher prices for gas?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think if you look at holistically -- I mean, the first thing to understand is that there is no tax if you’re manufacturing in the United States, so there can be no higher cost.  But if you think about it right now, we have to look at this in a holistic way, which is, when a company chooses to leave our country and shed American jobs so they can move overseas, and then sell back to us at a lower price, there’s a big cost that comes to our economy and to our workers.  And so we’ve got to look at this comprehensively.\nBut if a company chooses to stay and grow in the United States, hire more people, it actually will be a net savings, if you think about it, because it will be the companies who are overseas, who have chosen to move out of the country who will face a higher cost under these kind of plans.\nAnd that’s a big difference.  It will actually benefit consumers, benefit workers, and benefit out economy.  And that’s -- when you really think about the economic impact about that, that benefits our economy, it helps our American workers, it grows more jobs, it grows the manufacturing base.  And again, we are probably one of only a handful of developed countries that don’t have a tax system that looks at this.  And so right now, it’s America and American workers and American manufacturing that are the disadvantage of the current regulatory and tax system, not the other way around.\nThank you, guys.  Have a great day.  We’ll touch base tomorrow in some way.  I will see you then.  Tune in to CPAC to see the President.\nEND\n3:52 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:55 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I wanted to wait until the President finished up with his remarks on the budget before I came out.  As you saw, he's -- a really good opportunity to sit down with his team.  It's clearly been a busy day here at the White House again, so I'm going to kind of keep it quick and get to your questions.\nThis morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Secretary of State Tillerson.  As you all know, Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly will travel to Mexico City later today as one of their first foreign trips.  It’s significant that the President is sending the secretaries to Mexico so early in the administration.\nIt’s symbolic of the meaningful relationship that our two nations have.  These are important meetings regarding the President’s agenda to improve the quality of lives for both people of Mexico and the United States by combatting drug traffickers and finding ways to bolster both our economies through a broader relationship that promotes commerce and legal immigration.  This is a very encouraging start to a working relationship with an incredible neighbor to the south.\nAt this moment, the President has just wrapped up his discussions on the federal budget with some of the officials and staff who will be instrumental in the work to put this country back on a responsibly fiscal path.\nJoining the meeting were Reince Priebus, the Chief of Staff; Steve Bannon; Jared Kushner; Gary Cohn, the Director of the National Economic Council; Secretary Steve Mnuchin of the Department of Treasury; Director Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget; Russ Vought of the Office of Management and Budget; and Emma Doyle of Office of Management and Budget.\nAs the President mentioned last week, we look forward to presenting our tax reform plan and providing much-needed tax reform and relief to the hardworking men and women of our nation.  The President is going to restore and respect the American taxpayer by enabling them to keep more of their hard-earned money, and by making sure the federal government spends money more responsibly.  After the lunch, the President will continue this important discussion with other members of the senior staff.\nAdditionally, the Vice President today is in St. Louis to participate in listening sessions with American workers and employees of the Fabick Cat equipment and engineer* [engine] dealer, a 100-year-old family-owned and operated business.\nDuring his visit, the Vice President will discuss the economic comeback in store for our nation under the President’s economic agenda and with small business owners and employees.  The President has already made strides towards slashing redundant regulations through his executive actions, and we will work with Congress to enact further pro-growth legislation.\nBack to the President’s schedule.  Later this afternoon, the President will participate in his standing legislative affairs strategy session.  Our legislative affairs team is in constant contact with our counterparts on the Hill, keeping an open dialogue on all aspects of the President’s agenda.  Last week alone, more than 40 different senators and members of Congress visited the White House.\nOn the Supreme Court front, so far Judge Gorsuch has met with 58 senators -- 36 Republicans and 22 Democrats -- and he has more meetings already on the books for next week when the Senate returns to session.  We’ve been especially encouraged by the reception he’s received from several senior Democrats, including Senators Feinstein, Tester, Durbin, and Gillibrand.\nAlso on the confirmation front, multiple unions came out today for Alex Acosta, the President’s nominee for Labor Secretary. Both the Laborers' International Union of North America and the International Union of Operating Engineers praised his distinguished career and pledged their support for his nomination.\nThe legislative affairs team is using the congressional work period to coordinate with key coalitions in Congress.  They are meeting with different groups in the House and Senate, including the staff of the Congressional Black Caucus, House and Senate leadership, and staff throughout various committees.  We’ve used this work period as an opportunity to invite staffers from both sides of the aisle to come to the White House and discuss shared priorities and find common ground on the way forward.\nAnd we’re not just reaching out to Capitol Hill, we've actively engaged with key leaders and policymakers around the country.  It’s critical to this administration that we gather input from states and from people throughout the country, rather than just leaders here in Washington.\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the President will meet with a group of world-class business leaders to discuss specific actions he can take to remove barriers to job creation.  These leaders, many of whom represent some of the country’s largest manufacturers, will begin the day in working groups with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides of the President’s staff.  The working groups will engage in a deep-dive conversation on the attendees’ specific areas of expertise. Topics of discussion include deregulation, tax and trade, training and the workforce of the future, and infrastructure.\nVice President Pence will be engaged with each of the groups.  And after the groups conclude their discussion, the President’s staff will compile the feedback and the President will sit down with the entire group for a listening session on some of their recommendations.\nAs you can tell by the structure of the meeting, the President is expecting these interactions to lead to real action being taken by the administration.  Creating a dynamic and booming economy that works for all Americans continues to be at the top of his domestic policy agenda.  As a successful businessman himself, the President knows that if we’re going to get the country back to work, we need to hear directly from job creators what is holding them back, and, where appropriate, take steps to remove the barriers.\nIn his first month in office, the President has already taken numerous actions to boost job creation, and key economic indicators are showing that it’s working.  CEO and [consumer] confidence are up, the stock market continues to reach record highs, and the January numbers were strong.  The meetings on Thursday will continue to build on that momentum.\nAnd with that, I’m glad to take some questions.  Steve Holland.\nQ    Steve Holland is not here.\nMR. SPICER:  Sorry, Jeff Mason gets it.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Can you give us an update on the administration's plans with regard to transgender bathrooms in schools?  And can you confirm that there has been some disagreement between Secretary DeVos and the Attorney General on this issue?\nMR. SPICER:  So I would expect further guidance to come out on that today.  The President, as I said yesterday, is a firm believer in states' rights.  When you look at the guidance that was issued under the Obama administration -- first of all, let's remember, to the best of my knowledge, that was stalled and never fully implemented.  And I think there were various reasons for that -- several legal reasons and several procedural reasons.  And so the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, both who jointly issued that guidance back during the Obama administration, are now working together again under a Trump administration, they've been reviewing the guidance that was signed, the basis by which it was put through.  And I think there have been several areas of concern, both legal and procedural, that they have been discussing.\nAnd I think where you might be hearing something is more on the timing and the wording of stuff.  The conclusions, everybody in the administration is agreed upon.  There is no daylight between anybody -- between the President, between any of the Secretaries.  I think there has been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations, or between the exact wording.\nBut as far as the conclusions go, I've made this clear and the President has made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer in states' rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level.\nQ    Sean, a report out today that some Cabinet Secretaries are bristling at what they see as the White House micromanaging staffing at the sub-Cabinet level.  To what degree does the White House think that it should impose its hiring approvals on members of the sub-Cabinet?  And is some of this at least partially driven by Cabinet Secretaries wanting to appoint people who might not necessarily be aligned with the President's thinking?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I mean, I think when you come to -- they're called political appointees for a reason.  The idea is that people who come into this government should want to support and enact the President's agenda that he campaigned on with the American people.  And I think one of the reasons that you see in recent polls the President -- people, even if they don't agree with the President, they give him high marks for following through on the promises that he's made to the American people and getting things done that he actually said, which is not always the case here in Washington.\nAnd I think that we want to make sure that the people who staff a Trump administration are committed to a Trump agenda, and that's -- so Cabinet Secretaries and other administrators and directors have broad discretion.  But I think at the end of the day, no matter what position you have -- whether it's the lowest or the highest in the White House or in a department or agency -- we should be making sure that people who are coming in as appointees of the President support the President's agenda.  And I think that's one thing -- this isn't about getting a job as a federal employee where you're subject to certain restrictions as to what you can and can't do as a benefit of being a federal employee.  These are political appointees, and so I think that there is obviously -- we are going to ensure that people who are political appointees share the vision and agenda that the President campaigned on and is implementing.\nQ    And does the White House believe that it needs to have the final approval of these people or can you trust your Cabinet Secretaries to --\nMR. SPICER:  It's not a question of trust.  It's a question of just making sure that we're all on the same page and committed to the same agenda that the President has set forth.  This process is probably no different than we've seen in previous administrations.  Cabinet Secretaries come to the President with recommendations on who they want, and it depends on the position, obviously.\nBut in certain cases, if they're going to fulfill a job that is a key area that the President had very specific goals to enact that he promised the American people, you want to make sure that the person that is fulfilling that job actually is committed to the agenda and the vision that the President set forth and promised the American people.  And that's -- so there is -- that's something that we're always going to be making sure is in alignment.\nQ    And is this approval process in some way slowing down the appointment of crucial staffers?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  No, not at all.  I don't think so.  I think when you look across where we are and we track the number of folks that are in the pipeline, we're doing very, very well with getting all of these positions filled.  And I think once in a while, you might hear of one or two people, but overall, generally speaking, I mentioned during the transition period how many members of the beachhead teams that we had, and I think we -- those members who are appointed through the beachhead process had 120 days.  And they were there to allow basically a four-month process for Secretaries in the White House to make sure that people on a permanent basis could populate those positions.  And that's what's happening.\nBut make no mistake -- I mean, we were ahead of the curve on the beachhead teams.  We were very clear with the landing teams during the transition.  This has been a very methodical process that has seen from top to bottom through, and I think we're doing a phenomenal job of staffing the government.\nMargaret.\nQ    Thank you.  Oh, which Margaret?\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, lucky me.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Two Margarets.  I'm going to take mine -- I've got a Bloomberg-y question for you.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  I've got a Sean-y answer for you.  (Laughter.)\nQ    The President in the Roosevelt Room just said to us that, among other things, that the tax plan is nearly finalized but it can't be submitted until the healthcare plan statutorily or otherwise is, so we're doing the healthcare.  So what I wanted to clarify was, is the White House doing a healthcare proposal, or was he talking about Congress and not the White House?  Or is there a new plan?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, obviously -- right.  So obviously there's two vehicles -- reconciliation vehicles that -- FY17 -- I'm going to give you a Bloomberg-y answer.  (Laughter.)  The FY17 reconciliation, that was never completed because the budget wasn't finalized in the last Congress.  And then you’ve got the 2018.  I think we want to make sure -- look at the opportunities to work with Congress on Obamacare, utilizing the 2017, and then you could utilize the 2018 reconciliation and budget process to do tax reform.\nThat’s not -- and again, that’s not prescriptive.  I’m not -- but as far as why the President is saying it that way is because we’ve got that option available to us right now, and I think the President is committed to making sure that the promise that he made to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare continues to be first and foremost, and then his tax plan.\nBut it’s not a “we can walk and chew gum” kind of thing.  We can actually be continuting to work with Congress and the leadership in both Houses.\nQ    President Obama used to say that.  Just to do the Bloomberg-y timeline, there’s a few things that are going to happen then.  There’s going to be a budget plan that you guys are going to present on March 13th-ish.\nMR. SPICER:  Ish.  (Laughter.)\nQ    There’s going to be a healthcare -- this is where I got lost again -- something from him and something from them, and a tax reform plan afterwards?  Is that the way it works?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t want -- look, when we’re ready to announce stuff -- but I think again, I think you’ve got Obamacare, the budget, and tax reform.  It’s going to be a very busy March and April for us.  And we’ve been continuing to work with Congress to make sure that that’s implemented.\nNoah Bierman.\nQ    Does the President -- you were talking about fulfilling his promises.  As you know, he promised during the campaign a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country.  There were a lot of people in his party who thought that was a very good proposal.  Can you explain his evolution in backing down from that?  And can you also say whether he regrets using that rhetoric, since it ended up hurting the court case?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I’d go back to the merits of the case and the order that gives him the authority to make that.  U.S. Code 1182 is very clear.  The President was very clear in his executive order that these were countries that we didn’t have the proper vetting for when it came to ensuring the safety of Americans.\nThat’s what the executive order said.  The authority is very clear to have done it.  And I think that you’re going to continue to see the President take the steps necessary to protect this country.  That’s why he’s talked about fighting this on both fronts, making sure that we keep evolving through the court system on the existing EO, and then looking towards the next draft of the executive order that will continue to achieve the goal of protecting the American people.\nSo that’s where we are.  That’s what the order says.  And then so I think we continue to feel confident that that’s -- but it was crafted in a way that was very clear about the countries, and was not focused on anything else but the vetting requirements that we have to make sure that we know who’s coming into this country and that they’re here not to do us any harm.\nQ    But when talking about fulfilling his promises, can you explain why he decided to back down from that one?  Because I know you differentiated this from that promise.\nMR. SPICER:  I think he’s made it very clear, Noah, from the beginning that this was a country-focused issue, a safety-focused issue, and that’s why he issued it.  I don’t see anything other than that with reference to that.\nDebra Saunders.\nQ    Hi.  The Oscars are Sunday night.  Will the President be watching?  If there’s a Meryl Streep kind of moment, how do you think he’ll react?  And why -- if this has happened at other awards ceremonies, why do you think this happens?\nMR. SPICER:  Why do I think what happens?  (Laughter.)\nQ    Actresses and actors like Meryl Streep.\nMR. SPICER:  I have no idea.  It’s a free country.  I think Hollywood is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions.  And I’ve got to be honest with you, I think the President will be hosting the Governors Ball that night.  Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal event, and the First Lady has put a lot of time into this event that’s going to occur in welcoming our nation’s governors to the Capitol.  And I have a feeling that that’s where the President and the First Lady are going to be focused on on Sunday night, and so we’ll go from there.\nQ    Sean, the President is going to have a big audience next Tuesday in the joint address to Congress.  Does he have a set of goals in mind for the speech?  And do you think we’re going to see some specific policy rollouts as part of that speech?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that the speech is going to focus -- I mentioned this yesterday -- I think it’s going to talk -- remind the American people what he’s done already, and make sure that he explains to them not just because of a sense of accomplishment in moving this country forward, but because I think it’s important for the American people to know that he was an agent of change, he came here to get things done, and he didn’t waste any time.\nHe’s committed to keeping his word.  And then I think he’s going to lay out his vision and talk about things like education and healthcare and infrastructure, the problems that we face as a country, the violence in some of our inner cities, but also some of the solutions that we can act on and some of the partnerships that we can create.  It’s obviously still a work in progress.\nBut I think it’s going to look forward to where he wants to take this country and talk about working with Congress and other leaders throughout the country to get things done.  But I think in the drafts that I’ve seen so far, it is going to be a very strong blueprint of where he wants to take this country.\nIn the past, I think a lot of presidents -- or some presidents, rather, have gotten into very detailed specifics.  I think you’re going to see him try to talk about policies in a broad sense of where he wants to take this country and what defining success is, what that goal means.  But it’s still a work in progress, and hopefully towards the end of the week --\nQ    Is the tone going to be optimistic, sunny?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think this is an opportunity for him to lay out a very positive vision for the nation and to really let America know where we can go and how we can get there, and the potential that we have as a nation.\nAnita.\nQ    Just piggybacking on that, and then I have another question.  Will he -- I know past presidents, including President Obama, immediately hit the road after -- I know this isn’t a State of the Union, but something like a State of the Union address to sell policies.  And since you’re saying it’s more of a vision, does he anticipate doing -- going out --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think there will be some travel.  I don't want to -- that's evolving right now.  There’s a lot of things that we're trying to look at.  And I think as we look at the speech and some of the objectives and goals and vision that he’s sharing, talk to him about potential places to go to highlight that.  But I think you're going to see a fair amount of visits in the next few weeks to highlight some of the places that he wants to take them.\nQ    And then the other thing was, I've seen -- some members of Congress were here last week.  There’s the legislative meeting today.  It feels as if we haven’t seen as many executive actions -- or executive orders.  I know we have the one -- vetting one coming out this week.  Are we in a different phase now that he’s sort of done the executive orders that he wants to do --\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    -- and we're going to legislation?\nMR. SPICER:  We have several that are in the pipeline.  And part of it is just -- these days are focused with these meetings and getting things done and trying to plan ahead.  And so as we see fit and as the implementation process of a lot of these goes through the process, we’ll have future -- we’ll have plenty more.  But --\nQ    It does seem that there's more legislative emphasis right now.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, it’s both.  And I think part of this is as we work through Congress, Anita, these are big things, right?  We're talking about fundamental tax reform -- something that hasn’t happened in our nation since 1986.  The repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which was mammoth.\nAnd I think part of this is that those things take time.  He’s got a joint address on Tuesday.  There’s a lot of things that are happening, and therefore we need to kind of make sure that we appropriately use the schedule.  But I can assure you that if you've missed executive orders, you're going to see a bunch --\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER:  (Laughter.)  I know.  I just want to make sure you know.\nJonathan Karl.\nQ    I want to ask you about the town halls, and we're hearing about Obamacare.  The President referred to “so-called angry crowds” at these town halls.  Is he suggesting this is manufactured anger, that this is not real anger and real concern?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks.  I think there’s a hybrid there.  I think some people are clearly upset.  But there is a bit of professional protestor, manufactured base in there.  But obviously there are people that are upset.  But I also think that when you look at some of these districts and some of these things, that it is not a representation of a member’s district or -- it is a loud group, small group of people disrupting something, in many cases, for media attention.  No offense.\nIt’s just -- I think that necessarily -- just because they're loud doesn't necessarily mean that there are many.  And I think in a lot of cases that's what you're seeing.\nQ    Does the President doubt that there is real anger --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I just said that.\nQ    -- and real concern out there beyond just a few loud agitators, that there’s real concern that people may lose their healthcare?\nMR. SPICER:  But see, I think that that's a false narrative.  And I don't -- the President has been very clear.  Look, you have to look at what our healthcare system is right now.  In so many counties around our nation, we've gone down to one provider.  That's not choice.  That's not access.\nAnd then they're going in a lot of cases and they're saying, we're not taking Medicaid, we're not taking TRICARE, we're not taking the insurance you used to have; the doctor that you used to have isn’t participating anymore.  And, oh, by the way, states like Arizona, you've got over 100 percent increase in premiums -- 112 [percent] I think was the number there.  In many states, it’s double, triple -- double-digit.\nAnd I think that the idea that we have to remember is that the American people got sold the Affordable Care Act -- it’s neither affordable or accessible.  They're losing their coverage and premiums are spiking.  And so if people are truly worried about losing their coverage, they should be applauding the President’s action for wanting to make sure that we put a system in place that does what they were supposed to have been promised a while back.\nAnd I think that's -- that's what I think is missing from this dialogue.  I’ve seen some folks that were protesting in some of these things saying, I lost -- I’m on Obamacare, I’m going to lose my thing.  And when they were asked how old they were, they were, oh, I’m 71, 72.  Well, they're not on Obamacare. -- they're on Medicaid.\nQ    So you think you're making it up?\nMR. SPICER:  No, not they're making it up.  But what I’m getting at it is I think that there is a lot of blurring of the facts.  And the reality is that some people aren’t on Obamacare.  They're on an employer-based system.  They're on Medicaid.  They're receiving their benefits through Medicare because of their age.  And so they're in -- nothing.  They have no problems.\nBut I think in other cases, people are now being told that the plan that they're on is unsustainable; that these carriers throughout the country -- I mean, you just look at them, over and over again pulling out of the exchanges.  The reality is, is that they are losing their healthcare, but they're losing it under Obamacare because the exchanges are collapsing on themselves.  Carriers are pulling out.  Premiums are going up.  And access is going down.\nSo the President's plan is actually going to do exactly what they were promised eight years ago and didn't get.  So for those who are worried, the answer is:  Help is on the way.\nQ    But what is the plan?  We haven't seen what he's going to replace it with.\nMR. SPICER:  First, as the President made clear, we're going to have that out in the next couple weeks.  He's working on it.  But the goal, Jonathan, is this got jammed through a Democratic Congress, and then they told us you could read it after we get it passed.  So taking our time, getting this right to achieve the goals that we set forth is probably the right thing to do, considering the experience that we had the last time.\nHallie.\nQ    Sean, two questions for you.  The issue of transgender bathrooms wasn't one we heard a lot about from the President during the campaign.  He said at one point, Caitlyn Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted to at Trump Tower.  So why is this now a priority for the administration 40 days into office?\nMR. SPICER:  It's not a priority.  I think there's a case --\nQ    But It's one of the first things --\nMR. SPICER:  But let me answer the question.  It's not a priority.  There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the Court.  It's dictated by that.\nThe Obama administration had issued joint guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  We now have to decide whether or not this administration wants to continue that track that they were on.  It's plain and simple.  If we don't -- but there are problems, both in the legal and process way, in which that guidance was issued.  And so it's incumbent upon us to actually follow the law and to recognize that Title IX never talked about this.  It was enacted in 1972.  There was no discussion of this back then.  And to assume certain elements of the law were thought of back then with respect to this would be completely preposterous.\nQ    And to be clear, Secretary DeVos is onboard with this?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes, 100 percent.  Thank you.\nQ    Sean, that was actually a clarification.  The second question is on Mexico.  The Secretary of State's trip that is tonight along with Secretary Kelly, obviously there have been tensions, right, between the Mexican President and President Trump.  Is this a clean-up job for the Secretary of State?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  I think that President Peña Nieto and President Trump spoke -- again, the foreign ministers had several contacts with our staff.  I would argue that we have a very healthy and robust relationship with the Mexican government and Mexican officials, and I think they would echo that same sentiment.  President Peña Nieto has echoed that as well.\nBut I think the relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now, and I think there's an unbelievable and robust dialogue between our two nations.\nMargaret, and then I'll get you.\nQ    On Syria, General Votel indicated today that the U.S. needs to take a larger share of the burden and perhaps send troops to Syria.  Has the President discussed this with his national security team?  And when does he --\nMR. SPICER:  I'm going to refer you back to DOD on that.  I would just argue that I think that you've seen the President talk about safe harbors in Syria with several foreign leaders who have shared his --\nQ    Safe havens.\nMR. SPICER:  Safe havens, thank you.  And that is an area at the top of the President's foreign policy agenda that he has continued to talk to leaders, especially in the Middle east, about, trying to make sure that we deal with that issue in that area right now.  But I'm not going to get ahead of the DOD on this.  And then when they have recommendations, they'll make them forward to us.\nQ    Is there an NSC -- has the President spoken to --\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I will -- if I have an update, I'll give it to you tomorrow.\nGo ahead.\nQ    President Trump and the Canadian Prime Minister launched the U.S. and Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs.  Can you talk a little bit about how the council is growing and transpiring?  What's the status of it?\nMR. SPICER:  I think staff is beginning to implement the President's agenda.  It occurred, what, six, seven days ago.  And so it's starting to work through the process and we'll have further updates as it goes forward.  But I know that he continues to be in touch with Prime Minister Trudeau, and our staff continues to work on the back end to make this happen.\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  I have two questions for you.  One, earlier in your conversation with Jon, does the White House not have confidence in its Cabinet Secretaries if it's looking sort of over their shoulders?  Does the White House not -- does the President not trust his Cabinet Secretaries, appointees and agency administrators to staff -- to find people who agree with the President's agenda?\nMR. SPICER:  No, not at all.  I think there's a big difference.  The President named these folks because they're unbelievably qualified individuals.  Part of it, though, is that you're staffing major departments and I think we've got somewhere in the area of 5,000 positions to fill.  And when you're filtering through a good number of people, I don't even think the Secretaries, at some degree, depending on the department, have a full background on some of these individuals.\nAnd so as they get pumped through the pipeline, there are questions.  And, again, there are areas that are of key priority to the President that he campaigned on.  And I think that when he wants to make sure that certain of those individuals who are going to be overseeing key priorities that he promised the American people have somebody who is not only qualified but agrees with and shares the President's vision to fix whatever problem that was or fulfill whatever vision that he articulated.\nBut I think that that -- I mean, it would almost be malpractice not to do that.  To allow people to fill a job, a political appointee job, who don't share the vision and agenda of the President of the United States would almost be -- I mean, it would be silly on its face to suggest this.\nI don't think there's any administration in past history that would literally, willingly, take on somebody who was adamantly opposed or spoke out specifically against what the President was seeking to do, and then have them fulfill a job to carry out that mission.  It just -- it doesn't seem as though it makes any sense.\nYes.\nQ    Second thing real quick.  We're coming up on a week away from the deadline the President ordered for his review of the counter-ISIS strategy.  What’s the status of that review?  The President tweeted over the weekend that he was meeting with a bunch of generals.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    Is that regarding that review?\nMR. SPICER:  I think General Dunford and Secretary Mattis have begun providing him updates on that.  I know that the new National Security Advisor is getting brought into that process and continuing to do updates, so we’ll have further updates.  But the team has been working on it since the President issued the guidance.\nYes.\nQ    As far as the second executive order is concerned, what is the White House doing differently in terms of consulting with various departments to make certain that this second executive order passes constitutional scrutiny?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think we've done a few things.  One is, I think we've been very clear about understanding what the court said in trying to tailor that specifically while achieving the same goals of keeping America safe and ensuring that people don't come into this country that seek to do us harm.  That's number one.\nNumber two is, we continue -- and that order is basically completed.  I think what we're now doing is working with the various agencies and departments to make sure that the implementation of that is done in an extremely smooth way.  So we have looked at it from both a process standpoint, as well as a legal standpoint.  And I think it’s achieving the goals.\nBut again, I would also mention that, on the merits, I believe that the first order did just that.  It was written in a way -- and I think ultimately we will continue to prevail on that -- because it is written in a way that is clear and consistent with U.S. code and the authority that the President has to protect the nation.\nKatie.\nQ    Sean --\nQ    No matter what happens, as it relates to the second executive order, it’s almost likely to face a legal challenge.\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    Are you concerned that the President’s prior remarks as it relates to the judiciary is going to allow him to get a fair hearing by the judicial branch as it relates to the second executive order?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, absolutely.  I think that --\nQ    Why do you say that?\nMR. SPICER:  Because I think that you've seen it happen in the Massachusetts case.  I mean, at the end of the day, you look at the law and what the order does.  And I think, again, you may have -- in the case of the 9th Circuit, we continue to disagree with that.  I think the President has pointed out you don't have to be that high up in grade school to recognize what the code says, what the authority that is granted to him, and then what the order does.\nI think the things that they brought out in that order -- in one of the cases, they suggested there have been no people that have entered within the seven countries.  And a quick cursory look found upwards of close to 20 people that had come in.  So some of the basis for which they decided the case on doesn't actually pass muster.  And I think any other judge or judges that look at that order or the one that will be put forward will come to the same conclusion.\nKatie.\nQ    Sean, I wanted to ask about the President’s budget priorities.  What specifically is the President increasing spending on?  Where is he decreasing spending?  And how much money specifically is he asking for the 5,000 new Border Patrol agents he’s asked for?\nMR. SPICER:  So I’m going to refer you back to Margaret’s question, and then we’ll have something in mid-March as we put that out.  But I’m not going to get ahead of Director Mulvaney.\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER:  No, I mean, it’s not -- look, he just had a meeting where he’s continued to work that out.  They're providing him back-and-forth.  That's the idea of crafting this budget.  And until we put it out on paper, I don't want to get ahead of --\nQ    Sean, can I follow up on Mexico?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    Thank you very much.  Back to Mexico -- Videgaray and many officials have said this morning that they're not going to accept the directives that were put out by the White House and by DHS yesterday, and they may not take anyone that's not a Mexican immigrant.  What are you guys doing to do with those people that Mexico will not accept?\nMR. SPICER:  I think Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are going to have a great discussion down there, and to walk through the implementation of the executive order.  But I feel very confident that any country who has a citizen that comes into this country, and that we send back, we’ll make sure that they comply with this.\nDavid.\nQ    Two questions about immigration.  One, the President has talked a number of times about millions of illegal immigrants casting votes during the election, in his mind.  You guys have promised to look into that.  It seems like there was no mention of that in any of these directives, to look for these immigrants.  Does the President still believe this is a national security problem?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, and Vice President Pence will lead a task force on this.\nQ    Where would we stand on that, though?\nMR. SPICER:  He named a task force, and the Vice President is starting to gather names and individuals to be part of it.\nQ    On the other question I had about the DACA program, yesterday you suggested, well, we have to go after hardened criminals and major national security threats first.  But during the campaign, the President talked about DACA as being an unconstitutional executive amnesty.  Does he still think it was an unconstitutional use of President Obama’s powers?  And if so, does he plan --\nMR. SPICER:  I think -- yeah, I think -- and I said this yesterday:  The President is very clear about his priorities with respect to immigration.  Yesterday was focused on going after people who are a concern -- a public safety concern.  And we're going to walk through this very --\nQ    -- unconstitutional?\nMR. SPICER:  We will get back to you on that.  Right now the focus is on keeping the country safe and making sure that we walk through.\nShane.\nQ    I want to ask on immigration, as well.  Given all of the push on deporting illegal immigrants, I wanted to see if this White House and President Trump have any interest in curtailing legal immigration going forward.\nMR. SPICER:  Again, we got to look at this from a priority level.  Right now there’s millions of people in this country that are in the country illegally.  I think the focus continues to be that 800,000 or 900,000 that have already had an order to have them removed and get them processed through in a way that continues to keep America safe.\nLegal immigration, obviously, is a completely separate subject, and that includes visa reform and all that other stuff.  The President has talked about that.  He’s talked about it with business leaders -- H-1B visas, et cetera.  You're going to see more of that coming.  But I think there is a prioritization of how we deal with immigration -- both illegal and then legal.  And we’ll have more on that later.\nI got to run.  Thank you, guys, very much.  We’ll see you tomorrow.  Take care.\nEND\n1:30 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:42 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Hey, good afternoon, everyone.  It's been a little while.  Hope you missed me.  (Laughter.)\nQ    You missed us?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  We’ve got a lot to talk about today, so let’s get right to it.\nFirst off, I want to acknowledge the tragic plane crash that occurred in Australia that took the lives of five individuals, including four Americans.  The President’s thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, and the U.S. embassy and consulate are ready to provide necessary and appropriate assistance.\nMoving on, the President was honored to announce that Lieutenant General McMaster will be his National Security Advisor.  General McMaster served this nation in the United States Army for over three decades, including during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Desert Storm.\nThe President met with many distinguished and qualified candidates for the position, and as he has said that he will continue to consider many of them for other positions within the administration.  He is especially pleased that Lieutenant General Kellogg will stay on as the National Security Council Chief of Staff.\nThe President is proud to welcome General McMaster to the team where he will have full authority to structure the office to his desires to best serve its ultimate mission, which is to protect the American interests at home and abroad.\nThis morning, Secretary Kelly and the Department of Homeland Security released memos regarding the implementation of two of the President’s executive orders that are designed to protect the homeland.  These two memos provide explicit guidance to DHS staff on how to carry out two executive orders signed by the President on January 25th -- one dealing with interior enforcement and one dealing with border security.  Perhaps most critically, the President is empowering DHS to carry out the immigration laws currently on the books.\nOf course, DHS gave a full briefing on these memos this morning, but just to briefly summarize a few of the facts:  The memo regarding the executive order “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” outlines several practices and policies in order to strengthen the efficient and faithful execution of this country’s immigration laws.  That includes hiring more ICE agents and officers, as well as additional mission support and legal staff necessary to support their activities.  This memo also directs the establishment of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within ICE, fulfilling another major campaign promise of the President.  This office will facilitate the engagement with victims and their families to ensure that their questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed.\nThe memo regarding the executive order “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements” outlines the steps that DHS will take to secure the nation’s southern border, prevent further illegal immigration, and to repatriate illegal immigrants swiftly, consistently, and humanely.  This includes immediately identifying and allocating all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall along our southern border and hiring of additional personnel, including 5,000 additional CBP border agents.\nAgain, I would refer you to DHS for further comment on these specific memos.  There are factsheets and Q&As on the DHS website that address many of the intricacies in areas within each of these executive orders that you might have questions on.\nAlso, this weekend, the President had calls with the President of Panama and the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago.  Readouts of those calls have both been provided.\nThe President’s team this weekend also had a very productive meeting on the President’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and ensure that it is replaced with a system that works for all Americans.\nBack to the President’s schedule today, in honor of Black History Month, the President started his day by visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture.  The museum opened last September and has quickly become one of Washington’s most-visited attractions.\nThe President was joined by a group of individuals that included his daughter, Ivanka; Dr. Ben Carson and his wife; Senator Tim Scott;\nAlveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; museum director Lonnie Bunch; Dr. David Skorton, who is the Secretary of the Smithsonian, as well as others.\nThe President commented several times during his tour about how impressed he was with the museum.  Some of the exhibits that he was particularly drawn to included the section on Harriet Tubman, which featured a shawl that was given to her by Queen Victoria in the late 1800s; the section of the museum that featured the courageous contribution of African Americans that have made to the United States military.  And the President was particularly pleased by the Muhammad Ali exhibit with the quote, “I shook up the world” prominently displayed.\nThe President also enjoyed viewing for the first time with Dr. and Mrs. Carson the exhibit dedicated to his extraordinary life.  Similarly, Alveda King, who had never viewed the museum’s exhibit on her uncle, the President was honored that he was able to share this experience with the two of them specifically.\nThe President further expressed his appreciation for the tour, and said he looks forward to returning again.  His desire is to honor the immense contributions of courageous African American leaders throughout our history by building a more unified country, dedicated to liberty and justice.\nThis afternoon, the President will have a routine, classified National Security Council briefing in the Situation Room, in addition to his Presidential Daily Briefing, which he received earlier this morning.\nThen, this evening the President will have dinner with Vice President Pence.  I’m sure that they will discuss the Vice President's recent trip to Europe.  The Vice President was an incredible representative for our nation and the President during his time, where he reiterated our support for our European allies in unified pursuit of the noble ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice, and the rule of law and discussing how to do more to encourage all NATO allies to meet their financial obligations and commitments.\nDuring his speech before the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, the Vice President conveyed the administration’s unwavering commitment to Europe’s peace and prosperity, especially remembering the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives to defend those ideals during both World War I and II.  These shared sacrifices are the backbone of our alliance and our mission of security through strength.\nDuring his time in Munich, the Vice President also met with nine world leaders.  The Vice President and these leaders discussed the issues most pressing to them, including the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine and the role of NATO in the fight against ISIS.  The Vice President also met in Brussels with President of Tusk -- Vice President Tusk of the Council of the European Union and NATO Secretary -- the NATO Secretary General.\nAs a candidate for office, President Trump actually called attention repeatedly to the fact that for too long, many of our NATO allies have not been sharing the financial burden.  The President looks forward to working closely with NATO to advance our shared objectives.  A strong NATO means a safer world.  And the United States looks forward to working with our partners in NATO to achieve just that.\nLooking ahead to the President’s upcoming schedule -- tomorrow, he will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson, fresh off his trip to Germany for the G20 Foreign Ministers Summit.  They'll discuss the President’s foreign policy agenda and the Secretary’s upcoming trip to Mexico.\nThursday morning, he'll have a listening session regarding job creation in the manufacturing sector with CEOs and business leaders from different industries.\nOn Friday, he'll deliver remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference.  And we are just one week out today from the President’s Joint Address to Congress.\nThe President will continue to work closely with his team to craft a speech that lays out his ambitious policy agenda that will benefit all Americans.  Plans are currently in the works for pre- and post-address activities for the President and his staff.  And we'll have more updates as the week goes on.\nBefore I take your questions, I want to address the recent threats and acts of vandalism on Jewish community centers throughout the country.  The President said this morning -- I just want to reiterate -- \"The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community centers are horrible and painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that we must do\" -- excuse me -- \"the work that must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.\"\nWith that, I’ll take some of your questions.  Jim Stinson.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  I was curious if the President regrets or wants to clarify his characterization -- by the way, I have two questions -- of the media as an \"enemy of the American people.\"\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President has been very clear that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not represent his record accurately, and it is a concern to him.\nAnd I think some reporters -- he has deep respect for the First Amendment, for the role of the press -- I’ve addressed this multiple times in the past.  He has a healthy respect for the press.  But I think that it’s a two-way street, as I’ve also said before, and I think that the President understands that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not be completely accurate and fair in their coverage of what’s going on.\nQ    Speaking of the media, I’ve noticed two times in the last week that you’ve been directly contradicted by two members of the media, one of them Bill Maher of HBO, who said that in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago, the President was briefed on the classified North Korean situation.\nMR. SPICER:  Say that again, I’m sorry.\nQ    The President and the Prime Minister of Japan were briefed in front of guests --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I didn’t say that.\nQ    No, no, no, this is what was being said on HBO, that the President and the Prime Minister were briefed on classified information in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago.  I just want to clarify, did that happen?  Did they --\nMR. SPICER:  No.  No.  I think I walked through this timeline before, Jim.  And it’s amazing -- a photo gets put out, the President has got a piece of paper, and the immediate conclusion is he’s got to be talking about classified information.\nThe President was briefed on the situation in North Korea prior to the dinner, in a SCIF, that’s at Mar-a-Lago.  He went and had dinner.  He discussed the logistics of the press conference, which I’ve talked to you all before -- there was a question as to where to hold the press conference.  They had a discussion about the logistics of it.  And subsequent to that dinner, he was briefed again in a SCIF with updates on the situation in North Korea.  That’s it, plain and simple.\nBut to your first question, I think that it’s amazing that the immediate jump of conclusion to several outlets was, well, there’s a piece of paper, it must be classified.  I don’t -- it’s amazing to see that and to see people jump to that conclusion that he’s surrounded by his staff and members of the Japanese delegation, the conclusion is they must be doing something nefarious or wrong.  In fact, he followed every procedure that’s laid out.\nAnd I think in some cases, it’s disheartening to realize that those are the kind of immediate conclusions that somebody jumps to.  So when you talk about coverage, we have a free press.  We have the right for people to say and do what they believe.  But at some point, it is incumbent upon people to try to get it right.  And in that case, it wasn’t even attempted.  It was a jump to conclusion by many to say that there must be something else going on when, in fact, we were able to provide a very, very clear tick-tock as to what had happened in that.\nJessica.\nQ    Sean, a question about the resignation of 10 people on the Asian American Council.  That happened last week.  And in the letter, they said in part, “We can no longer serve a President whose policies aim to create outcomes that are diametrically opposite to our principles, goals and charge.”  First of all, what’s the White House’s reaction?  And do you plan to appoint your own members to this council?\nMR. SPICER:  Those members of that council were political appointees of the Obama administration.  Their terms were set to expire this year.  So it’s not surprising in the sense that they were appointees of Barack Obama.  They were going to have their terms expire.\nQ    But in terms of --\nBut again, but -- I get it, but most political appointees from other agencies or whatever would automatically resign because of the term of these individuals, they would carry through until later in the year.  But I don’t think it’s surprising that people who were appointed by Barack Obama to fulfill his agenda suddenly understand that there is a new administration in town and didn’t want to stay on board.\nBut we will make sure that we appoint people to this task force.  It’s important.  It’s something that’s provided guidance to multiple presidents in the past, and we will continue to do that.\nShannon.\nQ    On the statement today about the anti-Semitic acts, what specifically is the President going to do to address that issue?  And, along those lines, there were reports earlier on that he was considering changing the mandate of this countering violent extremism program to focus just on Islamic extremist groups.  Is he still considering that, or would he also leave the scope of the program to also consider --\nMR. SPICER:  Are you talking about the travel executive order?\nQ    No, no, no, this is the countering violent extremism program that --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves there.  There’s nothing to announce on that front.  And secondly, to the first part of your question, I think the President is going to do what he’s talked about since election night.  It’s through deed and action, talk about how we can unify this country and speak out against hate, anti-Semitism, racism.  And he’s going to continue to do that.\nAnd I think that he will show you over the course of months and years, through what he does in terms of his policies and his speech, that he is going to be a President that brings people together, that unites them, and that speaks very, very forcefully against those who are seeking to do hate or to tear people down because of their religion or their gender or the color of their skin.  I mean, those are all things that I think the President was clear on.\nJohn.\nQ    Two questions unrelated, if I could.  The next big piece in the immigration profile here at the White House is going to be the new executive order.  Is the President confident that this one will pass legal muster?  And if he is, what gives him that confidence?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think -- first, I want to be clear that we feel confident that we’re still going to prevail on the case -- the merits of the case.  I think that as was seen in the case of Massachusetts, once it is fully adjudicated, we will prevail because the authority is granted to the President to do what he has to, to protect the country.  So I feel very, very confident about where we're going to go.\nThe second track that he's made very clear as well is that until that occurs, we're going to have a dual-track system.  And then we're going to make sure that we implement a second executive order that is tailored to achieve the same goals but in accordance with what the court said.  So we've been working very closely with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the team here at the White House to make sure that the next step achieves the President's goal of protecting the country and does so in a way that recognizes the concerns that the court had until we prevail at a later time.  So it's a dual-track thing.\nQ    Will this administration send American terror suspects picked up overseas to Guantanamo Bay for interrogation or prosecution?\nMR. SPICER:  I am not going to discuss that right now.  As the President has said very clearly before, we don't telegraph what we're going to do.  I think he has made very clear, though, that he believes that Guantanamo Bay does serve a very, very healthy purpose in our national security in making sure that we don't bring terrorists to our seas.  But I'm not going to get into what we may or may not do in the future.\nQ    Including American citizens?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I'm just not going to --\nQ    Sean, I want to give you a chance to respond to something because I think the President's remarks and your clarification about where he stands on anti-Semitism is clear.  But after that statement was made by the President, The Anne Frank Center released a pretty strongly worded one, saying that these remarks, while well-received, are a Band-Aid on the cancer within the Trump administration, saying that there is, whether blessed or otherwise, a sense of xenophobia within this administration.  What do you think about that?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, the President has made clear since the day he was elected and, frankly, going back through the campaign, that he is someone who seeks to unite this country.  He has brought a diverse group of folks into his administration, both in terms of actual positions and people that he has sought the advice of.  And I think he has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their hate -- excuse me, because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin.  And it is something that he is going to continue to fight and make very, very clear that he has no place in this administration.\nBut I think that it's ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, that it's never good enough.  Today I think was an unbelievably forceful comment by the President as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted towards Jewish community centers, but I think that he's been very clear previous to this that he wants to be someone that brings this country together and not divide people, especially in those areas.\nSo I saw that statement.  I wish that they had praised the President for his leadership in this area.  And I think that hopefully, as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans.\nQ    Sean, on that, the southern part of --\nMR. SPICER:  We started early with the two questions.\nQ    Sorry.  Sean, Southern Poverty -- I think you'll want to respond to this.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.\nQ    Southern Poverty Law Center said that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S. has tripled between 2015 and 2016, during the time of the campaign.  Is this message within the administration -- anti-Semitism is not allowed, xenophobia is not allowed -- anti-Muslim sentiment within the administration, has the President been forceful about that particular issue?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that the President, in terms of his desire to combat radical Islamic terrorism, he understands that people who want to express a peaceful position have every right in our Constitution.  But if you come here or want to express views that seek to do our country or our people harm, he is going to fight it aggressively, whether it's domestic acts that are going on here or attempts through people abroad to come into this country.  So there's a big difference between preventing attacks and making sure that we keep this country safe so that there is no loss of life in allowing people to express themselves in accordance with our First Amendment.  Those are two very, very different, different, different things.\nQ    Sean, you talked about how the manufacturing -- I didn't know where you were going.\nMR. SPICER:  I was (inaudible) in the back.  (Laughter.)\nQ    I saw the manufacturing CEOs are coming on Thursday, so let me ask you something that's important to them, which is the border adjustment tax.   The President earlier this year called it \"too complicated.\"  Does he still feel that way?  And whether he feels this is complicated or not, is there something within the administration one way or another about whether the President, the administration wants to see this in or out of the tax package?\nMR. SPICER:  So there’s several pieces to that that I’ll try to unpack.  That counts as, like, eight questions.\nQ    Does he feel it’s complicated, and what’s your preference?\nMR. SPICER:  So, first of all, on the meeting on Thursday, this is going to be a really historic opportunity for CEOs to come in and talk to members of the White House staff and others through various agencies about how we can create jobs, how regulations are stifling economic growth.  And I think we’ll have further details on that, but this is going to be a real interesting opportunity to really create a dialogue I think in a manner that hasn’t been done before -- but I’m not going to get ahead of myself on this -- where we can really discuss some of the inhibitors to job creation, job retraining, what do we need for American workers to get them ahead of the curve.\nWith respect to specific policy positions, I think the President has been very clear that in the next couple weeks we expect to have a tax plan that gets out there.  That is being worked on continuously.  And so I’m not going to get in front of that.  While the CEOs are here, I’m sure beyond some of these things, that’s an opportunity for them to express what some of those policies are that are both helping them create jobs and grow the economy, and also inhibiting them.  So let’s let that conversation play out.\nYes.\nQ    Okay, thank you, Sean.  My name is Raquel (ph) from TV Global News (ph) Brazil.  And I have a question.  There are doubts in Brazil right now about what’s going to happen to the relationship between the two countries with the new administration, especially related to immigration and also to trade deals.  Does President Trump also plan to review policies -- bilateral policies with Brazil in trade deals?  And also, my second question, how does the administration see the current turmoil -- economical and political turmoil in Brazil?\nAnd one more question, if I might.  (Laughter.)  President Trump spoke with some foreign leaders from South America, like Argentina, Colombia and Peru, but not -- it was the Vice President that spoke with President Temer from Brazil.  Why is that?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, obviously, we cherish our relationship with Brazil.  I think there’s a timing factor here and I think we’ll look forward to speaking with the President soon.  So I wouldn’t read too much into that right now.  It’s just a matter of getting things on the schedule.\nWe’re going to review all the trade deals that are out there.  The President has made very clear some of them have occurred well into a decade, two decades ago.  I think the idea is to make sure that we are looking at all of the trade deals we have throughout the globe to make sure that they continue to benefit America and American workers.    And in many cases, we can update these deals.\nSo it’s not any one particular country.  I think that we’re going to look throughout the whole host of trade agreements, and then other trade-related agreements that we have with countries to make sure that they are the most up-to-date and they address the technological advances that have occurred, and look at the various services -- whether it’s financial services or manufacturing -- and that they reflect the current state of play.\nSo this isn’t any one country.  I think the President made clear throughout the campaign and subsequent that he wants to review every trade deal to make sure that America and American workers are maintaining the best deal possible.\nCorbett (ph).  Oh, I’m sorry.\nQ    And on the turmoil, how does the administration see the turmoil in Brazil now?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to -- I think that’s a question for the Department of State right now.\nCorbett, yeah.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Two questions for you.  One on the NSC meeting later this afternoon.  Is that the first meeting of the National Security Council of the President with all the principals there?\nMR. SPICER:  No, that is just a routine briefing.  But because of the nature of it, it’s happening in the Situation Room.\nQ    But is that with staff, or is that with --\nMR. SPICER:  Staff.\nQ    Okay, so it’s not with, like, the principals committee.\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    When do you anticipate the first formal meeting of the National Security Council?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think General McMaster got here at noon today, so -- (laughter) -- we move fast, but I think that we need to give him a few days probably to get his team together.\nSo the President was obviously very pleased with the selection.  I think when you saw the bipartisan support that General McMaster received from the variety of the political spectrum -- people who have served Republicans and Democrats, academics, pundits, columnists -- you know that he made an outstanding choice.  We want to get him in, show him around the office a little bit, and then get him going.\nBut when we have a date to announce the next meeting, we’ll let you know.\nQ    The joint address for next week, what’s the President’s goal for that address?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that -- I’ll have a further update as the week goes on, and we’ll have briefings.  The President is going to lay out I think two main things -- where we’ve come and where we’re going.  I think that he is very pleased with the progress that he has made so far in the first month in office, and I think it’s an opportunity to remind members of Congress and the American people what he promised them on the campaign trail, what he’s done already in a very significant way to achieve and fulfill those promises that he made, but also talk about the challenges that we have as a nation and where we’re going.  And that’s everything from our relationship with other countries in this world to some of the various domestic problems that we face, the challenges that we face in cities, health care, education.\nBut the President wants to make sure that the American people have a very clear indication as to where he’s taking this country and why he’s going to enact the policies he’s going to enact.\nJohn.  George, I’m sorry.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Let me ask you a question about the Vice President’s European trip.  I’m curious whether he received any commitments from our European allies to commit more in terms of their financial contribution to NATO.\nMR. SPICER:  I think several of them -- I saw Chancellor Merkel’s comments previous to that, noting that they understand that the U.S. is asking for that commitment.\nLook, we’re one of the only countries -- there’s a handful -- that are doing what NATO requires, which is 2 percent of GDP.  Some of them are at 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and some of them are below that.  But we’ve got to ask them to do what they agreed to do.  And I think we’ve had a very positive reaction from most of these NATO countries that understand that the financial agreement that they agreed to is something that they need to live up to.\nAnd I think the Vice President continued to receive assurances, much like the President has through his foreign leader calls, where people not only understand it but are willing to follow through on it.\nQ    So it’s an ongoing process, or --\nMR. SPICER:  Of course it’s an ongoing -- I mean, I think we need to follow up to make sure that the commitments that they’re making on the phone or in person, in the case of the Vice President, are followed up.\nDave.\nQ    Sean, thanks.  The DHS memos today -- obviously these immigration enforcement efforts cost money, hiring more agents.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    Do you envision that the current budget is sufficient, or are you going to need to go to Congress for more money?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think right now ICE and DHS in particular, as well as CBP, are looking at what this is going to cost and how much and putting a request together, and then figuring out how much can be handled through reallocation of resources and how much we can save maybe in another area, but then also work with Congress.\nQ    One other subject, different matter.  There was an election report out today that the President raised more small campaign donations in 2016 than either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders combined.  Did he have a reaction to that?  Has he seen that?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know, and I would ask you to probably go through the RNC for that.  That’s a political matter that we generally don’t discuss.\nYeah.\nQ    Sean, the National Center for Transgender Equality, citing reliable sources, says the Trump administration today will rescind Obama-era guidance requiring schools to allow transgender kids to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity.  Will the Trump administration rescind that guidance?\nMR. SPICER:  Right now that’s an issue that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are addressing.  I would tell you that -- and I think that there will be further guidance coming from DOJ in particular with respect to not just the executive order, but also the case that’s in front of the Supreme Court.\nThe President has maintained for a long time that this is a states' rights issue and not one for the federal government.  So while there will be further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the President’s view has been for a long time -- that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in; this is a states' rights issue.\nMatt.\nQ    In the wake of the Vice President’s trip to Europe, there’s questions as to the administration’s position on the future of the European Union with regard to a number of political movements across the continent advocating for the disbandment eventually of the European Union.  I wanted to see if you could clarity the administration’s position on the future of the European Union.\nMR. SPICER:  I think the Vice President had great meetings with several European Union leaders and made it very clear to them that we’ll continue to work with them, and reaffirmed our commitment to working with these nations.  I mean, there’s no update on that.\nCecilia.\nQ    Thank you.  On immigration, on the DHS memo, two parts, if I may.  Is one of the goals here mass deportation?\nMR. SPICER:  No, not at all.  This isn’t -- look, I think what we have to get back to is understanding a couple things.  There’s a law in place that says if you’re in this country illegally, that we have an obligation to make sure that the people who are in our country are here legally.  What the order sets out today is ensures that the million-or-so people that have been adjudicated already, that ICE prioritizes, creates a system of prioritization, and makes sure that we walk through that system in a way that protects this country.\nThis is consistent with everything the President has talked about, which is prioritizing the people who are here who represent a threat to public safety or have a criminal record.  And all this does is lay out the exact procedures to make sure that that subgroup of people who pose a threat to our nation because of a conviction or a violation of public safety or have a criminal record are adjudicated first and foremost.  That's it, plain and simple.\nQ    So is then -- a follow-up to that.  Is the White House's message to date to undocumented people in this country whose only crime is being in this country illegally, \"Don't worry, or you're on notice\"?\nMR. SPICER:  No, the message from this White House and from the DHS is that those people who are in this country and pose a threat to our public safety or have committed a crime will be the first to go and we will be aggressively making sure that that occurs.  That is what the priority is.\nQ    What about the others who aren't?  They're watching this fearful right now.\nMR. SPICER:  Cecilia, the President has said multiple times that we've got to look at this issue on a very, very holistic way.  And the number-one priority when you look at the scope of how many people are in the country illegally, the number-one priority is making sure that people who pose a threat to this country are immediately dealt with.  And this is not a small group of people; we're talking close to a million people who have already been adjudicated and had their status processed through a formal due process system.\nAnd so what we need to do now is to make sure that we focus the resources and the efforts on those people going first and foremost.  And the factsheet and the information that we put out lays that out very, very clearly what is being done.  But for so long, the people at ICE and CBP had their hands cuffed behind them.  And when they were going to deal with the mission of their job, the last administration had so many carve-outs for who could be and who couldn't be adjudicated that it made it very difficult for the customs and enforcement people to do their job and enforce the laws of this country.\nBut right now, what we've done is to make sure that they have the ability and the guidance and the resources to do what their mission is.  And that's it, plain and simple.  And the President is consistent with his priority of making sure that those people who pose a threat to this country are the first ones to go.\nAlexis.\nQ    Sean, on immigration, just to follow up, the President has a carve-out himself for DACA.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    Can you explain the process -- expand on what you were saying on Thursday about the process that the administration is taking to decide --\nMR. SPICER:  And this is what I was basically talking to Cecilia about, which is the President has made clear when you have 12, 14, 15 million people in the country illegally, that there has to be a system of priority.  And right now, ICE's priority is going to make sure that we focus first and foremost on that.  Specifically, in the guidance, it talks about the DACA and DAPA, unless someone who fits under that program fits into the sub-category is not subject to what is being dealt with now.\nRemember, everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time.  That is consistent with every country, not just ours.  If you're in this country in an illegal manner, that obviously there's a provision that could ensure that you be removed.  But the priority that the President has laid forward and the priority that ICE is putting forward through DHS's guidance is to make sure that the people who have committed a crime or pose a threat to our public safety are the priority of their efforts, first and foremost.\nKatelyn.\nQ    John Kasich --\nQ    Let me follow.  The President has also, and his team has also had reservations about undocumented people in the United States who are beneficiaries of public assistance or access to benefits, either at the state or the federal level.  What is the President going to be doing to either issue guidance or executive action of some sort to indicate that he would like to preclude that from continuing?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we have talked in the past about the respect that the President has for taxpayer money with respect to sanctuary cities and the enforcement measures that he's putting forward on immigration.  Right now, obviously, the actions today are focused on people who are in this country and what we need to do on our southern border to facilitate the building of the wall that he's talked about.\nSo we're doing this one step at a time in a very methodical way, and right now the focus is to make sure that ICE and CBP and DHS have the authority and the resources to carry out that first mission.  We will have more -- and then continues to see that immigration is one of those issues that he was very, very clear and consistent on in the campaign, and we're going to continue to implement the policies that he talked about to keep the country safe.\nKatelyn.\nQ    Thank you.  John Kasich has been a very vocal critic of President Trump, even in the campaign, saying his immigration plan was crazy, his statement that the elections were rigged was silly, and he did not endorse him and did not vote for him.  What is the President hoping to accomplish with their meeting at the White House on Friday?\nMR. SPICER:  So, Governor Kasich has reached out on multiple occasions to meet with the President to follow on, and the President has shown through the transition and since his time in office that he wants to meet with anybody that can help move this country forward and share in his vision.  I think that includes people who are with him, who are not with him, who are on the other side of the aisle, who are independents, union workers, business leaders.\nNow that he is President -- and, frankly, I would again date it back to the transition -- he understands that he's the President for every American.  And he's talked consistently about having a united country.  And you do that by bringing people together, whether or not they agree with you on every issue, or one or two issues.  But if there's common ground that can be found to move the country forward, then great.  And I think so many of the President's priority issues are issues that Ohio is dealing with and that he wants to make sure that he can continue to work with Governor Kasich so that every American benefits.\nApril.\nQ    Did Kasich ask for the meeting?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    Okay, what did the President gain from his tour today?  You talked about where he visited, the exhibits that he visited.  Did he also visit slavery?  And the reason why I'm asking is, is because when he was candidate Trump, he said things like \"we made this country,\" meaning white America, and not necessarily black.  Did he gain --\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know why you would say that.  What do you mean?\nQ    No, no, no, he said that.  I heard him say that.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, but look -- the answer to your question is -- one of the first exhibits that he visited was one of the slavery exhibits.  And the director walked him through some very amazing stories and statistics about where slavery was prevailing, not just in traditional Southern colonies but throughout the country.  So they did have a very robust discussion about slavery early on in the tour.\nAnd I think that it was a very eye-opening and powerful tour for him, and, frankly, for every American.  And I would encourage any American that can find the time and get in, because it's so popular.  But it really is enlightening as far as parts of our history that people may not fully appreciate or know, and the contributions and the sacrifices that so many Americans have made that are a critical piece to our history that sometimes don’t get the attention they deserve.\nSo I think the President walked away from there -- and I mentioned in the remarks that he mentioned to Lonnie that he wanted to come back, because you can't do it justice.  And it's much like the Holocaust Museum where you go through it once and then you sit there and start thinking of all the things that you saw, and think, you know, I'd like to go back and more fully explore what I saw because it piqued some degree of interest or intellectual curiosity.\nBut he was very taken aback.  It’s a very, very powerful institution and tour, and it covers a lot of ground.  I think he was really proud to share it with Dr. Carson.  I mean, when you walk through that museum and you see all of the elements of our history, when you walk up to this one glass exhibit that is Dr. Carson's scrubs and pictures of him, and to experience that with him and his wife for the first time, and you realize how amazing that is for any American to be part of a Smithsonian, and you're standing with Dr. Carson and his wife where he is experiencing it with you for the first time and how powerful that must have been was, I think, a real interesting opportunity for him to sit there, hand to hand, with another American and watch them be part of American history.  And you also appreciate some of the real contributions that Dr. Carson has made to medicine and the depth and breadth of his accomplishments.\nQ    And lastly, kind of putting this with the next question, is there any advancement on the CBC meeting with the President?  And also, the head of the CBC said he was wondering if the President saw anything from current and past members of the CBC while he was in the museum, to get a little bit of information on them before this meeting happens.\nMR. SPICER:  I'll have further updates on that.  I know the President looks forward to that meeting, and I think that we're in the process of trying to begin setting that up.  And so I'll have further updates on that once we get closer.  I know that we've got some additional work before the month concludes on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and some meetings that we're working on with them.  But I want to get them locked in before I go further.\nQ    What did he think about the members that he saw in the museum?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, when you walk through one of them, there's a big jumbotron, and we paused for a while, and John Lewis was there giving a very powerful speech.  And we just paused and watched that for a little while.  So, again, I think that, respectfully, when you walk through a museum like this there's a lot of moments where you're just stopping and taking it in, and there's -- if you haven’t been there, you walk up this one ramp and they stop and there's two big screens, and one of them is a video screen, and it's a massive jumbotron --\nQ    The civil rights --\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And we watched the video of John Lewis talking there and describing his efforts in championing voting and civil rights.\nSo I know the President paused and watched it and listened to it.  And again, I would just go back to how he described his overall -- we didn’t dissect the different things, but I watched him and it was a very powerful experience for him, and I know he looks forward to going back.\nHallie.\nQ    Sean, two questions for you.  First one on undocumented immigrants.  You just made very clear that the President's priority is to deport those who pose a threat to public safety.\nMR. SPICER:  Correct.\nQ    I know you're familiar with the case in Arizona of the mother, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos.  Is she a threat to this country?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm going to leave that up to ICE.  We don’t get involved from the White House to particular cases.  That's not --\nQ    But she's a symbol --\nMR. SPICER:  You're right, and I understand.\nQ    But is she a threat to public safety, though?\nMR. SPICER:  But, Hallie, I think the answer is, is that ICE determined that she had violated the law in a way that was in accordance with this.  Again, we've got to go back to this idea that our job, especially here at the White House, isn’t to call balls and strikes and say, well, this person only violated part of the law, or let them go on this.\nIf this was any other subject, if this was tax evasion and we said, well, they only really violated a little bit of -- they only cheated on their taxes a little, you wouldn’t be saying hey, should they really be going to be prison or should they be getting a fine?  At some point, laws are laws.  And if people have a problem with the law, whether it's at the local, state or federal issue, then we should petition our lawmakers and the executive at that particular branch of government and change it.  But our job shouldn’t be to figure out should this individual not have to abide by the law, should this individual get a pass.  If we want to change the law, we've got a very amazing process here in this country to both create and change laws.\nAnd so I don’t want to comment on the specifics of any one case because I think that then puts the White House in a position of deciding who is following the law and who isn’t, and who should get a pass.  The bottom --\nQ    But isn’t it different from you just said of prioritization of cases?  There's a difference --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, there's a difference.  When you have 13 or 14 million people, they're in the country -- you know, I think it's one thing to say prioritize people who pose a threat to public safety and go after this individual or that individual, or whatever.  There's no question, you have to have priorities in anything -- what do you do first, what do you do second, what do you do third.  And when you're talking about, 13, 14, 15, potentially more, millions of people in this country, the President needed to give guidance, especially after what they went through in the last administration where there were so many carve-outs that ICE agents and CBP members had to figure out each individual whether or not they fit in a particular category and they could adjudicate that case.  The President wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies and say:  You have a mission, there are laws that need to be followed; you should do your mission and follow the law.  And for specific cases, I would refer you to ICE in particular and do that.\nQ    Sean, where did you get the 13 and 14 million number?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, Hallie is on number two.\nQ    Thank you.\nQ    The 13, 14 million number -- where did you get that number?\nMR. SPICER:  Glenn, will you please not interrupt her?\nQ    Do you want to take that now?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, I think -- I'm not going to allow you to be interrupted.\nQ    So the second question is on the anti-Semitism comments that you referenced from the podium, the President made very clear.  You said, though, that he has taken opportunities in the past.  Just last week, though, he had the opportunities to deliver a message to the American people about anti-Semitism.  He made very clear he was not anti-Semitic and he was, in fact, insulted by that.  But as far as a broader message to the American people, he declined to offer one.   Is the President comfortable with his obligation as the leader of this country to deliver that kind of broad and forceful message to Americans?  And if so, why didn’t he do it sooner in the case of these attacks?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the idea, Hallie, that -- he has.  And I think there's a point at which he talked literally on election night about uniting this country and making sure that all Americans, et cetera.  And every time there's an instance, it's interesting -- I mean, I get a question, \"Is he going to denounce this one, is he going to denounce this one?\"  At some point, the question is asked and answered.  He has stood very forcefully against --\nQ    That's not what I'm asking.  I'm not asking --\nMR. SPICER:  What are you --\nQ    I'm asking, is he comfortable with his role as the person who needs to be delivering a broader message to America, not denouncing it, which he did clearly today.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And I think that he is very comfortable and understands that as the leader of the free world, the President of this country, the Commander-in-Chief, that he has an awesome responsibility to make it very clear where we're going as a country and what our values are, and that he has spoken very forcefully that we don’t stand for this kind of behaviors, and words, and intolerance, that we are a country that should bring people together and that we shouldn’t tolerate people who are hating on individuals because of their gender or because of their religion or the color of their skin, or a variety of other things, but that there's a point at which it's asked and answered.\nAnd I think the President has been very clear over and over again, going back through the campaign, the transition and now, that that's the kind of President that he wants to be, that's the kind of country that he wants to lead.\nTrey.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Following the DHS memos this morning, the ACLU said the courts won't allow these orders to become a reality.  How is the administration preparing for another potential legal battle?  And do you have any response to the ACLU?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think we have done a phenomenal job of working with the various departments, particularly DHS and DOJ, State, and through the White House staff, to make sure that we are well within any concerns that the court might have.\nAnd as I mentioned, I think it's important to continue to emphasize we feel as though the first one did that as well, and we were vindicated several times in the court.  We have an issue with the 9th Circuit and I think we will overcome that, ultimately, on the merits.  But in the meantime, a dual-track is something that we wanted to pursue to make sure that we do everything we can, as I mentioned before, to keep the country safe.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  The Australian foreign minister is here today, meeting the Vice President.\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry, say that again.\nQ    The Australian foreign minister is meeting the Vice President today and also the Secretary of State tomorrow.  I guess we can assume that the U.S.-Australia refugee deal will come up.  Now, last time we spoke, the President was still considering and reviewing a deal.  Can you just update us on what the current position is?\nMR. SPICER:  We'll have a readout of that.\nQ    And just --\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, of course everyone gets two.  (Laughter.)\nQ    If you could just update us on the current position on the deal.  And also, given that recent exposure on the President's distaste for it, will Australia be expected to return the favor?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, again, I would wait.  We'll have a readout after that call as far as what they discussed.  But I've got nothing -- I don't want to get ahead of the Vice President's meeting with either the Secretary of State or the Vice President.\nKristen.\nQ    Thank you.  I have two questions.  One, on the immigration refugee executive order that we're expecting in the coming days, so that it withstands legal challenges, can you tell us what the language might look like as it relates to Syrian refugees?\nMR. SPICER:  I appreciate the effort, but when we have it ready we'll get it out.  And I think part of this is --\nQ    (Inaudible) ban on Syrian refugees?\nMR. SPICER:  Excuse me?  Again, I appreciate the second try, but we're not ready to announce it.  And part of it is, is that we're making sure that it is completely ready to go.  And so when we have that, we will get it out to you.  And I would just -- the reason that we haven't announced it is it's not ready to be announced.\nQ    I want to try one more on --\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.\nQ    -- the comments that the President made today about anti-Semitism.  In terms of the timing, obviously he was asked about it, but they also came after his daughter, Ivanka, sent out that tweet.  Has she counseled him?  Was she one of the people saying it's important for you to forcefully denounce this?  Why today?\nMR. SPICER:  Because the President was visiting the African American Museum, he wanted to make it very clear.  I think it was very powerful that, while there, and while understanding the struggles of so many -- and we talk about how one of the beauties of history is that we don't repeat itself.  And I think that when you're at a museum like that and seeing the struggles that so many Americans faced and overcame, that you want to remind people that there is still issues that our country is grappling with and that there is no place for that hate and for that language.\nAnd I think -- as I mentioned, it was a very powerful opportunity for him to say that and to make clear, again, what his opinions were.\nQ    Does he regret not doing it last week, Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry?\nQ    Does he regret not stating this comment last week?\nMR. SPICER:  The President was very clear.  That was a very -- I think, as I mentioned to Hallie, he has discussed this over and over again.  I think there's a point to which his position is abundantly clear.  His attempts and his desire and his rhetoric to unite the country has been expressed over and over again.\nSarah.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  The New York Times is reporting that Trump's budget director is preparing a budget that eliminates the Export-Import Bank.  But several lawmakers, including Senator Heitkamp, have come out of private meetings with President Trump and said that in those private meetings he expressed support for the export bank.  So which is it?  Does he support Ex-Im or does he support eliminating it?\nMR. SPICER:  I can confirm that the OMB director -- the budget director is working on a budget.  (Laughter.)  Beyond that, I'm not going to get ahead of the OMB director right now.  They are drafting a budget, they are talking to members of Congress and other interested parties about funding levels and such, but we're not at a position to go yet.\nYes.\nQ    Sean, just wanted to circle on Alexis's question.  Since the DHS guidance did not eliminate DACA, does that mean that the program is remaining in place, that it's a settled matter and it's not going away?\nMR. SPICER:  No, Jordan.  What it means is that this particular enforcement is tailored to what I have been referencing over and over again -- that what we're talking about today is the implementation of those two executive orders, one specifically that's tasking the agencies under DHS to address a very specific problem of the million or so, plus or minus, people that they have identified, that they have then adjudicated with already going through the process to be adjudicated and taken out of the country.\nQ    That means a decision on DACA could come any day.\nMR. SPICER:  That's right, exactly.  It just means that this -- what it means, more than anything, is that this order does not address that and it's very clear in the Q&A -- and, again, I would refer you back to DHS's website that has all of that.\nGoyal.\nQ    Thank you very much.  Two questions please.  One, it's been one month on the job for you and for the President, and you are already talk of the town around the globe.  (Laughter.)  My two questions are, one --\nMR. SPICER:  My wife would disagree with you.  (Laughter.)  It's not always positive, too.\nQ    It looks like, Sean, that the President's order is working at least around the globe because more than 60,000 Pakistanis have been deported by Saudi Arabia.  But they're saying that they were illegals and also they're a threat to the country.  And also, at the same time, Pakistani government is arresting hundreds of terrorists inside the country.  Any presidential message?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I'm not going to -- there's nothing that I have in terms of an update of what's going on in Pakistan.  I would refer you to the Department of State with respect to specific policies.  But the broader point that you're making is I think each country needs to look at what they need to do to control the people that are entering their country and keep their people safe.\nWhen you look at our laws in particular, and compare them to so many other countries around the globe, we actually tend to probably fall in the lower end of how tough our immigration policies are vis-à-vis someone else.\nQ    Sean, my second question.\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry.\nQ    As far as illegal immigrants are concerned in the U.S., millions of illegal immigrants that were waiting for the last eight or ten years that they might see a light in the dark tunnel, and now they’re hoping that President Trump will have a light for them.  So what is the President’s message for them who are in this country for five, 10, 15 or 20 years but they’re not -- they don’t have any criminal records?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, look, the President has said before he’s got a big heart.  And I think that as we continue to develop policy on immigration, it’s going to be, as we’ve talked about in the past, prioritized -- what we go after first, second third.  The President has made very clear he understands the plight of some of those individuals.  He’s got a big heart.  He understands the impact it has on many families, many communities.\nBut we will continue to develop policies that will address that.  And again, today’s focus is specifically on those two executive orders, and I’m going to limit it to that.\nQ    Sean, at the beginning of the month, Senator John McCain sent a letter to the President requesting that the administration provide arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists within their country.  When will the President respond to Senator McCain’s letter?  And what is the administration’s position on lethal aid to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t have anything for you on that.  I’ll try to get back to you on that.  I know that we’re very pleased to watch Senator McCain praise the pick of General McMaster.  That’s obviously someone that we will consult with.  But we were pleased to see so much support for him.\nScott Newman (ph).\nQ    On Russia -- critics of the President have said that at time he doesn’t talk tough enough on the subject.  General McMaster, though, has been labeled by a lot of people as being pretty hawkish.  I’m curious what, if any, difference in tone or tenor or strategy we should expect now that they’re working together.\nQ    Well, I think, as I mentioned a couple times, I think there is widespread praise for General McMaster and his understanding and command of national security matters, foreign policy matters.  He’s going to be a great asset to the President’s national security team.\nBut ultimately, the President has always been the decider, whether it’s Russia or any other issue.  And I think you’re right, he has made it very clear that if he can get a deal with Russia, something that the last several administrations have tried to do, that he’s going to do it.  And if he can’t, he won’t.  But he is going to try.  And I think his success as a businessman and negotiator should be seen as a positive sign for him to be able to do that.\nBut he understands that if he can find common ground on defeating ISIS and combatting terrorism, growing the economy where we can find areas of economic interest, then we’re going to do it.  But that’s where we’re going to continue to work with Russia if we can.  He’ll get a deal.  If he can’t, he won’t.  But he’s going to try.  And I think where others have failed, he’s going to make sure that he does everything possible to make sure that if it’s in the interest of the United States he will get a deal.\nQ    I have another question on General McMaster.  So how much leeway is he going to get to restructure, to bring on his own people?  There were some reports that Admiral Harward was not allowed to, or others as well.  So can you address that?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  I can.  He will have 100 percent.  The President has been very, very clear with that.  He is the National Security Advisor, and he will have whatever he needs to implement a successful team.\nBut with respect to Admiral Harward that you brought up, Admiral Harward made it very, very clear that he wanted this job, he would love to take it.  He was impressed with the team.  But during the course of discussions, it came up -- he said: Before I continue with this discussion, I need to address some financial and family concerns.  He went back, he came back to us and said, I am unable to continue the discussions because of there’s some financial concerns and some family issues that we have.  I spent 40 years serving this country in the United States Navy.\nI talked to him again Saturday night, and he said:  If there’s another opening in a year or two, I would be honored, I am so impressed with the team that’s there.\nAnd I would urge people to actually talk to him.  He was so excited about being part of the team.  He was available to as many reporters as he could take.  We gave out his information -- his contact information.  And he’s been very clear.  He wrote a letter to the President prior to -- first thing Tuesday morning.  He was in the UAE, he sent the letter over and we had it first thing in the morning, where he said, because of family concerns, because of some financial constraints, having served this nation for 40 years, I can’t take this job, but I'm unbelievably impressed.\nAll of the rumors about the discretion that he would have over staff or any other thing were 100 percent false.  He's made it clear that he would love to serve in the future, that he was impressed with the team, that he wanted to do this.  There were just some constraints financially and family-wise that come with -- or after having served 40 years in the military, sacrifices both financially and family-wise that he had had to make.\nBut I talked to him several times, and the team has talked to him.  But ultimately, the President was very, very impressed with General McMaster.  He had always been one of the individuals that he thought stood above so many other folks.  He was impressed with the entire list, John Bolton and others.  But so many people had spoken to him.  General Mattis, Tom Cotton, other senators really praised General McMaster's command of the issues, his management, his style, his understanding of the geopolitical landscape.  And I think that's why you saw such amazing widespread bipartisan praise for him, and why he will be such an asset to the national security team.  So, ultimately, we ended up with the best choice.  And I think that's going to benefit not just this administration but our entire nation.\nQ    Sean, can we expect him to get anyone else from the top of -- any senior people at the NSC?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry?\nQ    Can we expect that he may replace any others in the NSC?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I just can't be any clearer.  I think that we've got an amazing team.  He's been impressed with them.  But the President has, as he did with other candidates, told them that they would lead the team and that he would have the discretion of it.\nJeff.\nQ    I just wanted to follow on that.  You said that he has the full authority to structure his office as he sees fit.  Does that extend to the principals committee, as well?  After he comes in and takes a look at the whole apparatus, if he advises the President and he would prefer not to have the chief strategist as a member of the principals committee, would the President --\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President has made clear to him he's got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants.  Obviously, with something like that, he would come to the President and make that recommendation.  But the President would take that under serious consideration.  I don’t want to go ahead with this person or that person or structure, but the President made it very clear with him and the other candidates that they had 100 percent control and authority over the national security committee.\nThank you, guys.  I'll see you tomorrow.\nQ    Will McMaster have to retire?  Can you clarify that?\nMR. SPICER:  No, he will stay on active duty.\nQ    Does that require Senate confirmation then?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  He will stay on active duty.  That was the case with Powell and I think some other folks.\nQ    One more clarification just before you go.  So when the new EO comes out, you won't rescind the original one and you'll leave it in place?\nMR. SPICER:  That's correct.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.\nEND\n2:41 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-02-21T00:00:00", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/21/2017, #13"}

Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:42 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Hey, good afternoon, everyone.  It's been a little while.  Hope you missed me.  (Laughter.)\nQ    You missed us?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  We’ve got a lot to talk about today, so let’s get right to it.\nFirst off, I want to acknowledge the tragic plane crash that occurred in Australia that took the lives of five individuals, including four Americans.  The President’s thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, and the U.S. embassy and consulate are ready to provide necessary and appropriate assistance.\nMoving on, the President was honored to announce that Lieutenant General McMaster will be his National Security Advisor.  General McMaster served this nation in the United States Army for over three decades, including during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Desert Storm.\nThe President met with many distinguished and qualified candidates for the position, and as he has said that he will continue to consider many of them for other positions within the administration.  He is especially pleased that Lieutenant General Kellogg will stay on as the National Security Council Chief of Staff.\nThe President is proud to welcome General McMaster to the team where he will have full authority to structure the office to his desires to best serve its ultimate mission, which is to protect the American interests at home and abroad.\nThis morning, Secretary Kelly and the Department of Homeland Security released memos regarding the implementation of two of the President’s executive orders that are designed to protect the homeland.  These two memos provide explicit guidance to DHS staff on how to carry out two executive orders signed by the President on January 25th -- one dealing with interior enforcement and one dealing with border security.  Perhaps most critically, the President is empowering DHS to carry out the immigration laws currently on the books.\nOf course, DHS gave a full briefing on these memos this morning, but just to briefly summarize a few of the facts:  The memo regarding the executive order “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” outlines several practices and policies in order to strengthen the efficient and faithful execution of this country’s immigration laws.  That includes hiring more ICE agents and officers, as well as additional mission support and legal staff necessary to support their activities.  This memo also directs the establishment of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within ICE, fulfilling another major campaign promise of the President.  This office will facilitate the engagement with victims and their families to ensure that their questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed.\nThe memo regarding the executive order “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements” outlines the steps that DHS will take to secure the nation’s southern border, prevent further illegal immigration, and to repatriate illegal immigrants swiftly, consistently, and humanely.  This includes immediately identifying and allocating all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall along our southern border and hiring of additional personnel, including 5,000 additional CBP border agents.\nAgain, I would refer you to DHS for further comment on these specific memos.  There are factsheets and Q&As on the DHS website that address many of the intricacies in areas within each of these executive orders that you might have questions on.\nAlso, this weekend, the President had calls with the President of Panama and the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago.  Readouts of those calls have both been provided.\nThe President’s team this weekend also had a very productive meeting on the President’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and ensure that it is replaced with a system that works for all Americans.\nBack to the President’s schedule today, in honor of Black History Month, the President started his day by visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture.  The museum opened last September and has quickly become one of Washington’s most-visited attractions.\nThe President was joined by a group of individuals that included his daughter, Ivanka; Dr. Ben Carson and his wife; Senator Tim Scott;\nAlveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; museum director Lonnie Bunch; Dr. David Skorton, who is the Secretary of the Smithsonian, as well as others.\nThe President commented several times during his tour about how impressed he was with the museum.  Some of the exhibits that he was particularly drawn to included the section on Harriet Tubman, which featured a shawl that was given to her by Queen Victoria in the late 1800s; the section of the museum that featured the courageous contribution of African Americans that have made to the United States military.  And the President was particularly pleased by the Muhammad Ali exhibit with the quote, “I shook up the world” prominently displayed.\nThe President also enjoyed viewing for the first time with Dr. and Mrs. Carson the exhibit dedicated to his extraordinary life.  Similarly, Alveda King, who had never viewed the museum’s exhibit on her uncle, the President was honored that he was able to share this experience with the two of them specifically.\nThe President further expressed his appreciation for the tour, and said he looks forward to returning again.  His desire is to honor the immense contributions of courageous African American leaders throughout our history by building a more unified country, dedicated to liberty and justice.\nThis afternoon, the President will have a routine, classified National Security Council briefing in the Situation Room, in addition to his Presidential Daily Briefing, which he received earlier this morning.\nThen, this evening the President will have dinner with Vice President Pence.  I’m sure that they will discuss the Vice President's recent trip to Europe.  The Vice President was an incredible representative for our nation and the President during his time, where he reiterated our support for our European allies in unified pursuit of the noble ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice, and the rule of law and discussing how to do more to encourage all NATO allies to meet their financial obligations and commitments.\nDuring his speech before the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, the Vice President conveyed the administration’s unwavering commitment to Europe’s peace and prosperity, especially remembering the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives to defend those ideals during both World War I and II.  These shared sacrifices are the backbone of our alliance and our mission of security through strength.\nDuring his time in Munich, the Vice President also met with nine world leaders.  The Vice President and these leaders discussed the issues most pressing to them, including the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine and the role of NATO in the fight against ISIS.  The Vice President also met in Brussels with President of Tusk -- Vice President Tusk of the Council of the European Union and NATO Secretary -- the NATO Secretary General.\nAs a candidate for office, President Trump actually called attention repeatedly to the fact that for too long, many of our NATO allies have not been sharing the financial burden.  The President looks forward to working closely with NATO to advance our shared objectives.  A strong NATO means a safer world.  And the United States looks forward to working with our partners in NATO to achieve just that.\nLooking ahead to the President’s upcoming schedule -- tomorrow, he will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson, fresh off his trip to Germany for the G20 Foreign Ministers Summit.  They'll discuss the President’s foreign policy agenda and the Secretary’s upcoming trip to Mexico.\nThursday morning, he'll have a listening session regarding job creation in the manufacturing sector with CEOs and business leaders from different industries.\nOn Friday, he'll deliver remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference.  And we are just one week out today from the President’s Joint Address to Congress.\nThe President will continue to work closely with his team to craft a speech that lays out his ambitious policy agenda that will benefit all Americans.  Plans are currently in the works for pre- and post-address activities for the President and his staff.  And we'll have more updates as the week goes on.\nBefore I take your questions, I want to address the recent threats and acts of vandalism on Jewish community centers throughout the country.  The President said this morning -- I just want to reiterate -- \"The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community centers are horrible and painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that we must do\" -- excuse me -- \"the work that must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.\"\nWith that, I’ll take some of your questions.  Jim Stinson.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  I was curious if the President regrets or wants to clarify his characterization -- by the way, I have two questions -- of the media as an \"enemy of the American people.\"\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President has been very clear that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not represent his record accurately, and it is a concern to him.\nAnd I think some reporters -- he has deep respect for the First Amendment, for the role of the press -- I’ve addressed this multiple times in the past.  He has a healthy respect for the press.  But I think that it’s a two-way street, as I’ve also said before, and I think that the President understands that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not be completely accurate and fair in their coverage of what’s going on.\nQ    Speaking of the media, I’ve noticed two times in the last week that you’ve been directly contradicted by two members of the media, one of them Bill Maher of HBO, who said that in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago, the President was briefed on the classified North Korean situation.\nMR. SPICER:  Say that again, I’m sorry.\nQ    The President and the Prime Minister of Japan were briefed in front of guests --\nMR. SPICER:  No, I didn’t say that.\nQ    No, no, no, this is what was being said on HBO, that the President and the Prime Minister were briefed on classified information in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago.  I just want to clarify, did that happen?  Did they --\nMR. SPICER:  No.  No.  I think I walked through this timeline before, Jim.  And it’s amazing -- a photo gets put out, the President has got a piece of paper, and the immediate conclusion is he’s got to be talking about classified information.\nThe President was briefed on the situation in North Korea prior to the dinner, in a SCIF, that’s at Mar-a-Lago.  He went and had dinner.  He discussed the logistics of the press conference, which I’ve talked to you all before -- there was a question as to where to hold the press conference.  They had a discussion about the logistics of it.  And subsequent to that dinner, he was briefed again in a SCIF with updates on the situation in North Korea.  That’s it, plain and simple.\nBut to your first question, I think that it’s amazing that the immediate jump of conclusion to several outlets was, well, there’s a piece of paper, it must be classified.  I don’t -- it’s amazing to see that and to see people jump to that conclusion that he’s surrounded by his staff and members of the Japanese delegation, the conclusion is they must be doing something nefarious or wrong.  In fact, he followed every procedure that’s laid out.\nAnd I think in some cases, it’s disheartening to realize that those are the kind of immediate conclusions that somebody jumps to.  So when you talk about coverage, we have a free press.  We have the right for people to say and do what they believe.  But at some point, it is incumbent upon people to try to get it right.  And in that case, it wasn’t even attempted.  It was a jump to conclusion by many to say that there must be something else going on when, in fact, we were able to provide a very, very clear tick-tock as to what had happened in that.\nJessica.\nQ    Sean, a question about the resignation of 10 people on the Asian American Council.  That happened last week.  And in the letter, they said in part, “We can no longer serve a President whose policies aim to create outcomes that are diametrically opposite to our principles, goals and charge.”  First of all, what’s the White House’s reaction?  And do you plan to appoint your own members to this council?\nMR. SPICER:  Those members of that council were political appointees of the Obama administration.  Their terms were set to expire this year.  So it’s not surprising in the sense that they were appointees of Barack Obama.  They were going to have their terms expire.\nQ    But in terms of --\nBut again, but -- I get it, but most political appointees from other agencies or whatever would automatically resign because of the term of these individuals, they would carry through until later in the year.  But I don’t think it’s surprising that people who were appointed by Barack Obama to fulfill his agenda suddenly understand that there is a new administration in town and didn’t want to stay on board.\nBut we will make sure that we appoint people to this task force.  It’s important.  It’s something that’s provided guidance to multiple presidents in the past, and we will continue to do that.\nShannon.\nQ    On the statement today about the anti-Semitic acts, what specifically is the President going to do to address that issue?  And, along those lines, there were reports earlier on that he was considering changing the mandate of this countering violent extremism program to focus just on Islamic extremist groups.  Is he still considering that, or would he also leave the scope of the program to also consider --\nMR. SPICER:  Are you talking about the travel executive order?\nQ    No, no, no, this is the countering violent extremism program that --\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves there.  There’s nothing to announce on that front.  And secondly, to the first part of your question, I think the President is going to do what he’s talked about since election night.  It’s through deed and action, talk about how we can unify this country and speak out against hate, anti-Semitism, racism.  And he’s going to continue to do that.\nAnd I think that he will show you over the course of months and years, through what he does in terms of his policies and his speech, that he is going to be a President that brings people together, that unites them, and that speaks very, very forcefully against those who are seeking to do hate or to tear people down because of their religion or their gender or the color of their skin.  I mean, those are all things that I think the President was clear on.\nJohn.\nQ    Two questions unrelated, if I could.  The next big piece in the immigration profile here at the White House is going to be the new executive order.  Is the President confident that this one will pass legal muster?  And if he is, what gives him that confidence?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think -- first, I want to be clear that we feel confident that we’re still going to prevail on the case -- the merits of the case.  I think that as was seen in the case of Massachusetts, once it is fully adjudicated, we will prevail because the authority is granted to the President to do what he has to, to protect the country.  So I feel very, very confident about where we're going to go.\nThe second track that he's made very clear as well is that until that occurs, we're going to have a dual-track system.  And then we're going to make sure that we implement a second executive order that is tailored to achieve the same goals but in accordance with what the court said.  So we've been working very closely with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the team here at the White House to make sure that the next step achieves the President's goal of protecting the country and does so in a way that recognizes the concerns that the court had until we prevail at a later time.  So it's a dual-track thing.\nQ    Will this administration send American terror suspects picked up overseas to Guantanamo Bay for interrogation or prosecution?\nMR. SPICER:  I am not going to discuss that right now.  As the President has said very clearly before, we don't telegraph what we're going to do.  I think he has made very clear, though, that he believes that Guantanamo Bay does serve a very, very healthy purpose in our national security in making sure that we don't bring terrorists to our seas.  But I'm not going to get into what we may or may not do in the future.\nQ    Including American citizens?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I'm just not going to --\nQ    Sean, I want to give you a chance to respond to something because I think the President's remarks and your clarification about where he stands on anti-Semitism is clear.  But after that statement was made by the President, The Anne Frank Center released a pretty strongly worded one, saying that these remarks, while well-received, are a Band-Aid on the cancer within the Trump administration, saying that there is, whether blessed or otherwise, a sense of xenophobia within this administration.  What do you think about that?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, the President has made clear since the day he was elected and, frankly, going back through the campaign, that he is someone who seeks to unite this country.  He has brought a diverse group of folks into his administration, both in terms of actual positions and people that he has sought the advice of.  And I think he has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their hate -- excuse me, because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin.  And it is something that he is going to continue to fight and make very, very clear that he has no place in this administration.\nBut I think that it's ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, that it's never good enough.  Today I think was an unbelievably forceful comment by the President as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted towards Jewish community centers, but I think that he's been very clear previous to this that he wants to be someone that brings this country together and not divide people, especially in those areas.\nSo I saw that statement.  I wish that they had praised the President for his leadership in this area.  And I think that hopefully, as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans.\nQ    Sean, on that, the southern part of --\nMR. SPICER:  We started early with the two questions.\nQ    Sorry.  Sean, Southern Poverty -- I think you'll want to respond to this.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.\nQ    Southern Poverty Law Center said that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S. has tripled between 2015 and 2016, during the time of the campaign.  Is this message within the administration -- anti-Semitism is not allowed, xenophobia is not allowed -- anti-Muslim sentiment within the administration, has the President been forceful about that particular issue?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that the President, in terms of his desire to combat radical Islamic terrorism, he understands that people who want to express a peaceful position have every right in our Constitution.  But if you come here or want to express views that seek to do our country or our people harm, he is going to fight it aggressively, whether it's domestic acts that are going on here or attempts through people abroad to come into this country.  So there's a big difference between preventing attacks and making sure that we keep this country safe so that there is no loss of life in allowing people to express themselves in accordance with our First Amendment.  Those are two very, very different, different, different things.\nQ    Sean, you talked about how the manufacturing -- I didn't know where you were going.\nMR. SPICER:  I was (inaudible) in the back.  (Laughter.)\nQ    I saw the manufacturing CEOs are coming on Thursday, so let me ask you something that's important to them, which is the border adjustment tax.   The President earlier this year called it \"too complicated.\"  Does he still feel that way?  And whether he feels this is complicated or not, is there something within the administration one way or another about whether the President, the administration wants to see this in or out of the tax package?\nMR. SPICER:  So there’s several pieces to that that I’ll try to unpack.  That counts as, like, eight questions.\nQ    Does he feel it’s complicated, and what’s your preference?\nMR. SPICER:  So, first of all, on the meeting on Thursday, this is going to be a really historic opportunity for CEOs to come in and talk to members of the White House staff and others through various agencies about how we can create jobs, how regulations are stifling economic growth.  And I think we’ll have further details on that, but this is going to be a real interesting opportunity to really create a dialogue I think in a manner that hasn’t been done before -- but I’m not going to get ahead of myself on this -- where we can really discuss some of the inhibitors to job creation, job retraining, what do we need for American workers to get them ahead of the curve.\nWith respect to specific policy positions, I think the President has been very clear that in the next couple weeks we expect to have a tax plan that gets out there.  That is being worked on continuously.  And so I’m not going to get in front of that.  While the CEOs are here, I’m sure beyond some of these things, that’s an opportunity for them to express what some of those policies are that are both helping them create jobs and grow the economy, and also inhibiting them.  So let’s let that conversation play out.\nYes.\nQ    Okay, thank you, Sean.  My name is Raquel (ph) from TV Global News (ph) Brazil.  And I have a question.  There are doubts in Brazil right now about what’s going to happen to the relationship between the two countries with the new administration, especially related to immigration and also to trade deals.  Does President Trump also plan to review policies -- bilateral policies with Brazil in trade deals?  And also, my second question, how does the administration see the current turmoil -- economical and political turmoil in Brazil?\nAnd one more question, if I might.  (Laughter.)  President Trump spoke with some foreign leaders from South America, like Argentina, Colombia and Peru, but not -- it was the Vice President that spoke with President Temer from Brazil.  Why is that?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, obviously, we cherish our relationship with Brazil.  I think there’s a timing factor here and I think we’ll look forward to speaking with the President soon.  So I wouldn’t read too much into that right now.  It’s just a matter of getting things on the schedule.\nWe’re going to review all the trade deals that are out there.  The President has made very clear some of them have occurred well into a decade, two decades ago.  I think the idea is to make sure that we are looking at all of the trade deals we have throughout the globe to make sure that they continue to benefit America and American workers.    And in many cases, we can update these deals.\nSo it’s not any one particular country.  I think that we’re going to look throughout the whole host of trade agreements, and then other trade-related agreements that we have with countries to make sure that they are the most up-to-date and they address the technological advances that have occurred, and look at the various services -- whether it’s financial services or manufacturing -- and that they reflect the current state of play.\nSo this isn’t any one country.  I think the President made clear throughout the campaign and subsequent that he wants to review every trade deal to make sure that America and American workers are maintaining the best deal possible.\nCorbett (ph).  Oh, I’m sorry.\nQ    And on the turmoil, how does the administration see the turmoil in Brazil now?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m going to -- I think that’s a question for the Department of State right now.\nCorbett, yeah.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Two questions for you.  One on the NSC meeting later this afternoon.  Is that the first meeting of the National Security Council of the President with all the principals there?\nMR. SPICER:  No, that is just a routine briefing.  But because of the nature of it, it’s happening in the Situation Room.\nQ    But is that with staff, or is that with --\nMR. SPICER:  Staff.\nQ    Okay, so it’s not with, like, the principals committee.\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nQ    When do you anticipate the first formal meeting of the National Security Council?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think General McMaster got here at noon today, so -- (laughter) -- we move fast, but I think that we need to give him a few days probably to get his team together.\nSo the President was obviously very pleased with the selection.  I think when you saw the bipartisan support that General McMaster received from the variety of the political spectrum -- people who have served Republicans and Democrats, academics, pundits, columnists -- you know that he made an outstanding choice.  We want to get him in, show him around the office a little bit, and then get him going.\nBut when we have a date to announce the next meeting, we’ll let you know.\nQ    The joint address for next week, what’s the President’s goal for that address?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that -- I’ll have a further update as the week goes on, and we’ll have briefings.  The President is going to lay out I think two main things -- where we’ve come and where we’re going.  I think that he is very pleased with the progress that he has made so far in the first month in office, and I think it’s an opportunity to remind members of Congress and the American people what he promised them on the campaign trail, what he’s done already in a very significant way to achieve and fulfill those promises that he made, but also talk about the challenges that we have as a nation and where we’re going.  And that’s everything from our relationship with other countries in this world to some of the various domestic problems that we face, the challenges that we face in cities, health care, education.\nBut the President wants to make sure that the American people have a very clear indication as to where he’s taking this country and why he’s going to enact the policies he’s going to enact.\nJohn.  George, I’m sorry.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Let me ask you a question about the Vice President’s European trip.  I’m curious whether he received any commitments from our European allies to commit more in terms of their financial contribution to NATO.\nMR. SPICER:  I think several of them -- I saw Chancellor Merkel’s comments previous to that, noting that they understand that the U.S. is asking for that commitment.\nLook, we’re one of the only countries -- there’s a handful -- that are doing what NATO requires, which is 2 percent of GDP.  Some of them are at 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and some of them are below that.  But we’ve got to ask them to do what they agreed to do.  And I think we’ve had a very positive reaction from most of these NATO countries that understand that the financial agreement that they agreed to is something that they need to live up to.\nAnd I think the Vice President continued to receive assurances, much like the President has through his foreign leader calls, where people not only understand it but are willing to follow through on it.\nQ    So it’s an ongoing process, or --\nMR. SPICER:  Of course it’s an ongoing -- I mean, I think we need to follow up to make sure that the commitments that they’re making on the phone or in person, in the case of the Vice President, are followed up.\nDave.\nQ    Sean, thanks.  The DHS memos today -- obviously these immigration enforcement efforts cost money, hiring more agents.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    Do you envision that the current budget is sufficient, or are you going to need to go to Congress for more money?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think right now ICE and DHS in particular, as well as CBP, are looking at what this is going to cost and how much and putting a request together, and then figuring out how much can be handled through reallocation of resources and how much we can save maybe in another area, but then also work with Congress.\nQ    One other subject, different matter.  There was an election report out today that the President raised more small campaign donations in 2016 than either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders combined.  Did he have a reaction to that?  Has he seen that?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know, and I would ask you to probably go through the RNC for that.  That’s a political matter that we generally don’t discuss.\nYeah.\nQ    Sean, the National Center for Transgender Equality, citing reliable sources, says the Trump administration today will rescind Obama-era guidance requiring schools to allow transgender kids to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity.  Will the Trump administration rescind that guidance?\nMR. SPICER:  Right now that’s an issue that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are addressing.  I would tell you that -- and I think that there will be further guidance coming from DOJ in particular with respect to not just the executive order, but also the case that’s in front of the Supreme Court.\nThe President has maintained for a long time that this is a states' rights issue and not one for the federal government.  So while there will be further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the President’s view has been for a long time -- that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in; this is a states' rights issue.\nMatt.\nQ    In the wake of the Vice President’s trip to Europe, there’s questions as to the administration’s position on the future of the European Union with regard to a number of political movements across the continent advocating for the disbandment eventually of the European Union.  I wanted to see if you could clarity the administration’s position on the future of the European Union.\nMR. SPICER:  I think the Vice President had great meetings with several European Union leaders and made it very clear to them that we’ll continue to work with them, and reaffirmed our commitment to working with these nations.  I mean, there’s no update on that.\nCecilia.\nQ    Thank you.  On immigration, on the DHS memo, two parts, if I may.  Is one of the goals here mass deportation?\nMR. SPICER:  No, not at all.  This isn’t -- look, I think what we have to get back to is understanding a couple things.  There’s a law in place that says if you’re in this country illegally, that we have an obligation to make sure that the people who are in our country are here legally.  What the order sets out today is ensures that the million-or-so people that have been adjudicated already, that ICE prioritizes, creates a system of prioritization, and makes sure that we walk through that system in a way that protects this country.\nThis is consistent with everything the President has talked about, which is prioritizing the people who are here who represent a threat to public safety or have a criminal record.  And all this does is lay out the exact procedures to make sure that that subgroup of people who pose a threat to our nation because of a conviction or a violation of public safety or have a criminal record are adjudicated first and foremost.  That's it, plain and simple.\nQ    So is then -- a follow-up to that.  Is the White House's message to date to undocumented people in this country whose only crime is being in this country illegally, \"Don't worry, or you're on notice\"?\nMR. SPICER:  No, the message from this White House and from the DHS is that those people who are in this country and pose a threat to our public safety or have committed a crime will be the first to go and we will be aggressively making sure that that occurs.  That is what the priority is.\nQ    What about the others who aren't?  They're watching this fearful right now.\nMR. SPICER:  Cecilia, the President has said multiple times that we've got to look at this issue on a very, very holistic way.  And the number-one priority when you look at the scope of how many people are in the country illegally, the number-one priority is making sure that people who pose a threat to this country are immediately dealt with.  And this is not a small group of people; we're talking close to a million people who have already been adjudicated and had their status processed through a formal due process system.\nAnd so what we need to do now is to make sure that we focus the resources and the efforts on those people going first and foremost.  And the factsheet and the information that we put out lays that out very, very clearly what is being done.  But for so long, the people at ICE and CBP had their hands cuffed behind them.  And when they were going to deal with the mission of their job, the last administration had so many carve-outs for who could be and who couldn't be adjudicated that it made it very difficult for the customs and enforcement people to do their job and enforce the laws of this country.\nBut right now, what we've done is to make sure that they have the ability and the guidance and the resources to do what their mission is.  And that's it, plain and simple.  And the President is consistent with his priority of making sure that those people who pose a threat to this country are the first ones to go.\nAlexis.\nQ    Sean, on immigration, just to follow up, the President has a carve-out himself for DACA.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    Can you explain the process -- expand on what you were saying on Thursday about the process that the administration is taking to decide --\nMR. SPICER:  And this is what I was basically talking to Cecilia about, which is the President has made clear when you have 12, 14, 15 million people in the country illegally, that there has to be a system of priority.  And right now, ICE's priority is going to make sure that we focus first and foremost on that.  Specifically, in the guidance, it talks about the DACA and DAPA, unless someone who fits under that program fits into the sub-category is not subject to what is being dealt with now.\nRemember, everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time.  That is consistent with every country, not just ours.  If you're in this country in an illegal manner, that obviously there's a provision that could ensure that you be removed.  But the priority that the President has laid forward and the priority that ICE is putting forward through DHS's guidance is to make sure that the people who have committed a crime or pose a threat to our public safety are the priority of their efforts, first and foremost.\nKatelyn.\nQ    John Kasich --\nQ    Let me follow.  The President has also, and his team has also had reservations about undocumented people in the United States who are beneficiaries of public assistance or access to benefits, either at the state or the federal level.  What is the President going to be doing to either issue guidance or executive action of some sort to indicate that he would like to preclude that from continuing?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we have talked in the past about the respect that the President has for taxpayer money with respect to sanctuary cities and the enforcement measures that he's putting forward on immigration.  Right now, obviously, the actions today are focused on people who are in this country and what we need to do on our southern border to facilitate the building of the wall that he's talked about.\nSo we're doing this one step at a time in a very methodical way, and right now the focus is to make sure that ICE and CBP and DHS have the authority and the resources to carry out that first mission.  We will have more -- and then continues to see that immigration is one of those issues that he was very, very clear and consistent on in the campaign, and we're going to continue to implement the policies that he talked about to keep the country safe.\nKatelyn.\nQ    Thank you.  John Kasich has been a very vocal critic of President Trump, even in the campaign, saying his immigration plan was crazy, his statement that the elections were rigged was silly, and he did not endorse him and did not vote for him.  What is the President hoping to accomplish with their meeting at the White House on Friday?\nMR. SPICER:  So, Governor Kasich has reached out on multiple occasions to meet with the President to follow on, and the President has shown through the transition and since his time in office that he wants to meet with anybody that can help move this country forward and share in his vision.  I think that includes people who are with him, who are not with him, who are on the other side of the aisle, who are independents, union workers, business leaders.\nNow that he is President -- and, frankly, I would again date it back to the transition -- he understands that he's the President for every American.  And he's talked consistently about having a united country.  And you do that by bringing people together, whether or not they agree with you on every issue, or one or two issues.  But if there's common ground that can be found to move the country forward, then great.  And I think so many of the President's priority issues are issues that Ohio is dealing with and that he wants to make sure that he can continue to work with Governor Kasich so that every American benefits.\nApril.\nQ    Did Kasich ask for the meeting?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    Okay, what did the President gain from his tour today?  You talked about where he visited, the exhibits that he visited.  Did he also visit slavery?  And the reason why I'm asking is, is because when he was candidate Trump, he said things like \"we made this country,\" meaning white America, and not necessarily black.  Did he gain --\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know why you would say that.  What do you mean?\nQ    No, no, no, he said that.  I heard him say that.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, but look -- the answer to your question is -- one of the first exhibits that he visited was one of the slavery exhibits.  And the director walked him through some very amazing stories and statistics about where slavery was prevailing, not just in traditional Southern colonies but throughout the country.  So they did have a very robust discussion about slavery early on in the tour.\nAnd I think that it was a very eye-opening and powerful tour for him, and, frankly, for every American.  And I would encourage any American that can find the time and get in, because it's so popular.  But it really is enlightening as far as parts of our history that people may not fully appreciate or know, and the contributions and the sacrifices that so many Americans have made that are a critical piece to our history that sometimes don’t get the attention they deserve.\nSo I think the President walked away from there -- and I mentioned in the remarks that he mentioned to Lonnie that he wanted to come back, because you can't do it justice.  And it's much like the Holocaust Museum where you go through it once and then you sit there and start thinking of all the things that you saw, and think, you know, I'd like to go back and more fully explore what I saw because it piqued some degree of interest or intellectual curiosity.\nBut he was very taken aback.  It’s a very, very powerful institution and tour, and it covers a lot of ground.  I think he was really proud to share it with Dr. Carson.  I mean, when you walk through that museum and you see all of the elements of our history, when you walk up to this one glass exhibit that is Dr. Carson's scrubs and pictures of him, and to experience that with him and his wife for the first time, and you realize how amazing that is for any American to be part of a Smithsonian, and you're standing with Dr. Carson and his wife where he is experiencing it with you for the first time and how powerful that must have been was, I think, a real interesting opportunity for him to sit there, hand to hand, with another American and watch them be part of American history.  And you also appreciate some of the real contributions that Dr. Carson has made to medicine and the depth and breadth of his accomplishments.\nQ    And lastly, kind of putting this with the next question, is there any advancement on the CBC meeting with the President?  And also, the head of the CBC said he was wondering if the President saw anything from current and past members of the CBC while he was in the museum, to get a little bit of information on them before this meeting happens.\nMR. SPICER:  I'll have further updates on that.  I know the President looks forward to that meeting, and I think that we're in the process of trying to begin setting that up.  And so I'll have further updates on that once we get closer.  I know that we've got some additional work before the month concludes on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and some meetings that we're working on with them.  But I want to get them locked in before I go further.\nQ    What did he think about the members that he saw in the museum?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, when you walk through one of them, there's a big jumbotron, and we paused for a while, and John Lewis was there giving a very powerful speech.  And we just paused and watched that for a little while.  So, again, I think that, respectfully, when you walk through a museum like this there's a lot of moments where you're just stopping and taking it in, and there's -- if you haven’t been there, you walk up this one ramp and they stop and there's two big screens, and one of them is a video screen, and it's a massive jumbotron --\nQ    The civil rights --\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And we watched the video of John Lewis talking there and describing his efforts in championing voting and civil rights.\nSo I know the President paused and watched it and listened to it.  And again, I would just go back to how he described his overall -- we didn’t dissect the different things, but I watched him and it was a very powerful experience for him, and I know he looks forward to going back.\nHallie.\nQ    Sean, two questions for you.  First one on undocumented immigrants.  You just made very clear that the President's priority is to deport those who pose a threat to public safety.\nMR. SPICER:  Correct.\nQ    I know you're familiar with the case in Arizona of the mother, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos.  Is she a threat to this country?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm going to leave that up to ICE.  We don’t get involved from the White House to particular cases.  That's not --\nQ    But she's a symbol --\nMR. SPICER:  You're right, and I understand.\nQ    But is she a threat to public safety, though?\nMR. SPICER:  But, Hallie, I think the answer is, is that ICE determined that she had violated the law in a way that was in accordance with this.  Again, we've got to go back to this idea that our job, especially here at the White House, isn’t to call balls and strikes and say, well, this person only violated part of the law, or let them go on this.\nIf this was any other subject, if this was tax evasion and we said, well, they only really violated a little bit of -- they only cheated on their taxes a little, you wouldn’t be saying hey, should they really be going to be prison or should they be getting a fine?  At some point, laws are laws.  And if people have a problem with the law, whether it's at the local, state or federal issue, then we should petition our lawmakers and the executive at that particular branch of government and change it.  But our job shouldn’t be to figure out should this individual not have to abide by the law, should this individual get a pass.  If we want to change the law, we've got a very amazing process here in this country to both create and change laws.\nAnd so I don’t want to comment on the specifics of any one case because I think that then puts the White House in a position of deciding who is following the law and who isn’t, and who should get a pass.  The bottom --\nQ    But isn’t it different from you just said of prioritization of cases?  There's a difference --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, there's a difference.  When you have 13 or 14 million people, they're in the country -- you know, I think it's one thing to say prioritize people who pose a threat to public safety and go after this individual or that individual, or whatever.  There's no question, you have to have priorities in anything -- what do you do first, what do you do second, what do you do third.  And when you're talking about, 13, 14, 15, potentially more, millions of people in this country, the President needed to give guidance, especially after what they went through in the last administration where there were so many carve-outs that ICE agents and CBP members had to figure out each individual whether or not they fit in a particular category and they could adjudicate that case.  The President wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies and say:  You have a mission, there are laws that need to be followed; you should do your mission and follow the law.  And for specific cases, I would refer you to ICE in particular and do that.\nQ    Sean, where did you get the 13 and 14 million number?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, Hallie is on number two.\nQ    Thank you.\nQ    The 13, 14 million number -- where did you get that number?\nMR. SPICER:  Glenn, will you please not interrupt her?\nQ    Do you want to take that now?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, I think -- I'm not going to allow you to be interrupted.\nQ    So the second question is on the anti-Semitism comments that you referenced from the podium, the President made very clear.  You said, though, that he has taken opportunities in the past.  Just last week, though, he had the opportunities to deliver a message to the American people about anti-Semitism.  He made very clear he was not anti-Semitic and he was, in fact, insulted by that.  But as far as a broader message to the American people, he declined to offer one.   Is the President comfortable with his obligation as the leader of this country to deliver that kind of broad and forceful message to Americans?  And if so, why didn’t he do it sooner in the case of these attacks?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the idea, Hallie, that -- he has.  And I think there's a point at which he talked literally on election night about uniting this country and making sure that all Americans, et cetera.  And every time there's an instance, it's interesting -- I mean, I get a question, \"Is he going to denounce this one, is he going to denounce this one?\"  At some point, the question is asked and answered.  He has stood very forcefully against --\nQ    That's not what I'm asking.  I'm not asking --\nMR. SPICER:  What are you --\nQ    I'm asking, is he comfortable with his role as the person who needs to be delivering a broader message to America, not denouncing it, which he did clearly today.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And I think that he is very comfortable and understands that as the leader of the free world, the President of this country, the Commander-in-Chief, that he has an awesome responsibility to make it very clear where we're going as a country and what our values are, and that he has spoken very forcefully that we don’t stand for this kind of behaviors, and words, and intolerance, that we are a country that should bring people together and that we shouldn’t tolerate people who are hating on individuals because of their gender or because of their religion or the color of their skin, or a variety of other things, but that there's a point at which it's asked and answered.\nAnd I think the President has been very clear over and over again, going back through the campaign, the transition and now, that that's the kind of President that he wants to be, that's the kind of country that he wants to lead.\nTrey.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Following the DHS memos this morning, the ACLU said the courts won't allow these orders to become a reality.  How is the administration preparing for another potential legal battle?  And do you have any response to the ACLU?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think we have done a phenomenal job of working with the various departments, particularly DHS and DOJ, State, and through the White House staff, to make sure that we are well within any concerns that the court might have.\nAnd as I mentioned, I think it's important to continue to emphasize we feel as though the first one did that as well, and we were vindicated several times in the court.  We have an issue with the 9th Circuit and I think we will overcome that, ultimately, on the merits.  But in the meantime, a dual-track is something that we wanted to pursue to make sure that we do everything we can, as I mentioned before, to keep the country safe.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  The Australian foreign minister is here today, meeting the Vice President.\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry, say that again.\nQ    The Australian foreign minister is meeting the Vice President today and also the Secretary of State tomorrow.  I guess we can assume that the U.S.-Australia refugee deal will come up.  Now, last time we spoke, the President was still considering and reviewing a deal.  Can you just update us on what the current position is?\nMR. SPICER:  We'll have a readout of that.\nQ    And just --\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, of course everyone gets two.  (Laughter.)\nQ    If you could just update us on the current position on the deal.  And also, given that recent exposure on the President's distaste for it, will Australia be expected to return the favor?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, again, I would wait.  We'll have a readout after that call as far as what they discussed.  But I've got nothing -- I don't want to get ahead of the Vice President's meeting with either the Secretary of State or the Vice President.\nKristen.\nQ    Thank you.  I have two questions.  One, on the immigration refugee executive order that we're expecting in the coming days, so that it withstands legal challenges, can you tell us what the language might look like as it relates to Syrian refugees?\nMR. SPICER:  I appreciate the effort, but when we have it ready we'll get it out.  And I think part of this is --\nQ    (Inaudible) ban on Syrian refugees?\nMR. SPICER:  Excuse me?  Again, I appreciate the second try, but we're not ready to announce it.  And part of it is, is that we're making sure that it is completely ready to go.  And so when we have that, we will get it out to you.  And I would just -- the reason that we haven't announced it is it's not ready to be announced.\nQ    I want to try one more on --\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.\nQ    -- the comments that the President made today about anti-Semitism.  In terms of the timing, obviously he was asked about it, but they also came after his daughter, Ivanka, sent out that tweet.  Has she counseled him?  Was she one of the people saying it's important for you to forcefully denounce this?  Why today?\nMR. SPICER:  Because the President was visiting the African American Museum, he wanted to make it very clear.  I think it was very powerful that, while there, and while understanding the struggles of so many -- and we talk about how one of the beauties of history is that we don't repeat itself.  And I think that when you're at a museum like that and seeing the struggles that so many Americans faced and overcame, that you want to remind people that there is still issues that our country is grappling with and that there is no place for that hate and for that language.\nAnd I think -- as I mentioned, it was a very powerful opportunity for him to say that and to make clear, again, what his opinions were.\nQ    Does he regret not doing it last week, Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry?\nQ    Does he regret not stating this comment last week?\nMR. SPICER:  The President was very clear.  That was a very -- I think, as I mentioned to Hallie, he has discussed this over and over again.  I think there's a point to which his position is abundantly clear.  His attempts and his desire and his rhetoric to unite the country has been expressed over and over again.\nSarah.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  The New York Times is reporting that Trump's budget director is preparing a budget that eliminates the Export-Import Bank.  But several lawmakers, including Senator Heitkamp, have come out of private meetings with President Trump and said that in those private meetings he expressed support for the export bank.  So which is it?  Does he support Ex-Im or does he support eliminating it?\nMR. SPICER:  I can confirm that the OMB director -- the budget director is working on a budget.  (Laughter.)  Beyond that, I'm not going to get ahead of the OMB director right now.  They are drafting a budget, they are talking to members of Congress and other interested parties about funding levels and such, but we're not at a position to go yet.\nYes.\nQ    Sean, just wanted to circle on Alexis's question.  Since the DHS guidance did not eliminate DACA, does that mean that the program is remaining in place, that it's a settled matter and it's not going away?\nMR. SPICER:  No, Jordan.  What it means is that this particular enforcement is tailored to what I have been referencing over and over again -- that what we're talking about today is the implementation of those two executive orders, one specifically that's tasking the agencies under DHS to address a very specific problem of the million or so, plus or minus, people that they have identified, that they have then adjudicated with already going through the process to be adjudicated and taken out of the country.\nQ    That means a decision on DACA could come any day.\nMR. SPICER:  That's right, exactly.  It just means that this -- what it means, more than anything, is that this order does not address that and it's very clear in the Q&A -- and, again, I would refer you back to DHS's website that has all of that.\nGoyal.\nQ    Thank you very much.  Two questions please.  One, it's been one month on the job for you and for the President, and you are already talk of the town around the globe.  (Laughter.)  My two questions are, one --\nMR. SPICER:  My wife would disagree with you.  (Laughter.)  It's not always positive, too.\nQ    It looks like, Sean, that the President's order is working at least around the globe because more than 60,000 Pakistanis have been deported by Saudi Arabia.  But they're saying that they were illegals and also they're a threat to the country.  And also, at the same time, Pakistani government is arresting hundreds of terrorists inside the country.  Any presidential message?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I'm not going to -- there's nothing that I have in terms of an update of what's going on in Pakistan.  I would refer you to the Department of State with respect to specific policies.  But the broader point that you're making is I think each country needs to look at what they need to do to control the people that are entering their country and keep their people safe.\nWhen you look at our laws in particular, and compare them to so many other countries around the globe, we actually tend to probably fall in the lower end of how tough our immigration policies are vis-à-vis someone else.\nQ    Sean, my second question.\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry.\nQ    As far as illegal immigrants are concerned in the U.S., millions of illegal immigrants that were waiting for the last eight or ten years that they might see a light in the dark tunnel, and now they’re hoping that President Trump will have a light for them.  So what is the President’s message for them who are in this country for five, 10, 15 or 20 years but they’re not -- they don’t have any criminal records?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, look, the President has said before he’s got a big heart.  And I think that as we continue to develop policy on immigration, it’s going to be, as we’ve talked about in the past, prioritized -- what we go after first, second third.  The President has made very clear he understands the plight of some of those individuals.  He’s got a big heart.  He understands the impact it has on many families, many communities.\nBut we will continue to develop policies that will address that.  And again, today’s focus is specifically on those two executive orders, and I’m going to limit it to that.\nQ    Sean, at the beginning of the month, Senator John McCain sent a letter to the President requesting that the administration provide arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists within their country.  When will the President respond to Senator McCain’s letter?  And what is the administration’s position on lethal aid to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t have anything for you on that.  I’ll try to get back to you on that.  I know that we’re very pleased to watch Senator McCain praise the pick of General McMaster.  That’s obviously someone that we will consult with.  But we were pleased to see so much support for him.\nScott Newman (ph).\nQ    On Russia -- critics of the President have said that at time he doesn’t talk tough enough on the subject.  General McMaster, though, has been labeled by a lot of people as being pretty hawkish.  I’m curious what, if any, difference in tone or tenor or strategy we should expect now that they’re working together.\nQ    Well, I think, as I mentioned a couple times, I think there is widespread praise for General McMaster and his understanding and command of national security matters, foreign policy matters.  He’s going to be a great asset to the President’s national security team.\nBut ultimately, the President has always been the decider, whether it’s Russia or any other issue.  And I think you’re right, he has made it very clear that if he can get a deal with Russia, something that the last several administrations have tried to do, that he’s going to do it.  And if he can’t, he won’t.  But he is going to try.  And I think his success as a businessman and negotiator should be seen as a positive sign for him to be able to do that.\nBut he understands that if he can find common ground on defeating ISIS and combatting terrorism, growing the economy where we can find areas of economic interest, then we’re going to do it.  But that’s where we’re going to continue to work with Russia if we can.  He’ll get a deal.  If he can’t, he won’t.  But he’s going to try.  And I think where others have failed, he’s going to make sure that he does everything possible to make sure that if it’s in the interest of the United States he will get a deal.\nQ    I have another question on General McMaster.  So how much leeway is he going to get to restructure, to bring on his own people?  There were some reports that Admiral Harward was not allowed to, or others as well.  So can you address that?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  I can.  He will have 100 percent.  The President has been very, very clear with that.  He is the National Security Advisor, and he will have whatever he needs to implement a successful team.\nBut with respect to Admiral Harward that you brought up, Admiral Harward made it very, very clear that he wanted this job, he would love to take it.  He was impressed with the team.  But during the course of discussions, it came up -- he said: Before I continue with this discussion, I need to address some financial and family concerns.  He went back, he came back to us and said, I am unable to continue the discussions because of there’s some financial concerns and some family issues that we have.  I spent 40 years serving this country in the United States Navy.\nI talked to him again Saturday night, and he said:  If there’s another opening in a year or two, I would be honored, I am so impressed with the team that’s there.\nAnd I would urge people to actually talk to him.  He was so excited about being part of the team.  He was available to as many reporters as he could take.  We gave out his information -- his contact information.  And he’s been very clear.  He wrote a letter to the President prior to -- first thing Tuesday morning.  He was in the UAE, he sent the letter over and we had it first thing in the morning, where he said, because of family concerns, because of some financial constraints, having served this nation for 40 years, I can’t take this job, but I'm unbelievably impressed.\nAll of the rumors about the discretion that he would have over staff or any other thing were 100 percent false.  He's made it clear that he would love to serve in the future, that he was impressed with the team, that he wanted to do this.  There were just some constraints financially and family-wise that come with -- or after having served 40 years in the military, sacrifices both financially and family-wise that he had had to make.\nBut I talked to him several times, and the team has talked to him.  But ultimately, the President was very, very impressed with General McMaster.  He had always been one of the individuals that he thought stood above so many other folks.  He was impressed with the entire list, John Bolton and others.  But so many people had spoken to him.  General Mattis, Tom Cotton, other senators really praised General McMaster's command of the issues, his management, his style, his understanding of the geopolitical landscape.  And I think that's why you saw such amazing widespread bipartisan praise for him, and why he will be such an asset to the national security team.  So, ultimately, we ended up with the best choice.  And I think that's going to benefit not just this administration but our entire nation.\nQ    Sean, can we expect him to get anyone else from the top of -- any senior people at the NSC?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm sorry?\nQ    Can we expect that he may replace any others in the NSC?\nMR. SPICER:  Again, I just can't be any clearer.  I think that we've got an amazing team.  He's been impressed with them.  But the President has, as he did with other candidates, told them that they would lead the team and that he would have the discretion of it.\nJeff.\nQ    I just wanted to follow on that.  You said that he has the full authority to structure his office as he sees fit.  Does that extend to the principals committee, as well?  After he comes in and takes a look at the whole apparatus, if he advises the President and he would prefer not to have the chief strategist as a member of the principals committee, would the President --\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President has made clear to him he's got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants.  Obviously, with something like that, he would come to the President and make that recommendation.  But the President would take that under serious consideration.  I don’t want to go ahead with this person or that person or structure, but the President made it very clear with him and the other candidates that they had 100 percent control and authority over the national security committee.\nThank you, guys.  I'll see you tomorrow.\nQ    Will McMaster have to retire?  Can you clarify that?\nMR. SPICER:  No, he will stay on active duty.\nQ    Does that require Senate confirmation then?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  He will stay on active duty.  That was the case with Powell and I think some other folks.\nQ    One more clarification just before you go.  So when the new EO comes out, you won't rescind the original one and you'll leave it in place?\nMR. SPICER:  That's correct.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.\nEND\n2:41 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-02-21T00:00:00", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/21/2017, #13"}

EST\nMS. SANDERS:  Seems very formal here.  (Laughter.)  I'll keep it pretty short today.  I'm going to walk through a couple of things and then I'll take some questions.\nFirst of all, the President has had an extremely busy day today.  He has been in a number of meetings and quite a few calls, and also a lot of staff briefings and other meetings.  A couple big ones of note that you would probably find interesting:  He did several interviews and in-depth meetings that are still ongoing as of this afternoon, talking to different candidates for the National Security Advisor position.  Among those people, as of today, that he met with:  McMaster, Bolton, Caslen and Kellogg, and we may have some additional meetings and names tomorrow, and may also meet with a couple of those people again.\nThere's also an in-depth meeting on Obamacare.  Secretary Price, Mulvaney, Chief of Staff Priebus, Bannon, Seema Verma, and quite a few members of the domestic policy staff also were part of that meeting.  And they discussed Obamacare repeal-and-replace strategy, and that went on for several hours.  He was not there for the entirety of the meeting.\nQ    Was everyone at Mar-a-Lago?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes.\nQ    They all flew down?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes.\nQ    That was all in Mar-a-Lago?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes.  I do believe that a couple of the people from that group also went over to the golf club, as well, for a brief period of time.\nQ    You said he wasn’t there for the whole several hours?\nMS. SANDERS:  Correct.\nQ    But for part --\nMS. SANDERS:  Correct.  And remember I'll get to the questions section here momentarily.\nHe's had several foreign leader calls today, including with the President of Panama, where they talked about U.S. investment and private sector presence.  He also did a second foreign leader call with the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, where they talked about terrorism and other security challenges, including foreign fighters being the primary point of focus on those calls.  And we'll have more detailed readouts for both of those later this evening.\nI know there have been quite a few questions about his comments about Sweden last night.  I'll address that now as a group so we don’t have to have 75 emails to address it.  He was talking about rise in crime and recent incidents in general, not referring to a specific issue.\nQ    I'm sorry, it's going too fast.  Can you just say that again?\nMS. SANDERS:  Sure.  He was talking about rise in crime and recent incidents in general, and not referring to a specific incident.\nAs I said earlier, he's going to continue several meetings throughout the evening, including additional meetings with National Security Advisor candidates.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nQ    On Sweden, where did he get the information about the rise in crime?  Was it from that Fox segment on Friday night?\nMS. SANDERS:  I believe he may have seen that, but I also know there have been a number of reports of rise in crime and specific incidents that have taken place over the last several weeks.\nQ    And also, why then did the President specifically say \"last night\"?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t think that was meant to be last night.  I think he was just referring to, again, in general.  I had a chance to get that clarified, and he wasn’t speaking about a specific incident the night before, but about rise in crime in general.\nQ    So he misspoke?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, yeah -- I think he was referring to a report he had seen the previous night that spoke specifically to that topic.\nQ    Was that a report from Fox News?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t know.\nQ    Sarah, you said that there may be more interviews tomorrow.  Can you tell us who those names would be?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not at this time.  We don’t have any further details on those yet.\nQ    And do you have any updates on his timeline for making the decision?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know he hopes to make it soon.  I would think in the next few days.\nQ    Can you clarify whether Ray Odierno is one of the potential candidates?\nMS. SANDERS:  We don’t have any further names to release right now.\nQ    There's been some reporting about a memo signed by Kelly, draft memos on new guidelines for detaining and deporting immigrants.  Can you talk at all about those?  And is there anything particular in the documents that the White House is objecting to?\nMS. SANDERS:  Right now those are nothing more than draft memos.  There are still a lot of conversations that are taking place.  The final documents haven’t been completed.  And we expect that to happen in the next couple of days, and we'll roll that out at that time.\nQ    That's on the immigration executive order?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes.\nQ    Or is it on the --\nMS. SANDERS:  Are you talking about the travel EOs?\nQ    No, I was talking specifically about the guidelines signed by Kelly about deporting illegal immigrants.\nMS. SANDERS:  Those are also draft EOs, both sets.  I know there have been multiple versions floating around.\nQ    These are the ones about hiring more enforcement agents.\nMS. SANDERS:  None of those are final and have not been signed off by the White House.\nQ    But are they an accurate reflection of where the policy is headed when it rises to the level where the Secretary signs it?\nMS. SANDERS:  Some components are.  But again, those haven’t even made it to the White House.  And so for that to be a final version is just not accurate.\nQ    And just to clarify again, that's about --\nMS. SANDERS:  There's multiple sets of EOs.  None of them are final.  They are all in draft form.\nQ    And what EOs can we expect this week?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t have any specific announcements about it at this time, but I think you can expect the travel EO -- the revised travel immigration one to be in the next couple of days.\nQ    Can you say a little bit more about the Obamacare meeting -- like, who all was there; specifically how long they met; what exactly they were talking about, and if they were looping in members of Congress or it was just a White House-centric strategy?\nMS. SANDERS:  There weren’t members of Congress that were present today.  There were a handful of domestic policy advisors from the White House, Secretary Price, Mulvaney.  I know several members of senior staff, Chief of Staff Priebus, Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner were all present for that meeting.\nQ    Can you tell us more what it was?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, it was primarily a strategy meeting about laying out the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nQ    Any response regarding Senator McCain's comments this morning that he's very concerned about the membership of the National Security Council, specifically Steve Bannon?\nMS. SANDERS:  I'm not going to respond to Senator McCain's comments.\nQ    When the President is interviewing these candidates for National Security Advisor, how much of this is simply about him vetting the candidates himself, getting a sense of what they bring to the position, versus the candidates seeking assurances about the ability to set their own staff and other aspects of the job?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think we've made it pretty clear that whoever takes this position will have full authority on the staffing component.  I know Chief of Staff Priebus addressed that this morning on the Sunday shows.  And I don’t know if there's anything further in that realm that you want to look for, but in terms of staffing they'll have full authority to make those decisions.\nQ    And the President indicated to us yesterday that his timeline is in a matter of days.  Beyond the interviews that are happening this weekend, is there anything that could happen at the White House?  Or could an announcement come before he leaves here?\nMS. SANDERS:  Your speculation on that is probably as good as mine.  I think it could be probably anytime in the next couple of days.\nQ    Sarah, was the President golfing this morning?  And who was he golfing with?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know he played a couple of holes this morning, but I'm not going to disclose any of the others that were there.\nQ    And yesterday as well?\nMS. SANDERS:  I do believe he played a couple of holes yesterday.\nQ    A couple as in two, or --\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t think it was a full round, if that's what you're asking.\nQ    And on the four names you identified, you said some meetings have happened and some additional would be tonight?  Would those be repeat?\nMS. SANDERS:  Some are ongoing right now while we're here.\nQ    Repeat meetings?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not repeat meetings tonight, but they're ongoing as I'm standing here.\nQ    So this first round of four goes into this evening?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes, correct.\nQ    And just to clarify, they're all face-to-face?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes.\nQ    So they're just here at Mar-a-Lago?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes, correct.\nQ    Four finalists -- that's it?\nMS. SANDERS:  As of right now.  And I said -- remember -- there could be additional names and additional meetings as early as tomorrow.\nQ    There have been a couple of reports about administration staffers who have been fired or left their jobs after criticizing the President.  One was at HUD; I believe it was the chief of staff.  And there's another report today about an NSC aide, Craig Deare, who left his job after harsh criticism of Trump.  Is it fair to say that -- I mean, are government employees allowed to criticize the President?\nMS. SANDERS:  He was just sent back to his original position, so he wasn’t fired.\nQ    Who --\nMS. SANDERS:  Craig Deare.\nQ    More broadly, do government employees need to be concerned that they are not allowed to criticize the President or they can lose their job?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, I don’t think that any person that is there in order to carry out the President's agenda should be against the President's agenda.  It seems pretty silly that you would have somebody that's not supportive of what you're trying to accomplish there to carry out that very thing.\nQ    What about somebody who in the past was against the President's agenda?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, I think if you don’t support the President's agenda, it would be very hard for you to take a position where your very job is to carry out and help him accomplish that agenda.  If they're not onboard with specific pieces of his agenda -- for instance, if you didn’t want to help create jobs in the way of cutting regulations, then it would be really silly for him to bring you in to be part of like an economic task force.\nQ    Sarah, is this test contributing to the administration's, so far, so few jobs -- so few Senate-confirmed jobs being nominated for, whether it be deputy secretaries from a number of Cabinet agencies, below dep-sec level?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think one of the biggest problems that we've had is the obstruction by Democrats.  It's really hard to put in the secondary staff when you don’t have the leader in that office.  If you can't confirm a Secretary, you can't really start filling out the second and third positions in a lot of those agencies, and if, by comparison to past administrations, there's not that big of a gap between what we have and what they have at this point in time.\nQ    But even in terms of -- not in terms of nominees for the secretaries who are confirmed, what's the timeline then?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, and a lot of those have just been confirmed over the last week.  So, again, that's a moving process, and we're continuing to add and grow staff every day.\nQ    What was the job that Mr. Deare was sent back to?\nMS. SANDERS:  I'll have to double-check, but I have it, I just don’t want to tell you the wrong thing.  I don’t have it right in front of me.\nQ    Has the President followed Vice President Pence's trip overseas at all?  And what's his reaction to his sort of debut on the world stage?\nMS. SANDERS:  He has.  And they've spoken several times over the past several days.  I know that both the Vice President and the President have talked to each other, as well as their staffs have both talked back and forth, and very happy with how everything is going so far.\nQ    Can you tell us more about how you would disagree with the President if you're in a position?  You said that if a person doesn’t agree with his agenda, they shouldn’t have a job.  But some people I'm sure disagree with certain policies.  How does that work?\nMS. SANDERS:  I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth on the variation of disagreement that you might be able to have in order to have a job.  I think the broader point here is if you don’t support the President's agenda, you shouldn’t have a job in the White House.\nQ    I mean, administration-wide, though, we're talking about.  Are you extending that to various department agencies?\nMS. SANDERS:  I'm not extending like a blanket policy here.  I just am saying that if you do not support the agenda and you're not there to help carry it through, then you shouldn’t be part of the administration.\nQ    The report that the immigrant draft EO that's been going around that shows the same seven countries, but exemptions for travelers who already have a visa, is that where that policy is at right now?  Is that an accurate reflection of where you guys are going?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, that's not final.  There's still a lot of moving parts there.  And until it's final, I don’t want to get into the details.\nQ    On the NSC, one of the reasons that we were told that Harward didn’t want to take the job was the fact that he couldn’t bring in all of his own team.\nMS. SANDERS:  That's inaccurate information.\nQ    In these interviews, are the candidates being told they can bring on their own team?  Or are the deputies who are currently there going to stay?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know it's been made clear that they can bring on their own team, and so that's inaccurate information that you have.\nQ    So the candidates.  And how involved is Pence in Trump's interviews and deciding who the NSC director will be?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t know his specific involvement, but I know that he and the President have spoken about it.\nQ    Leon Panetta today said that there has been no convening of the National Security Council in the Trump White House.  Is that accurate?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not to my knowledge.  I don’t believe that's accurate.  But I'll double-check and verify that for you.\nQ    Let me ask you, on a slightly separate topic, we're just looking to confirm a trade story that was in the Wall Street Journal that says the administration is considering changes that would make the trade gap look larger than in past years, and that it would -- one idea would include excluding from the U.S. any exports -- any items imported to the country and then transferring them to another country, like Mexico or Canada.  Can you comment on the story?\nMS. SANDERS:  I saw your question on that, and I'm checking it and getting clarification.  I'll let you all know once we have it.\nQ    Can you tell us about last night when the President attended the cancer fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago?  We weren’t told about it.  Can you tell us a little bit about it?\nMS. SANDERS:  He did attend.  He and the First Lady were both present at the gala.  It's something they've gone to every year, I believe for the last 10 years.  They had dinner and then stopped by the event.\nQ    Who did he talk to and who did he sit with there?  Is it true he sat with Prime Minister Mulroney?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think he talked with quite a few people there.  I believe there were over 800 attendees, and so I think he talked to quite a few of them.  I don’t know all the names of each person.\nQ    Prime Minister Mulroney was at his table, is that right?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know that they did have an exchange.  I don’t know if they were actually seated together.\nQ    I know Reince confirmed this morning that the White House was aware of this request from the intelligence committee to preserve documents related to Russia.  Can you describe how those efforts are underway already?  Is the White House Counsel distributing information to make sure that staff are aware of this and doing their best to preserve the documents?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know that there have been instructions to preserve all documents.  But specific to that, I don’t have guidance, but I can see if we have something specific for that and let you know.\nOne more question, anybody?  Last one.  All right, she got in first.  Last one.\nQ    There have been a lot of reports about the number of people who are coming down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with the President, talk with the President.  Do taxpayers pay for flying everyone down here, all the NSA candidates and the people he's meeting for for the Obamacare roundtables?  And any idea how many people that would be over the last couple of weekends?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t know the exact number of people that have been here, and I don’t have a comment on the specifics of each individual travel.\nQ    And along the lines of Mar-a-Lago, there's been concern that people who bought membership to the club, which is now $200,000 up front, are getting special access to the President and his staff that other people don’t get.  What's the administration's response to that?\nMS. SANDERS:  Look, I think this President is extremely accessible to most of America.  I think that's why he went out and did a rally last night, why he did a press conference earlier this week, why he comes back on the plane and talks to you guys.  I think this is the most accessible President that I've certainly ever seen, and I don’t think that that's an issue across the board.  I think he is in touch with regular Americans every single day, and, again, is very transparent and accessible across the board.\nThanks, guys.\nQ    Do you have a week ahead, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not yet, but I think we will later tonight.\nQ    And tomorrow, what time is he going back?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t know yet.  I think we're waiting to see some of the meetings that may take place tomorrow.\nThanks, guys.\nEND\n4:50 P.M.

EST\nMS. SANDERS:  I'll read a little bit, give you guys a quick update.  Clearly, I'm not Sean, but hopefully you guys will treat me just as nicely as you do him every week.\nFirst, I'd like to say the President was pleased to see that the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, was confirmed by the Senate today.  Administrator Pruitt will be essential in the President's plan to restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and water clean and safe.  In this administration, the EPA will no longer spend unnecessary taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control, anti-energy agenda.  The President is glad to finally have him officially onboard.\nAs you know, we just came from Boeing, where the President talked jobs with company executives and celebrated the rollout of the amazing 787-10 Dreamliner.  That airplane is an incredible example of what American ingenuity and initiative can create.  President Trump is committed to unleashing U.S. businesses so that we can create, imagine, inventive -- and building in this country again.\nUnder the President's ambitious jobs plan, American industry will come roaring back.  He's already started ending job-killing regulations and will be working to lower taxes on American businesses, and the results are already on their way.  From Intel's incredible announcement last week to automakers keeping and bringing back thousands of jobs, businesses across the country are responding to the President's pro-growth plans.\nThe trip to Boeing is the perfect cap on a week of tremendous progress on the President's economic agenda.  And just yesterday, he signed House Joint Resolution 38, nullifying the job-killing stream-protection rule, which went into effect on the very last day of the Obama administration.  This rule was just the left again imposing an anti-American energy agenda on the people without considering the significant cost.  It took power away from state and local governments in order to grow the federal bureaucracy, ignoring the extremely negative impact it would have on hardworking Americans and their families, and the support by putting upward pressure on energy costs.\nPresident Trump is committed to ending the previous administration's war on coal, which is really a war on our coal miners.  An October, 2015 economic analysis by the National Mining Association found that this rule jeopardizes as many as 280,000 jobs.  Rolling back this rule is a significant step towards fulfilling the President's promise to restore America's coal-mining industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports.  The President is bringing back jobs at both the plant and mine level, and the spirit of optimism rising across this country is only going to grow as the President signs more and more bills just like this one.\nJust look at the stock market, which hit record numbers this week, due to a surge in optimism in the business world and spurred by anticipation of the President's impending pro-growth agenda.  These sentiments were echoed during the President's meeting on Wednesday with a group of CEOs from some of America's largest retailers.  The retail sector supports roughly 42 million jobs, according to the National Retail Federal, more than any other sector of the economy.  It's also saddled with some of the most burdensome tax and regulations of any industry.  President Trump's pro-growth tax and regulatory reform plans will simplify our tax code and lower rates for hardworking Americans and their companies.\nRetail leaders thank the President for hosting them at the White House and noted that they were optimistic about the future, because no previous President had ever been so willing to hear from them directly on the issues that impact their business and customers.  The President pledged to take appropriate action in the executive branch to address their concerns and to work closely with congressional leaders to pass legislation that will help create a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans.\nTomorrow, the President will be back in front of the people at a rally at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport.\nQ    Where is it -- the international airport?\nMS. SANDERS:  President Trump, just as he did so effectively throughout the campaign, is going to continue taking his message directly to the American people.  I know he’s looking forward to being back in Florida, a state that holds a special place in his heart, where the winter White House is, as well as a place that was so instrumental in his historic electoral victory in November.\nAnd with that, I’ll take a few of your questions.\nQ    Sarah, can you talk about the expectations this weekend, in terms of who he’s going to meet with to fulfill the role of the national security advisor?\nMS. SANDERS:  We don’t have any announcements at this time, but I know that obviously that’s something the President takes very seriously, and wants to make sure he’s got the right person in the job.\nQ    Who is he considering?\nMS. SANDERS:  Again, we don’t have any announcements or specific details to release at this time.\nQ    Can you give us a sense of his timetable?  We know he had hoped to try to fill this position by today.  That’s obvious it’s not going to happen, but do -- is the expectation within the next two days?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don't know if we have a specific timetable, but if we do, I’ll get back to you on it.\nQ    Are you thinking about redefining the job or changing the job description to make it more appealing, or to make sure that people that it’s offered to will take it?\nMS. SANDERS:  Not to my knowledge, but, again, I can check on that.\nQ    While the President was at Boeing, did he express his commitment to funding the Ex-Im Bank?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don’t know if that was specifically addressed.  Are you talking about in the private meeting?\nQ    Yeah.\nMS. SANDERS:  Yeah, I’m not sure if that was specifically addressed.  I wasn’t in the room for the private meeting.\nQ    Generally, does he support funding the Ex-Im Bank?\nMS. SANDERS:  You know, I think that’s a question that I’ll let him answer down the line.\nQ    Sarah, the President yesterday said that he was going to be reintroducing the executive order -- a different version of the executive order on immigration and refugees.  What is the White House doing differently this time around to ensure that the new order could withstand any legal challenge?\nMS. SANDERS:  The President was pretty specific yesterday when he talked about it in terms of that it would match and address the concerns that were part of the legal complications it ran into previously.\nQ    Are different people involved?  Is there a different sign-off process -- anything like that?\nMS. SANDERS:  No, I mean, again, all of the people that needed to know the last time, that would be part of this process, would be involved in this process again.\nQ    Has the President seen a complete order at this point?\nMS. SANDERS:   I don't know if an order is finalized, but I know they’re working on it and expect to have that at the first part of next week.\nQ    Has he looked at it in progress, or will he wait until it’s finalized in its proposed form to take a look at it?\nMS. SANDERS:  I know the President has been involved in the process, but I don't know if he has seen the most up-to-date version.\nQ    Sarah, can you say if the administration has ever considered having the National Guard help round up undocumented immigrants?\nMS. SANDERS:  The President and the White House have never had that as part of any plan to use the National Guard in any capacity for that.\nQ    Why did Kelly draft this memo?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m sorry?\nQ    Why did Kelly draft this memo if that was never considered?\nMS. SANDERS:  Secretary Kelly?\nQ    Yeah.\nMS. SANDERS:  Secretary Kelly did not draft that memo.\nQ    We’re now on day 28 --\nQ    Who drafted it then?  Wait, who drafted it?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware of the specific person, but I know that it wasn’t Secretary Kelly, or at his direction.\nQ    We’re now -- you know, the President was inaugurated four weeks ago today.  Why does he feel the need tomorrow to go back onto the stump?  And what should we expect to hear from him tomorrow?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think it’s real simple the reason he wants to go back.  I think, in large part, it’s because his message, when filtered through -- unfortunately, people standing in this circle don’t always do the best job delivering his message, and nobody does it better than he does.  And so, he can do that very easily by taking the stage and talking directly to the people of America, addressing their concerns, and being able to properly express exactly what he’s doing, what his administration has done over the last month, and what they plan to do in the coming weeks.\nQ    Is this a campaign rally for 2020?  Or is it a campaign rally for another candidate?  Or how do you portray it?\nMS. SANDERS:  I think it’s most likely a campaign rally for America.  I think it’s -- again, it’s the President’s time to be able to speak directly to people across this country in an unfiltered way, and in a way that doesn't have any bias that's been expressed through the reporting that usually happens.\nQ    But it’s being funded by a political organization, not the White House, is that right?\nMS. SANDERS:  Correct.\nQ    Can you explain the funding?\nQ    Who is paying for the plane tomorrow going to and from the rally?  How that's being done?\nMS. SANDERS:  Specifically on the plane I’ll have to double-check.  I know the rally itself and I guess staging and everything to do with the rally is covered by the campaign.  But I’m not sure about the plane specifically.  So I’d have to --\nQ    So just to clarify, when you say the campaign, this is the campaign for what?\nMS. SANDERS:  Well, President Trump still has a campaign in existence that can help pay for things that aren’t specific to the White House.\nQ    -- the Donald J. Trump for President, correct?\nMS. SANDERS:  Yes, that's still fully operational.\nQ    So that's a 2020 committee, not a 2016 committee?  Because that committee is now defunct.\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure if it’s officially been transferred over from a 2016 to a 2020 focus.  But we can check on that and let you know.\nQ    With increasing enforcement, that we've see in this administration, if you are not looking into having 100,000 National Guard, I’m curious if you think you have to change the immigration infrastructure at all.  Add more judges or -- you've already said you want to add more agents, but with increased enforcement, are you happy with what you have nationally and infrastructure-wise?\nMS. SANDERS:  That's probably a question that those departments -- ICE might be better able to answer whether or not they need additional support.  But right now we're just glad that they have the opportunity to actually go out and do their job, something they haven’t probably been allowed to do over the past eight years.\nQ    The President saying that he loves the DACA kids, and a couple have already been swept up in this increased enforcement, will there be anything in terms of -- besides that the President has talked about keeping DACA going or not, that's still up for debate -- will you do anything for the DACA kids who are not swept up in increased enforcement?\nMS. SANDERS:  Look, I think the President addressed that yesterday.  He wants to make sure that that's done correctly.  Obviously, there’s a compassion piece in that.  And he’s looking at those options and seeing what the best path is on that.\nQ    Sarah, just to be clear, you don't know who authored the executive order?\nMS. SANDERS:  I don't specifically know who put pen to paper, but I know that it was not Secretary Kelly and it wasn’t at his direction.\nQ    Did it happen during the transition?\nMS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware on the exact timeline of when it happened.  But what I do know is that this White House and this President is not and has had no plans in any capacity to use the National Guard to round up people.\nThanks, guys.\nEND\n3:27 P.M.

SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Happy Valentine's Day.  I can sense the love in the room.  (Laughter.)\nFirst off, last night, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control -- OFAC -- labeled the Venezuelan Vice President as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act.\nBefore I continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions, I want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questions.\nSecretary Mnuchin.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office.  Yesterday, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.  El Aissami's primary frontman, Venezuelan national Samark Lopez Bellow was also designated.\nThese designations follow a multi-year investigation into El Aissami's criminal activities.  And President Trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the Department of Treasury, the Department of State, as well as the National Security Council and many people throughout law enforcement.\nFollowing the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels, this action demonstrates the President's seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the United States.  In addition, he wants to send a clear message to the people of Venezuela that America stands with them.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to take two or three questions specifically about this.\nQ    Secretary Mnuchin, since sanctions are directly relevant, obviously, to the Treasury Department, which is an agency that you now oversee, can you talk a little bit about plans to sanction Russia and if you'll keep Obama-era sanctions against Russia?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Our current sanctions programs are in place, and I would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries.  But it's a very important program within the Treasury Department.\nQ    And for Russia specifically?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  The existing policies are in place.\nQ    Mr. Secretary, are you contemplating any additional sanctions against Iran?  And can you tell us what you think the bottom line will be at these particular sanctions you announced yesterday and are referring to today with the Venezuelan Vice President?  What's it going to mean?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Well, first, let me just comment -- again, this is as a result of a very long effort --\nQ    Did you (inaudible) the implication, by the way?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Yes, this was underway.  This was a very long effort.  But the implication is quite significant.  We expect that there will be frozen tens of millions of dollars and, again, that sanctions are a very important way of us sending a message that we will not stand for illicit activities, whether they're drug trafficking or terrorism.\nQ    On Iran, sir?\nQ    Secretary, including sanctions, what other tools are you looking at?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  I can't comment on all the tools, but, again, let me just reinforce that sanctions are a very important tool within the department and we will use them as appropriate.\nQ    What about freezing assets?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  In this case, we did freeze assets -- again, as I mentioned, tens of millions of dollars of assets.  And that will have a very big impact on this.\nSo I'll take one more question please.  Yes, in the back.\nQ    During the campaign, the President had made comments about Janet Yellen and whether -- basically inferring that she was being too political and that she should be ashamed of herself.  Do the folks at the Treasury Department and within the administration feel confident with Mrs. Yellen at the helm and to be able to set monetary policy going forward?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment.  I'm really here today, again, to talk about the Venezuelan situation.  But let me just say that there is a tradition of the Secretary of Treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve, and I look forward to that now that I'm in office doing that and spending time with her.\nThank you very much, everybody.  It's a pleasure to be here on my first day.\nMR. SPICER:  All right, let's get back to the fun.  We've been reviewing -- and I want to address the events of last night, first and foremost.  We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth.  We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where a level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\nThe President was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the Vice President and others.  He was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisors -- like China, North Korea and the Middle East -- that the President must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position.\nThe evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the President to ask for General Flynn’s resignation.  Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House Counsel of the situation, the White House Counsel briefed the President and a small group of senior advisors.  The White House Counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue.\nDuring this process it’s important to note that the President did not have his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who he trusts immensely, approved by the Senate.  When the President heard the information as presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsel’s review corroborated that.\nIt is not ordinary* [unordinary] for an incoming National Security Advisor to speak with his counterparts about the issues of concern to them.  In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his counterparts throughout the transition.  As Charles Krauthammer said last night, it is “perfectly reasonable for him to do so.”  The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynn’s relationship -- misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation.\nThat’s why the President decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it.  The irony of this entire situation is that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia.  He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia.  His Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea.  As Ambassador Haley said at the time, the “dire situation in Eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.”\nPresident Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.  At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia, unlike previous administrations, so that we can solve many problems together facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS and terrorism.\nThe President is currently evaluating a group of very strong candidates that will be considered to fill the National Security Advisor position permanently, and is confident in the ability of General Kellogg, a decorated and distinguished veteran of the United States Army, until that person is ultimately chosen.\nBefore I get into the President’s schedule for today, a quick recap of the President’s activity over the last few days, since we haven’t had the honor of spending so much time together.\nThe President has been keeping a close eye on the Oroville Dam situation in California.  We’ve worked closely with Doug LaMalfa, who represents California’s First District, where the dam is located, and other state officials to help people who have been impacted.  The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress.  Dams, bridges, roads, and all ports around the county have fallen into disrepair.  In order to prevent the next disaster, we will pursue the President’s vision for an overhaul of our nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\nWe hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue, and we’ll be working alongside with FEMA and appropriate government entities to make sure that we are doing everything we can to attend to this matter.\nThe President was honored also to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan last week from their first official meeting at the White House to their joint press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- excuse me, their joint press conference and their time together at Mar-a-Lago.  The President and the Prime Minister had a productive visit that reaffirmed their determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and economic relationship.\nAt Mar-a-Lago, the President was proud to stand behind Prime Minister Abe on Saturday to convey the United States’ unwavering support for our Japanese allies in the face of North Korea’s most recent missile launch.  On Sunday, the President met with now-Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Mr. Steve Wynn before returning to Washington.\nYesterday, the President had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, focusing on our shared commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and the problems throughout the world.  Our countries share a profound economic interest with more than $2 billion in two-way trade flowing across our border every day.\nThe President was pleased to launch the Canada-United States Council for the Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders by holding a roundtable discussion here at the White House.  Together with Prime Minister Trudeau, his daughter Ivanka, the President discussed the unique challenges that women face in the workplace with an incredible group of successful and respected female business executives from both countries.  A full list of the participants is available through the pool.\nIn addition to his in-person meetings with the prime ministers of Japan and Canada, the President also recently had phone calls with the presidents of Tunisia, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia and South Africa.  Readouts are available on all of those calls.\nFinally, following the Prime Minister's visit yesterday, the President met with Chairwoman McDaniel and Co-Chairman Paduchik of the Republican National Committee.  In the afternoon, the President participated in a pinning ceremony for Major Ricardo Turner, one of his military aides.  The aides to the President are mid-grade officers, one from of each of the services.  They provide direct support to the President in his role as Commander-in-Chief, and their primary responsibilities are to serve as an emergency action officer, aide-de-camp, and ceremonial aide.  It's a longstanding tradition that when the President's military aide is promoted to the next higher grade, the President conducts that promotion.  Major Ricardo Turner, the President's military aide, was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and the promotion was held in the Oval Office.\nThe President also spoke yesterday with Maureen Scalia on the one-year anniversary of her husband's passing.  The President and Mrs. Scalia discussed her late husband's incredible legacy, and how the President is making every effort to carry it on by nominating Judge Gorsuch, who shares the love of the Constitution, to succeed him on the bench.\nLast night, the President obviously hosted the swearing-in of Secretary Mnuchin in the Oval Office.  Secretary Mnuchin is a world-class financier whose decades of experience with financial and monetary matters make him the ideal person to spearhead the President's plan to develop a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans.  We're glad to officially have him on board.\nNow, moving on to the schedule for today -- this morning, the President and newly confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos held a parent-teacher conference meeting with parents and educators from public, private, charter, and home schools this morning.  The President opened the meeting by congratulating Secretary DeVos for her toughness and staying the course throughout her confirmation process.  He then discussed his vision for all Americans to have an opportunity to climb the ladder of success, starting with making quality education available to every child no matter their zip code.\nUnder the current system, the President believes too many of our children are trapped in failing schools, especially in the African American community.  The President told the group to begin addressing this problem, which he views as a civil rights issue.  He wants parents to be able to decide what educational options are best for their children.  The group launched into a wide-ranging discussion that included public and charter schools, home-schooling, dropout prevention, and the BASIS Schools Program, states' responsibilities, and the current state of the U.S. Department of Education.\nThe President's ultimate goal is to create safe communities, great schools, and well-paying jobs.  He believes that each of these goals is linked to the others, and the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to achieve them all.\nThe President also spoke on the phone earlier today with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, continuing the productive conversation they started during her visit earlier this year.  A readout on that call should be coming soon.  The President then had lunch with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his wife regarding combatting drug use.\nAt 2:00, the President will sign House Joint Resolution 41 in the Oval Office.  The resolution is a start of rolling back harmful Obama-era regulations, which have cost the American business consumers a staggering $890 billion, making our companies less competitive and even driving some of them out of business.  The American free enterprise system is the greatest engine for economic prosperity in the world, but for too many, to reach its maximum potential, we must remove the barriers to productivity that are holding back our great workers and businesses.\nMisguided federal regulations, such as the SEC rule addressed by HJR 41, inflict real cost on the American people and put our businesses, especially small businesses, at a significant disadvantage.  It's a priority for the Trump administration to fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances American productivity and wellbeing without imposing unnecessary costs and burdens.  Signing this joint resolution is one more step towards achieving this goal.\nLater this evening, the President will meet with Secretary Kelly and Attorney General Sessions to continue discussions on potential options for addressing the very clear national security threats we're facing in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling.\nTomorrow, the President is pleased to be welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House.  They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East.  They will consult on a range of issues -- regional issues -- including addressing the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, the crisis in Syria, and countering ISIS and other terrorist groups.\nAs the President has made clear, his administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security.  The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister.  They will hold a joint press conference tomorrow, as well, and further guidance will be coming on the time and location.\nLooking ahead to Friday, the President will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner.  This visit will give the President an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America’s number-one exporter and the millions of American workers involved in aerospace.  This trip has been months in the making, and we’re thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing plane.\nWith that, I’d be glad to take some of your questions.\nJonathan Karl.\nQ    Back in January, the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians.  Now, today, can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election?\nMR. SPICER:  My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period -- well, we were very clear that during the transition period, he did speak with the ambassador --\nQ    I’m talking about during the campaign.\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t have any -- there’s nothing that would conclude me -- that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.\nQ    And why would the President -- if he was notified 17 days ago that Flynn had misled the Vice President, other officials here, and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the Russians, why would he be kept on for almost three weeks?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, that’s not -- that assumes a lot of things that are not true.  The President was informed of this.  He asked the White House Counsel to review the situation.  The first matter was whether there was a legal issue.  We had to review whether there was a legal issue, which the White House Counsel concluded there was not, as I stated in my comments.  This was an act of trust.  Whether or not he actually misled the Vice President was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to the President asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn.  That’s it, pure and simple.  It was a matter of trust.\nWe went through a very deliberative process, a very thorough review.  The first part of it was clearly to understand the legal aspect of this, and that was simply concluded there was no legal aspect.  And then what happened is the President evaluated the trust aspect of it.\nMajor.\nQ    When the President was asked on Air Force One yesterday -- I mean, on Friday, rather, traveling down to Mar-a-Lago, about reports about conversations with the Russians about sanctions, he said, “I don’t know about it.  I’ll look into that.”  Was he being truthful?\nMR. SPICER:  What he was asked specifically is was he aware of a Washington Post story.  He hadn’t seen that at the time.  Of course, he was involved; I just said that he was aware of the situation right after the White House Counsel informed him back in January.\nQ    And his inquiry to the White House Counsel was strictly about the legalities involved, not the propriety of the conversations between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, initially, just to be --\nQ    Do you have any criticism of the merits of those conversations about sanctions before the Trump administration had been inaugurated?\nMR. SPICER:  So just to be clear, the acting Attorney General informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a “heads up” to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had sent the Vice President out in particular.  The White House Counsel informed the President immediately.  The President asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there.  That was immediately determined that there wasn’t.  That was what the President believed at the time, from what he had been told, and he was proved to be correct.\nThe issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust.  And the President concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security advisor over --\nQ    But was it proper for the incoming national security advisor, not part of an administration, to be discussing an issue as sensitive as sanctions with the Russian ambassador?\nMR. SPICER:  His job is to discuss issues with his counterparts.  I mean, Charles Krauthammer put it perfectly last night -- that’s what he’s supposed to be doing.  I mean, that’s his job.  We would constantly read out throughout the transition who he was speaking to, how he was getting ready.  The President was receiving congratulatory calls from around the world.  We would read out the world leader calls.\nThe job of the incoming NSA is to sit down with the counterparts and start that dialogue, and that’s exactly what he did.  So the question wasn’t did he do anything improper or legal, it’s a question of could he be trusted further.  And that trust, or the erosion of that trust, was, frankly, the issue.\nQ    Did the President instruct him to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador?\nMR. SPICER:  No, absolutely not.  No, no, no.  But that -- no.  And there’s no -- that’s never --\nQ    So would he have preferred he had not done that?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President had no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be doing.  He had an ability to talk about issues that were important, whether it was that or the 30 other countries that he spoke to.  That was part of his job, as has been noted by many people.  That’s what the national security advisor and, frankly, other positions do -- they begin the process of preparing their incoming job by talking to counterparts, people who have previously held the job, et cetera.  If he had not done that, there would be questions as to whether he’s properly prepared on day one.\nQ    So he (inaudible) one conversation about sanctions.\nMR. SPICER:  No, the issue isn’t whether or not -- what he discussed.  There’s been a complete legal review of that, and there’s no issue with that.  The issue is whether or not he failed to properly inform the Vice President -- or not be honest with him, or not remember it.\nBut that’s the plain and simple issue.  And when he lost trust with the President, that’s when the President asked for and received his resignation.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said that the President continued to have trust in General Flynn.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    What happened between yesterday morning and yesterday evening that led the President to lose confidence in General Flynn?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I’m not going to get into the specifics of what the President’s thinking was, but I will just say, as I noted in the opening statement, that it was an evolving and eroding process.\nAnd so at the end of the day, the President made a decision, as he does on all subjects, and asked for and received the national security advisor’s -- but he is one of those people that we’ve noted before -- when he is ready to make a decision, he makes it, whether it’s hiring somebody or asking for someone’s resignation.  Once he has determined that he’s made a decision on any subject, that’s when he informs his staff.\nSo going into the day, it was an evolving situation.  He made a determination late in the day, and he executed on it.\nYes, Alexis.\nQ    He’s an extremely loyal person, General Flynn.  Was it a difficult decision for the President to let General Flynn go?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, sure.  I mean, General Flynn is a dedicated public servant.  He’s headed the DIA, he has been an outstanding member of the Army, both as an officer and then as a flag officer.  He’s served this country admirably.  And I think the President appreciated his service to his nation, his commitment to his campaign, and his service to this country so far.\nBut at some point, the decision came down on whether or not that that trust had eroded.  The important matters, as I mentioned, that are before the President when he’s dealing with issues of world matters, of all of the issues -- friends and allies, foes, hot spots -- he needs to rely on a national security advisor to give him sage advice.  And I think at a certain point, that guidance, that trust, eroded.  And the President, as he does on all matters, ultimately decides that when he's ready to make a decision, he executes.\nAlexis.\nQ    Sean, two questions.  Does the President believe that anything that he discussed with General Flynn during the transition might have been construed by the General as a request or an encouragement to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador?  That's question number one.\nMR. SPICER:  So -- oh, we're going to pause.  So, on the first, again, as I made clear, there's nothing that the General did that was a violation of any sort.  He was well within his duties to discuss issues of common concern between the two countries.  I will say it again:  What this came down to is a matter of trust.  The President was glad that he was out there conducting his job, preparing for his job, going back and forth with his counterparts throughout the world, much as the President had done with all of these world leaders calling the President, congratulating him, looking to set up calls for him once he was inaugurated.\nSimilarly, General Flynn was beginning that process with his counterparts throughout the world.  That was never of a concern to the President, from day one that he was briefed from the White House Counsel.  The issue, plain and simple, came down to a matter of trust.  And once that occurred, it was over.\nQ    On question number one, just to clarify, the President does not believe that any discussion that might have taken place -- and we know from intel, it did, on sanctions -- creates a problem for the President in any way -- that that is not a problem, that General Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russians?\nMR. SPICER:  No, there is -- I can't say it clearly enough.  There was nothing in what General Flynn did, in terms of conducting himself, that was an issue.  What it came down to, plain and simple, was him misleading the Vice President and others, and not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that.  That's it.\nQ    Question number two.  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle would like to investigate or probe or ask more questions about this.  Does the President hope to cooperate with those investigations?  Would he instruct members of his staff who worked for him here and in the administration to cooperate with those investigations?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, we're going to comply with the law.  I think the President feels very confident the review that was conducted by White House Counsel was very thorough and concluded very conclusively, as he had first come to -- instinctively come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong.  So people are free to do what they wish, but I think that they will find exactly what the President first believed and what the White House Counsel concluded.  And, frankly, I believe a couple publications even reported that there was no investigation for a reason -- because there was not an issue of law, it was an issue of trust.\nGeorge.\nQ    When do you expect to have a replacement in place?  And secondly, on another topic, there was a report yesterday that one of your colleagues said the White House is keeping dossiers on reporters.  Can you say if that's true or not?\nMR. SPICER:  That is absolutely not true.  There are no dossiers being kept.  It's just a binder that I put right here, that's about it.  That was a joke.  Hold on one second.  And then, I'm sorry, George, the first part?\nQ    Timetable on a replacement.\nMR. SPICER:  Just like the way he handled this situation, the President will meet with individuals, and when he's ready to make a decision and he feels as though the person is qualified and can properly advise him on the issue, he'll make that decision.  But that, as all decisions, rests with him.\nI'm just going to go to my first Skype seat.  John Huck of WKVVU out of Las Vegas.\nJohn.\nQ    Thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity to join you today.  As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession -- more so than perhaps any other city in the country.  As the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you make to Nevadans that those actions won't lead banks and investments banks to re-engage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks out?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, John.  I think one of the things -- if you look at the intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we didn't have institutions that were too big to fail.  And frankly, it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail.  Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do.  And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41 that the President is signing today, this is another example of the President taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are, frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation's banks and businesses than helping them.\nI think the President is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually intended to do.  But right now, we actually, through Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off.  We've created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authority.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ    Let me go back to what you said at the beginning.  You said the White House Counsel's Office reviewed this and determined that there was nothing illegal.  What evidence did they look at in making this determination?  And secondly, Democrats up on the Hill say that they want an investigation of this.  They're looking into what did the President know and when did he know it.  So can you tell us what evidence you looked at the White House Counsel's Office, and what did the President know about all of this and when was he aware of it?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, as I mentioned, the first day that the Department of Justice made White House Counsel available -- or sought to notify White House Counsel was January 26th.  The President was immediately informed of the situation.  As I said, based on the information that was provided at the time, the view was that this was not a violation.  He was proved instinctively correct.  And White House Counsel at that time undertook an extensive review both of materials and questioning --\nQ    Did they --\nMR. SPICER:  I'm not going to get into the specifics.  What I will tell you is, on multiple occasions they had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of General Flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided to them, or materials that were provided to them to review.  I'm not going to get into the details of that, but I will just say that there was an exhaustive review.\nAnd again, the thing that's important to note is the Vice President and myself -- in fact, I think the first time I brought this issue up was January 13 -- the Department of Justice didn’t notify the White House or the White House Counsel at that time in the transition phase until 13 days later.\nSo I think it's important to understand something very, very important:  This idea of why did it take so long -- I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this.  They were aware of this.  We were making statements based on what General Flynn was telling us, starting on January 13th.  The Vice President went out on the 15th, right?  They didn’t notify the White House Counsel's Office until January 26th.  At that time, there was an immediate -- the President was immediately informed of that and then asked the White House Counsel to conduct a very, very thorough review.  The first part of that review was focused on whether or not there was any legal issue -- that's it.  Once that became the issue, then there was a -- it shifted into phase two, which is whether or not there was trust still maintained.  Then that became a separate set of issues that were --\nQ   I understand.  I'm speaking to the actual evidence, that the FBI has transcripts of these intercepts, which I assume were done by the NSA via a FISA Court order.  Was there any communication between the White House Counsel's Office and the FBI?  Did those transcripts ever enter --\nMR. SPICER:  I will say that obviously -- there was obviously communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel's Office.  I'm not going to get into the specific nature of that.  I think it would be inappropriate because of the nature of the information that was being discussed.\nYes.\nQ    Why not dismiss the General on January 27th?  Why, if the question was of trust, and immediately you have on the 15th, he's on \"Face the Nation\" saying that -- the Vice President on \"Face the Nation\" saying that this is what General Flynn told me, and then January 26th you hear the opposite -- why not immediately act?  Why wait another two and a half weeks?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t understand how that's a due process.  Because what the -- the Attorney General didn’t come -- the Acting Attorney General -- come in and say that there was an issue.  She said, we wanted to give you a head's up that there may be information, okay?  She could not confirm there was an investigation.  And so it would be unbelievably short-sighted and wrong to go in and dismiss someone immediately.  In fact, what the President did was take decisive action to make sure that the White House Counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted the situation.  He took immediate, decisive action.  And if you look at the timeline in terms of what he did and how that expanded, the White House Counsel's first and foremost goal was to make sure that there was not a legal issue at hand.  Once that was concluded, then it became a phase of determining whether or not the General's action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined his trust in the President.  But the President, from day one, from minute one, was unbelievably decisive in asking for and demanding that his White House Counsel and their team review the situation, first and foremost, to question whether it's a legal issue.  And what they immediately determined -- not immediately, but within several days, was that, after review, that there was not a legal issue, and then it moved into a second phase.\nMara.\nQ    So wait -- because the President tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks -- illegal leaks.\nMR. SPICER:  It is leaks.  But if you think about this -- understand that all of this information was leaked.  I mean, I got to -- and again, I know we've got me lecturing you about what the story should be, but I think that there's a real story here.  The idea that not just in this administration, but the Obama administration going back to the Bush administration and back, that we have an issue where classified information, of which this would be, is handled in such a way that it is being given out.\nAnd I know in some cases it's a good story, and I understand that, and that's to some degree your responsibility to write that.  But I think there's also a story here, with the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out.  That's a real concern for this President; that when he's talking on the phone with a world leader, that when he's making key decisions that are in the interest of protecting this country, that we have to wonder whether or not people who work for our government, who are entrusted with classified information and decision-based materials are leaking that information out.  That, I do believe, is a big story that should be reported.  I also believe that the President is, rightly so, very, very concerned about this, because it's not just something that is plaguing the current situation, but it goes back through the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration.  When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security, frankly.\nTrey.\nQ    Hold on --\nMR. SPICER:  Sorry, I apologize, Mara.\nQ    I know you just forgot.  I have a question, but I want you to clarify something you just said to John.  Are you saying that no one has read the transcripts of the calls, or you just don’t want to tell us whether they --\nMR. SPICER:  I said that I'm not going to comment on it.\nQ    Okay.  So my question is about sanctions.  You were very specific in talking about the sanctions against Crimea and that he doesn’t want to lift them until Crimea is returned.  But the sanctions that Flynn was discussing were the sanctions for the election hacking.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    That's something the President could remove on his own if he wanted to.  Is he committed to keeping those?\nMR. SPICER:  I think Secretary Mnuchin commented on that.  There's no change in our current sanctions strategy with Russia, and I've got nothing for you on that.\nTrey.\nQ    Given that the current story is leaks, what is the President willing to do to investigate further to determine where these leaks are coming from?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, again, I think this goes back to the same way he negotiates.  Telling people what we’re going to do to cover up additional leaks wouldn’t be a very sound strategy when it comes to making sure that that doesn’t happen again.  The President has been very clear, whether he’s negotiating or dealing with an issue like this, you don’t telegraph to people how you’re going to handle it.\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, Trey gets a follow-up.  Everyone else got one.\nQ    So he is going to take some sort of steps to investigate these leaks that the administration --\nMR. SPICER:  I would just say that the President, as I said, is clearly upset about this.  He understands the threat that they pose to our national security, and he’s going to make sure that he continues to take action to make sure that that stops.\nYes.\nQ    Thank you.  So you’ve mentioned time and time again that this is an issue of trust.  You also said that it was an evolving issue, and that the issue of the trust that the President had for Flynn came down to this deception that happened with the Vice President but also a host of whole other -- of other issues.  What were the other issues?  And was the Vice President the only person that was misled by Flynn?  Were other people misled?\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, I think I've stood before you before and explained what General Flynn had conveyed to me.  I think there were some others that he had similarly expressed that to, as well.  So that’s why it’s others, because it wasn’t just people who went out and made public pronouncements and a series of questioning that was rather exhaustive over a long period of time.  He continued to maintain that that had not occurred, and I think that’s where the President continued to -- and that’s why the President was very clear that it was an eroding issue.  Because it was after a series of issues and a series of statements and pronouncements that the President came to that conclusion.\nQ    Were there other issues outside of this call and the deception over that that led to the mistrust with Flynn?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the statement is very clear that it was this and a series of issues.\nWith that, let me go to Jason Stevens of the Federalist Paper in Ashland, Ohio.\nQ    Thank you.  What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the American Founders.  One of those principles, in the Declaration of Independence, is the consent of the governed.  So my question is this:  What are the President’s future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state, most of which are the product of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything, let alone make law?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jason.  I think, as I mentioned today, the President, in just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR 41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect to the SEC in particular.\nHe is going to continue -- last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation, two must be gotten rid of.  The President’s commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government, I think, is unwavering and unquestionable.  So you’re going to continue to see this President undo a lot of that government overreach.\nJim.\nQ    Yeah, just a quick question.  You said earlier in your comments that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia.  How is that possible?  He has made comment after comment over the course of the campaign, the transition, where he defended Vladimir Putin.  He had an interview with Bill O’Reilly where he, when he was asked if Vladimir Putin is a killer, he said, well, America hasn’t been that much better in this regard also.\nTo me it seems, and I think to a lot of Americans it seems that this President has not been tough on Russia.  How can you say that?\nMR. SPICER:  Because I just walked through it.  I think there’s a difference between the President wanting to have an understanding of how a good relationship with Russia can help us defeat ISIS and terrorism throughout the world.\nLook, the Obama administration tried to have a reset with Russia.  They failed.  They tried to tell Russia not to invade Crimea.  They failed.  This President understands that it’s in America’s national and economic interests to have a healthy relationship.  If he has a great relationship with Putin in Russia, great.  If he doesn’t, then he’ll continue on.  But he’s not going to just assume that because it wasn’t able to happen in the past -- I think you’ve seen, with Prime Minister Abe in particular and others, that the reset that Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about tomorrow -- so many of these countries from around the globe are looking forward to resetting the relationships that this country has with them; that they feel as though they were abandoned over the last eight years, and that they are excited about the prospect of a new U.S. relationship under a Trump administration.\nBut with respect to Russia, I think the comments that Ambassador Haley made at the U.N. were extremely forceful and very clear that until --\nQ    That was an announcement from Haley, not the President.\nMR. SPICER:  She speaks for the President.  I speak for the President.  All of us in this administration.  And so all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this President.  So I don’t think we could be any clearer on the President’s commitment.\nKatie Pavlich.\nQ    Quick little follow-up, because I haven’t had any follow-ups or questions in a while.  But anyway --\nMR. SPICER:  Really?\nQ    No -- the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled.  Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation?\nMR. SPICER:  No, look, the trust is given by the President.  It’s a relationship between he and any individual.  And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because -- I don't know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isn’t just --\nQ    Isn't that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about --\nMR. SPICER:  But that’s the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation.\nKatie Pavlich.\nQ    Sean, on the trust issue and the eroding of trust, last night, in General Flynn’s resignation letter, he said he inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    Considering his role in advising the President on national security matters, is the White House concerned that he maybe briefed the President-elect, Vice President-elect with incomplete information on other matters of national security in addition to his phone calls with the Russian ambassador?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, when you look at the team, it’s not one person in isolation, Katie.  It’s several.  You’ve got General Kelly on the homeland security front, General Mattis on the DOD front -- he’s got an entire national security staff and apparatus that briefs him -- you know, Director Pompeo at the CIA, and others from the DNI’s office that come in and brief him on a whole host of issues.  So it’s not a single position.\nQ    So was his situation an isolated incident of giving incomplete --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, yeah.  Regardless of whether it’s a single situation, it’s not as though there’s one person briefing him.  And the President synthesizes a lot of information, both written and stuff that is briefed to him, and ultimately it is he who makes that decision based a lot on what he already knows, what he is presented with.  So the President gets information from a lot of people -- generals, admirals, people in the military community, ambassadors, people in the State Department, an exhaustive team at the National Security Council, and then makes an ultimate decision based on that and what he already knows to be the case.\nQ    Sean, you’ve been asked a couple times about these transcripts of calls.  Will the White House declassify those and release them?\nMR. SPICER:  Looks, it is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time.  Right now, the focus is on some of the evolving issues that were going around the globe, as you know.\nQ    Will you be open to it?\nMR. SPICER:  Let me answer the question.  It is not an issue that has come up.  I think the President right now is focused on replacing his national security advisor, making sure that he’s presented with the best possible information to make these key decisions.\nBut at this time, we also have got to be careful that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of national security.  And the review, as I mentioned, was done and then immediately last night when the President felt as though it was time for a decision, made it.  That’s where we are in this iteration of the process.  If we have anything further for you, we will update you.\nI want to go to Joyce Kaufman of WFTL Talk News in Palm Beach, Florida.\nQ    Thank you so much for this opportunity.  I’m approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago right now, and the President met with Prime Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.  And besides giving us traffic and security nightmares, there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the Prime Minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area.  There is already video of this surfacing.  Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining areas, these public places?  And one last question.  When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the embassy, and settlements?\nMR. SPICER:  On the second one, I’m not going to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s discussion with the President.  We’ll have a readout.  After that, there will be a press conference.\nWith respect to the first, there is a SCIF at Mar-a-Lago.  And just to be clear, the briefing -- the President was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner.  He went with his national security team.  They briefed him on the situation in North Korea.  Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members.  At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed.  There was simply a discussion about press logistics, where to host the event.  And then after the dinner, the President went back into the SCIF to get a further update from his team.\nSo I’m not really sure where people jumped to conclusions.  There is a SCIF there.  It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President by his national security team the situation in North Korea.  And then the President subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware.\nMargaret.\nQ    Sean, can you just clarify, because I got a little turned around -- did President Trump, or President-elect Trump at the time, know of General Flynn’s discussion of the sanctions while he was NSC-designate?  And if not, when did he finally learn about them?  And if so, why was he okay with that?\nMR. SPICER:  So, no, he was not aware, as he’s not back-briefed on every conversation that his national security team has or other staffers.  They were performing their duties, as other people were in terms of getting up to speed, conveying with counterparts and previous members of their team.\nThat being said, when he was made aware of it, once the White House Counsel briefed him on concerns the Department of Justice had -- and at that point, as I mentioned, what he asked and what he believed at the time and was confirmed by White House Counsel was that there was no legal issue here.  Discussing the issue didn’t violate anything; it was appropriate in the normal course of action to discuss that.  And he immediately asked the White House Counsel to further confirm what his instincts were at the time.\nThank you, guys.  Have a great one.  We’ve got everybody for a bill signing.  We’ve got a bill signing.\nQ    I didn’t get my --\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, he’s got -- Margaret gets a follow-up, but he’s got --\nQ    Are you -- is the administration undertaking any sort of effort, either Cabinet-wide or, like, inside the shop to make sure that everyone comes forward who had any communications with the Russians about sanctions or otherwise?\nMR. SPICER:  There’s no other information.  I mean, as far as we are aware, that is an isolated incident that occurred.  And again, the key point in this isn’t that there were discussions.  There was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions.  It purely came down to a matter of trust.  That’s it.\nThank you, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Happy Valentine’s Day.\nEND\n2:00 P.M.

{"source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-292017-11", "text": "The White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\nFor Immediate Release\nFebruary 09, 2017\nJames S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:53 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Here we go.  Good afternoon, everyone.  As you just saw, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of Attorney General Sessions in the Oval Office just a short time ago.\nUnder Attorney General Sessions, the Justice Department will return to its original, core mission:  to uphold the rule of law to ensure that justice is administered and enforced fairly and impartially for all Americans.  Attorney General Sessions is a world-class legal mind and experienced prosecutor, and the President is pleased to have him finally in place as our nation’s top law enforcement officer.\nAfter the Attorney General’s swearing-in, the President signed three executive orders dedicated to standing behind the police officers who risk their lives every day to protect us and our communities, reducing crime, and stopping cartel violence.\nThe first executive order directs the newly installed Attorney General to develop a strategy for more effectively prosecuting people who commit violence against members of law enforcement.  We must better protect those who protect us.  Our men and women in blue need to know that we're with them 100 percent as they patrol our streets.\nUnfortunately, this has not always been the case.  Law enforcement officials have been vocal about the lack of support they received under the past administration.  This lack of support demoralized many officers and, in some cases, led to their discouraging their engagement with local communities, only causing further harm and deterioration.\nIt's imperative that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies better coordinate and share information across jurisdictions to better serve and protect our communities.  This order will start the important work of doing just that, instituting a holistic approach that involves the whole of government.  It also directs the Department of Justice to work with other federal agencies to come up with ways to further reduce violence against law enforcement, and orders a hard look at how the Department of Justice and other agencies use their law enforcement grants.\nThe second order establishes a task force, led by the new Attorney General, to reduce crime and restore public safety in communities across America.  Together, the members of this task force are going to come up with specific recommendations -- how we can change existing federal law to better prevent crime and improve public safety, and develop stronger working relationships with our state and local partners.  The President is confident that this task force will develop a systematic strategy to help further protect the American people.\nCommunities across our nation have been devastated by a surge in violent-crime rates, particularly in our major cities.  Over the last eight years, we've experienced declining focus on law and order.  Crime reduction will clearly be a priority for this White House.\nThe last executive order re-focuses the energy and resources of the federal government to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, such as drug cartels.  It's important to emphasize that we cannot reduce crime in the United States without additionally addressing illegal immigration and illegal drugs.  Through this executive order, the President instructs the Attorney General to form a comprehensive and decisive approach to destroying transnational crime organizations and drug cartels.\nThese cartels represent a clear and present danger to our nation.  They bring dangerous criminals, drugs, and violence to once-peaceful neighborhoods both here at home and in other parts of the world.  They have fueled addiction and overdose deaths, and they can no longer be allowed to operate with impunity in our country or our hemisphere.\nThis order pulls together the experience and resources of federal agencies to work towards emphasizing specific goals in this regard.  Number one, to upgrade our information-gathering about these transnational organizations and cartels.  Without accurate information about these threats, and the ability and willingness to share this information, we're not going to be able to tackle this problem.\nIt's important to note that, prior to this administration, if you had called the Department of Justice to ask for these statistics, they never kept them.  So knowing what we're facing is a big part of addressing the problem.\nNumber two, improving the speed and efficiency of removing criminal aliens, cartel members, and people who help cartels from our nation.  Unlike during the last eight years, these criminals are finally going to go home.\nThree, shift whatever resources we can to tackling these organizations and prevent them from disrupting our society any further.\nNow, on to the President’s schedule.  This morning, the President held a breakfast and listening session with key stakeholders in the airline industry.  We've got a participant list if you're interested.  The President thanked the attendees for the 10 million jobs and $1 trillion in annual economic activity they contribute to our economy, and praised them for moving approximately 2 million passengers per day in spite of the outdated infrastructure and equipment that they have in terms of air traffic control and other infrastructure measures.\nThe President asked the aviation leaders what the government can do to help their industry grow and create more well-paying jobs for Americans.  The leaders commented that they had never been given the opportunity to truly work alongside the President in such an open and constructive way.  And they were unanimous in asking for the President to offer relief from the duplicative and burdensome regulations that are stifling job creation, which he assured them he'd do.\nThe President also reaffirmed his commitment to foregoing -- to forging, rather, public-private partnerships that will rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure.  He pledged to work closely with the airline industry to modernize the technology systems that keep our nation’s airports running, and to expedite the approval process for future airline infrastructure projects.  It's the President’s goal to make sure the United States has the most advanced airline system in the world, and this meeting was an important first step in achieving that.\nAfter the executive order signing, the President spoke with the President of Afghanistan and the Emir of Qatar.  My understanding is that we should have readouts shortly on both of those calls.\nJust concluding, a few moments ago the President held a Supreme Court and legislative listening session and lunch with Democratic and Republican senators.  In attendance were Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota; Senator Tester of Montana; Senator Donnelly of Indiana; Senator Manchin of West Virginia; Senator Moore Capito, also of West Virginia; Senator Cornyn of Texas; Senator Alexander Of Tennessee; Senator Coons of Delaware, and Senator Bennet of Colorado.\nThe President expressed his hope that these senators and their colleagues will give Judge Gorsuch a fair consideration and vote based on his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court.  With over 100 federal judicial nominations potentially happening during this administration, it's critical for us to have open dialogue and work towards bipartisan agreement so that our justice system returns to its important work on behalf of the American people.\nLater today, the President will speak with the Emir of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq.  He will provide readouts -- or we will provide readouts of those calls moving towards the conclusion of them.\nWe also anticipate that the Senate will hold a vote to confirm Secretary-designate Price this evening or into the early hours of Friday to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services.\nThe President was glad to see that the Army Corps of Engineers announced last night the final easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline.  With this final federal authorization completed, and the President working to reduce further unnecessary delays, this infrastructure project can finally continue to move forward.  The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline was one of the President’s campaign promises and the subject of one of his first executive orders.  The administration is pleased that Americans will be going to work building this pipeline, and building it with American steel whenever possible.\nNow, looking to the upcoming schedule.  Tomorrow, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abe of Japan.  The President and the Prime Minister will hold a press conference at 1:00 p.m. in the East Room.  They will depart Washington around 3:00 tomorrow afternoon for Mar-A-Lago, where the President is honored to host the Prime Minister at the Winter White House.\nAs we recently announced just earlier today, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada will visit the White House on Monday.  The President looks forward to a constructive conversation and strengthening the deep relationship that exists between the United States and Canada.  The President will also host Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel next Wednesday.  We’ll have further guidance on the press availability potentials for either one of those.\nOne last thing before I take your questions, amid surging levels of CEO confidence and in the wake of the incredible jobs announcement made at the White House yesterday by Intel, there's also new numbers released today by the Department of Labor showing that unemployment claims are at near historic lows.\nThe President knows better than anyone what businesses need to create jobs, and the market is responding to his policy improvements.  This administration will continue to roll back burdensome regulations and lower the overall tax burden on Americans so they can hire even more people and create even more innovative projects.\nWith that, I’ll take your questions.  Kaitlan Collins.\nQ    Thank you.  Hundreds of bureaucrats at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make more than members of Congress.  Forty of them make more than Vice President Mike Pence.  Does the President have plans to revamp this agency?  And if so, does he feel that he should be able to fire the head of the agency at his will?\nMR. SPICER:  I think I've addressed this before, but we have no updates right now on the head of CFPB.  If we do, I’ll let you know.\nWith respect to the first part of that question, I think one of the things that you’re going to continue to see from this President is a respects for taxpayers’ dollars, the money they spend, and how they’re spent.  We are going to continue to review all aspects of government.  I think you’ll see further announcements as far as how he’s going to look at -- how he’s going to approach and innovate and update government.\nThe bottom line is that we should be paying people a fair wage for their service to this country, but that we should doing it in the most effective and efficient manner.  And I think that’s what the President has already shown towards his commitment towards helping reduce the cost of several programs through the government and bringing back jobs.  But there’s going to be a respect for taxpayers in this administration, so that whether it's salaries or actual positions or programs, he’s going to have a very, very tough look at how we’re operating government, how many positions they're in, what people are getting paid.\nBut the President understands that most Americans are out there working night and day trying to get by, and that Washington truly needs to respect the money that they spend, and that we should be doing it in a way that shows that -- with a level of respect in terms of how many people are hiring, what they’re paid, what programs we’re looking at, whether or not that program is duplicative.  But it’s not just about one department or one agency.  It’s really about looking at how government as a whole operates.\nJohn.\nQ    Sean, questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady Briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump.  Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line?\nMR. SPICER:  Kellyanne has been counseled and that’s all we’re going to go with.  She’s been counseled on that subject, and that’s it.\nQ    And could I ask a question.  Reuters has a story out that includes a partial transcript of the President’s call with Vladimir Putin, in which he appears to express doubts about the New START Treaty.  Does he indeed have doubts about the New START Treaty?  Would he like to see that renegotiated?\nMR. SPICER:  The President’s conversation with President Putin is a private call between the two of them, and I’m going to leave it at that.  We put a readout on the call, and we have nothing further beyond that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  One question today.\nMR. SPICER:  Wow.\nQ    (Laughter.)  On February 2nd, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a well-known filmmaker in Russia and was a close associate of the late Boris Nemtsov, the dissident, found himself in critical condition.  His wife has since said she believes this is poisoning, very much like the conditions that almost took his life two years ago.  And does the administration have any comment about that, or the frustration of Mr. Navalny, the opponent of President Putin to get on the ballot as a candidate?\nMR. SPICER:  I think our State Department is aware of the situation, we’re monitoring it, and I’ll leave it at that.\nBlake.\nQ    Sean, the President said today in the airlines representative meeting that he hopes to have an announcement within the next two to three weeks about lowering the burden of taxes for businesses.  At the Super Bowl interview, he was asked, can Americans expect a tax break in 2017, and he said, \"I think so, yes.  I would like to say yes.\"  It sounds like he’s a little bit more confident for the businesses than individual tax breaks for Americans.  Is the business component at this point ahead of the individual component?\nMR. SPICER:  No, it’s a comprehensive -- yeah -- thanks for asking.  I think we’re looking at, in the next few weeks, rolling out the outline of a comprehensive tax plan that we’ll be working with Congress on that will address both the business side of the tax ledger as well as the individual rates.  But it’s going to be a comprehensive plan, something that we haven’t seen since 1986.\nBut I think when you look at the segueing of that, we’ve got two opportunities for reconciliation this year.  One is using the FY17 budget, which you can easily get Obamacare repeal and replace done, and then you can use the FY18 budget to utilize the second opportunity at reconciliation to do comprehensive reform.  But we recognize the need.  I mean, it’s been since 1986 that something like this, of this scale and magnitude, had happened.\nThe President recognizes that middle-class Americans need tax relief, and that’s going to be part of that.  But we also recognize -- and you saw that in all of these businesses meetings, whether it’s inversions or other means in which people are shipping jobs overseas or reestablishing themselves or the profits that are kept over there -- we need fundamental, comprehensive tax reform that addresses both sides of that income stream.\nQ    Can you say if this is going to be a mix between what he had put out there on the campaign and what House Republicans had put out there before?  Because there’s some similarities but clearly some differences as well.\nMR. SPICER:  I’m just going to say that you're going to have to wait a couple weeks before we put out that outline.  But I can tell you that it’s something that is going to spur economic growth.  It’s going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need.\nBut more importantly, I think part of the issue that we continue to see over and over again with businesses is that we're facing competition from abroad because of our tax code.  It favors companies from not wanting to stay, and the President recognizes that.  And what he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but makes it -- incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here.\nSo I think -- I don't want to get any further ahead of it, but I will tell you that it is going to be the first time that this nation has seen a full comprehensive tax reform in a long, long time.\nYes.\nQ    Yes, the President this morning tweeted that our country is “bogged down in conflict all over the place.”  Where are we bogged down?\nMR. SPICER:  I think there are several places that we've been --\nQ    What does he mean by that?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that if you look at ISIS in particular and the hotspots around the country, the places that we have to monitor, there's a lot of countries through the Middle East in particular -- Northern Africa -- that we are having to address and deal with and monitor because of the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.\nThere's no question that the spread of it has gone -- in the last eight years has proliferated.  And I think that the resources that we have to spend -- this isn’t a traditional war where you're just looking at the other enemy with a uniform and saying, here’s the country we're fighting.  The proliferation of ISIS throughout this country has made it so that we have to focus a lot more in a lot more places and expend a lot more resources because it’s more of a disparate approach that we have to employ, as opposed to having one country that you're facing at one time.\nQ    But “bogged down” suggests it’s something we can't get out of?\nMR. SPICER:  I just answered the question.  I understand.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  And happy Lantern Festival to you.\nMR. SPICER:  Happy Lantern Festival to you.\nQ    Thank you.  Regarding the very nice letter that President Trump sent to President Xi Jinping last night, I’m curious about the timing.  And also in the letter, President Trump said he’s looking forward to the event of constructive relationship with China.  So could you elaborate the importance of this bilateral relationship to the U.S.?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think it’s obviously important to us.  And the President understands that.  I think he’s spoken fairly often about China, and he understands both the national and economic interests that we have, the desire for our companies to access the Chinese market, but also the national security interests that we have.  And so he obviously wants to do what he can to have a fruitful and constructive relationship with China, and he looks forward to developing that as we go forward.\nSarah.\nQ    Sean, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said today that they could use a few thousand more troops in Afghanistan to help the coalition efforts there.  Going off Mike’s question, if we're trying to get out of conflicts like that, does the administration plan to send those additional forces to Afghanistan?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President will heed the advice of the generals and Secretary Mattis.  That conversation has yet to happen -- and if we have any further announcements.  But I think that's right now a Department of Defense issue that you should raise with.\nHallie.\nQ    Sean, two questions for you.  I want to get to one on immigration.  But first on the comments from Judge Gorsuch that have been reported out, I just have a two-parter.  But does the President still stand by his nomination?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.\nQ    Given where Gorsuch stands --\nMR. SPICER:  That's number one?\nQ    No, the second part of a two-part.\nMR. SPICER:  Oh.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Given where --\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not calling on you anymore.\nQ    Given Judge Gorsuch’s position on the President’s attitude toward the judiciary, and given that the President has praised Neil Gorsuch for his intellect and for his integrity, does the President have any regrets about the comments that he’s made about federal judges?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President’s comments speak for -- no, he has no regrets.  But he’s very proud of the selection that he’s made, and he’s going to make a great associate justice to the Supreme Court.\nQ    Now about the selection, but about the comments that he said, for example, about Judge --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that, I just -- he has no regrets.  Thank you.\nQ    On immigration, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos --\nMR. SPICER:  Look what you started, April Ryan.\nQ    Why are you calling me out?  I didn’t do anything.  (Laughter.)\nQ    I know the White House, I'm sure, has been following the situation of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos.  And so I want to know, does the President believe she should have been deported?  And what message does he have to others in her position?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I’m going to refer you back to ICE on that.  That’s an ICE matter.\nQ    The President has no comment?\nMR. SPICER:  The issue is developing in Arizona right now, and I would refer you back to ICE.\nMargaret.\nQ    She’s in Mexico right now, though.\nMR. SPICER:  I’d refer you back to ICE.\nQ    Sean, in that lunch meeting, the President said that -- he basically said Senator Blumenthal’s comments were taken out of context, and that --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, no, Judge Gorsuch’s comments were -- yeah.\nQ    Judge Gorsuch, right.  And that his relaying of Judge Gorsuch’s comments were taken out of context.  However, Senator Ayotte, who is working with the White House to help shepherd Judge Gorsuch through the Hill, released a statement confirming those same remarks, “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”\nMR. SPICER:  Right, so here’s what --\nQ    Is the President aware of that?  Because she was in that meeting.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, of course he’s aware.  This is what Senator Ayotte said:  \"Judge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on [any] specific cases, and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.  He has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referencing* [referring to] any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.”\nSo there is a big difference between commenting on the specific comments that had been made in the tweet and his general philosophy about the judiciary and his respect for his fellow judges.  And I think the senator’s comments were very clear about how those are two distinct issues.\nQ    Right.  And the judge’s comments as relayed through others were also in that context of the President’s attacks on the judiciary, which is what the senator you just read out was also talking about there.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    Was the President aware of that?  Because Senator Ayotte was sitting right across from him when he said that those comments were inaccurately reported or conveyed.\nMR. SPICER:  No, the way that Senator Blumenthal characterized them, he was talking about the tweets and saying that he was disheartened.  That’s not what the judge said.  He was making two very complete, distinct arguments about how he views the comments that he should not be commenting on a political matter or on specific things.\nBut as a whole, he doesn’t like attacks in general on the judiciary.  It was a very distinct argument that he was making.  And I think that that’s where I think we’ve got to be clear, and that’s what Senator Ayotte was saying this morning.  Very, very different.\nCecilia.\nQ    Is he to take that on board?  I mean --\nMR. SPICER:  Is he what?\nQ    Is he taking that on board?  I mean, you just said he doesn’t regret his past attacks on the judiciary.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    But now you have these confirmed remarks, which you were saying were exactly what the judge was talking about.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no --\nQ    And that’s not changing the President’s own --\nMR. SPICER:  But hold on -- but, again, I think it’s important to understand that the judge was very clear that he was not commenting on any specific matter, right?  And then the he was asked about his general philosophy.  So you can’t then take that -- equate it back to the specific.  He literally went out of his way to say, I’m not commenting on a specific instance.  So to take what he said about a generalization and apply it to a specific is exactly what he was intending not to do.\nQ    In other words, the President will continue to speak like this.\nMR. SPICER:  Of course he will.  The President is going to speak his mind.  It goes back to Thomas Jefferson, that Presidents have commented on judicial nominees.  I mean, the idea of one branch talking about or commenting on another branch is as old as our republic.\nSo I don’t know why -- and I find it interesting when President Obama criticized the Supreme Court for its Citizens United comments in the State of the Union, there wasn’t a similar concern about that.  The idea that this is --\nQ    Well, I guess the \"so-called judge\" portion of it, the personal attack.\nMR. SPICER:  But at some point it seems like there is clearly a double standard when it’s -- how this is applied.  When President Obama did it, there was no concern from this briefing room.  When he does it, it’s a ton of outrage.\nSo I just -- with all due respect, I think the President has made very clear that he was concerned about how that executive order in particular, which is what we’re talking about, was applied.  And I think we’ve addressed it from this briefing room over and over and over again that the U.S. code gives the President very clear authority to make this happen.\nCecilia.\nQ    I want to make sure I understand what you’re saying.  Are you saying that “demoralizing” and “disheartening” was not specifically about the President’s comments and what he said?  And if so, how does the President know that?  Has he spoken to the Judge?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think the Judge literally made it very clear in his comments.\nQ    But three senators have come out and said that they corroborate that statement, and said that --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  Senator Ayotte, who was there, made it very clear that he was commenting in general about attacks on the judiciary.  That was it.  Plain and simple.\nQ    But three other senators have said, and the spokesman and for the Judge, on the record.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that, Cecilia.  I can tell you that Senator Ayotte, who has been with him on every single thing, was very clear about that.  There’s no -- so I understand that.  And that is -- she has made it very clear over and over again.\nYes.\nQ    Sean, your answer about the context doesn't make sense when you think about what Senator Ben Sasse said today and this morning on TV.  He said that he asked Judge Gorsuch specifically about the President’s “so-called judge” tweet.  And in response --\nMR. SPICER:  Phil, this is like the fourth time I’ve asked and answered.\nQ    No, but this is a different context, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  Phil, I have asked --\nQ    This is directly about the President's tweet.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I’ve said exactly what Senator Ayotte said about it.  I don't know how many times you guys --\nQ    But her comment was only about Blumenthal.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand, thank you.\nQ    Sean, I'm going to continue on this line, despite what was just happening there.  Why isn’t the White House, why isn’t the President concerned about the influence or the appearance of the influence on the independent judiciary?\nMR. SPICER:  Why isn’t he -- I mean, he is free to speak his mind.  Where has this outrage been for the last hundred years?  There has been --\nQ    I'm not asking about the Obama administration or any previous administration, I’m talking about this President and this White House.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And the President has -- part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind.  He doesn't hold it back.  He’s authentic.  And he’s not going to sit back, I think, when he feels very passionately about something as much as the executive order.\nHe was doing it to make sure Americans were safe.  The order -- the U.S. code is crystal-clear on this.  I think I’ve read it for like three days in a row.  And it can't be any clearer how much authority it gives the President to do what he can to keep us safe.  He’s concerned that he’s doing what he can to keep this country safe, and there has been a lot of activity to stand in the way.\nSo I’m not sure how many more times I can read the code to you.  But 8 U.S. Code, 1182 --\nQ    Yes, but you and me talking about it is not how the judicial process works.\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  You've asked the question now eight times.\nQ    One more I’d like to ask you.  One more about a different set of comments.\nMR. SPICER:  You've got -- hold on.  I understand.\nThank you, go ahead.\nQ    About a different set of comments that have been made, Sean, also from Kellyanne Conway earlier this week.\nQ    Let him go.  Let him go.\nQ    Earlier this week.  You say the -- this is in context of Nordstrom and not about what she was counseled about, but about something she said to CNN earlier this week, is that the President doesn't comment on everything.  And so I want to contrast the President’s repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on a Quebec mosque and other similar environments.  Why is the President -- when he chooses to --\nMR. SPICER:  Do you -- hold on -- because you just brought that up.  I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences.  I literally opened the briefing about it.  So for you to sit there and say --\nQ    I was here.\nMR. SPICER:  I know.  So why are you asking why he didn't do it when I literally stood here and did it?\nQ    The President’s statement --\nMR. SPICER:  I don't understand what you're asking.\nQ    Kellyanne’s comments were about that the President doesn't have time to tweet about everything.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    He’s tweeting about this.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    He’s not tweeting about something else.\nMR. SPICER:  I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President spoke --\nQ    I'm talking about the President’s time.\nMR. SPICER:  What are you -- you're equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet?  I don't -- that's the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.\nQ    I’m talking about an attack on Nordstrom on --\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, I’m done.  This is silly.  Okay, next.\nQ    -- and an attack on people, and you're equating --\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  You've asked your question.  Thank you.\nQ    Does that not diminish the language that you're using?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Go ahead.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  One of the criticisms leveled at President Trump’s predecessor, President Obama, by Republicans was his excessive use of executive orders.  The President signed three more executive orders today.  Why isn’t that criticism applicable to President Trump in the same manner that President Obama --\nMR. SPICER:  I think when you look at the context of what they -- yes, what those executive orders did, and there’s things that are within the bounds of trying to protect this country and ordering police officers -- nothing that I think even Democrats would complain, with the exception of the one that we've had conversations on.  Most of them have been widely praised by both parties to keep this country safe, to get jobs creation back.  Most of them have widely applauded.\nI think the difference with what President Obama did was stretch the executive order to take actions that had largely been within the realm of Congress, and to do things that didn't allow for prior input.  The stuff that the President is doing is almost entirely highly applauded by both sides of the aisle and won tremendous praise.  There's a big difference in the context in which those two administrations operated.\nQ    One of the criticisms in addition to that was that President Obama in using those EOs was governing by executive fiat, he wasn’t working with Congress.  Does the President plan to use --\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  But again, I think --\nQ    -- Congress in a legislative manner?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  And I just mentioned both tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare -- immigration.  There are so many areas where the President -- he literally just -- we held up this briefing a little so that eight United States senators could walk out and talk about -- and again, that meeting, while it was focused on the judiciary, they talked about infrastructure.  They talked about other priorities that they have.\nHe has shown a commitment to work across the aisle to bring folks in, to listen, to hear their thoughts, to get ideas on a legislative agenda that they can move together with.  So I think there is a big difference between the last administration that sort of shunned Congress’s role, and this administration where the President is actively seeking their input and ideas, and helping them craft an agenda to move the country forward.\nAlexis.\nQ    Can I follow up on the tax question?\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    Because there are revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act, if it is repealed and replaced -- there has been discussion on the Hill about what would be the appropriate track to get that into tax legislation or how to treat the tax legislation.  If the President is interested in unveiling a tax package that is as comprehensive as you just described, would the revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act be on a separate track?  Or is he talking about folding them into one reconciliation package?\nMR. SPICER:  So right now, as I mentioned at the outset, I think we're primarily looking at two reconciliation tracks -- one utilizing the 2017 budget.  So you could put your Obamacare repeal and replace in the 2017 reconciliation package, and then you could potentially do tax reform -- comprehensive tax reform in the 2018 budget.\nBut I also want to say -- just so we're clear, these aren't prescriptive.  I think we continue to work towards Congress on a range of options and ideas to accomplish both of those and other goals.  Those seem primarily the two most opportune ways to get this thing done.  But I wouldn’t want to rule in or anything out.\nI think both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell are going to weigh in on what best vehicles can be utilized to make this thing happen.  So I don't want to be prescriptive.\nBen.\nQ    You talked about the President’s tax reform plan in coming weeks.  Is that something he’s talked about with leaders in both houses of Congress?  And are they prepared for this?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  I mean, as I mentioned, he has met with -- just wrapped up a meeting with Republicans and Democratic senators.  But this is something that the legislative affairs team, as well as the President himself has engaged with members of Congress to talk about this both privately and in bigger groups.  But there is a very large conversation going on to achieve bipartisan support for a package of this nature.\nJonathan.\nQ    Does the President believe that it’s possible to balance the budget without major entitlement reform?  Any sort of House --\nMR. SPICER:  I think one of the things that the President has looked at is not just the cutting side, but the revenue stream.  One area in particular -- natural resources regulation and tax reform, how we can grow the economy and bring in additional revenues to the government on the revenue side.  So there is a balance to how the President is looking at bringing down the deficit.\nAnd I think before I get -- he’s going to -- we’ll have a budget out in a few weeks.  I think that will answer a lot.  But again, when it comes to deficit reduction, which is something that he is very interested in, that is not a one-side-of-the-ledger option; that a lot of what he is trying to talk about in these meetings and with business executives is how we can expand the economy.  And that expanded economy, that job creation, those explorations of natural resources and additional new jobs also bring additional tax revenue in.\nSo there's a way to do this.  If we start bringing businesses back, creating more things, creating more jobs, that creates a revenue stream that has a significant impact on the deficit -- on being able to drive down the deficit and balancing the budget.\nSo I think it’s not something I want to get in too much detail now, but I will tell you that I think the President has been very, very keen on trying to make sure that we look at the revenue side as much as we're looking at the spending side.\nWhen it comes to the spending side, again, you're looking at a whole-of-government approach at how we look at every department, every agency, every job, the spending -- or the hiring freeze being one of them.  How do we make sure that we're looking at are these positions necessary?  Are they duplicative?  Are we using taxpayer money in the best possible way?\nThose are the whole -- it isn’t a single -- like, look at those particular programs and try to figure out what we can do.  He’s looking at everything and figuring out if we can make it more effective and efficient.\nYes, Scott.\nQ    Yes, Sean, Monday, the House Oversight Committee is going to mark up Congressman Chaffetz’s bill to strike down the District of Columbia's Death with Dignity Act, the assisted suicide law.  It could soon come to the White House.  Has the President articulated any thoughts on that or the other bills to strike down D.C.’s gun laws, marijuana, funding for federal -- for abortions in the District?  Any thoughts on all these things that are coming your way?\nMR. SPICER:  As they come our way and they get passed by both houses and come this way, we will issue statements of administration policy.  At this time, they are not at that position.\nSo thank you, guys, very much.  We’ll see you tomorrow with the Prime Minister.  Take care.\nQ    On Mar-a-Lago --\nQ    One question.\nQ    Come back.\nMR. SPICER:  Sorry, one quick one.  On Mar-a-Lago, someone asked about it yesterday, so a quick follow-up.  The President has offered as a gift to the Prime Minister, he will be his guest at Mar-a-Lago.  No one else will be staying there, as far as I know, from the Japanese delegation.  They will stay out in town with the rest of the staff.  But that is a gift that the President is extending to the Prime Minister.\nThank you, guys.\nEND\n2:26 P.M.

{"source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/background-press-call-prime-minister-abes-visit-white-house", "text": "The White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\nFor Immediate Release\nFebruary 09, 2017\nBACKGROUND PRESS CALL\nBY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS\nON PRIME MINISTER ABE'S VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE\nVia Telephone\n12:04 P.M. EST\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  Today’s briefing will be on background.  You may quote the official as a senior administration official.  With that, I will turn it over to our senior administration official.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thanks, and hi, everyone.  So just before we get started with Q and A, I’ll just say a couple words.  I think that in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, you can see the importance that President Trump has placed on our alliances in the Asia Pacific.  Alliances, in his view, are central to our security and prosperity.  At the end of the day, America is great because of our alliances, and the U.S. recognizes that we have tremendous interests across the region.  The President has already spoken to several of his counterparts across the region, including Japan and Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\nI joined Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on his first trip as Secretary of Defense to Korea, as well as to Japan last week, and Secretary Mattis’ words and deeds, I think, really went a long way toward reassuring our allies that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder, 100 percent, and that we’re seeking to strengthen what are already longstanding and major and important alliances.\nSo it’s really in that light that Prime Minister Abe is visiting, arriving tonight in Washington for a visit that’s going to stretch into the weekend.  He is only the second head of state to visit President Trump since his inauguration.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Minor clarification.  Minor clarification.  Wouldn’t he be more properly described as a head of government?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you -- because of the emperor.  So, and he is also -- or is it because of the Queen actually, in the UK?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, right, exactly.  And Theresa May is head of government and -- right.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I hear you.  So it’s not the first time that he’s met Prime Minister Abe.  Prime Minister Abe was the first leader to (inaudible) President Trump after the election.  They’ve had already a number of conversations, and I think that that really makes clear the importance that the President is placing on that relationship and on the U.S. role in the Asia Pacific region.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, are you ready for questions?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Let’s open it up.\nQ    Hello?  Hey, sorry, the operator was talking, I couldn’t hear.  It’s Margaret Talev with Bloomberg.  Thanks for doing the call.\nFirst of all, just hoping you can walk us through his schedule.  What time is the news conference?  What’s happening tomorrow versus Saturday, yadda yadda?  I also am wondering if you can address -- do you expect any deliverables and/or any reportable developments on nuclear power, on high-speed rail, or on anything bilateral trade-ish, TPP-ish?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Right, okay.  So I think you’re going to get the precise schedule through my colleague's office.  So I'm not going to go into extreme detail just out of fear of giving you bad --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  To clarify that, you'll get it through main press.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  But just some of the highlights -- the Prime Minister and his delegation are going to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office tomorrow.  They are going to have a conversation that's going to cover a very wide range of subjects dealing with the bilateral relationship, the security piece of the relationship, as well as the economic, and also talking about matters of mutual interest regionally and globally as well.\nAfter that, there is going to be a working lunch.  It will be a slightly larger grouping of people.  And that lunch will probably delve more deeply into the economic piece of the relationship.  And from there, the President and the Prime Minister are going to travel down to Palm Beach, where the Prime Minister and his wife will be guests of President Trump for the weekend.  And I imagine that there will be a fair bit of golf involved, as well as more time together eating and just relaxing really down at Mar-a-Lago.\nQ    News conference?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The second part in terms of deliverables -- I'll leave it to the Japanese to talk in more concrete terms about what might be announced in the way of concrete deliverables on the economic side.  But I can tell you that the U.S. and Japan represent together 30 percent of the world's GDP.  We share an interest in sustaining a strong global economy, ensuring financial stability, and ensuring job growth in both countries.  And Prime Minister Abe is well acquainted with President Trump's priorities, which you could sum up in three words -- jobs, jobs, jobs -- when it comes to the economic relationship.\nAnd so I think that they'll have pretty in-depth discussions about the overall relationship as well as reaffirming the interest in seeing a free and rules-based trading order in the region.  But I'll leave it to you and your colleagues in the press to extract from the Japanese any concrete deliverables that might come.\nQ    My question is about whether the Senkaku Islands will be on the agenda and whether President Trump, given his track record of being willing to break from previous U.S. policy, would be considering taking a different position on the sovereignty of the Senkakus, particularly in light of his effort to create leverage in negotiations with China.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Got it.  Brian, good to hear your voice.  So on the Senkakus, the standing U.S. policy has been that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Article 5 of that treaty does apply to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which we recognize as being administered by Japan.  That certainly is the Trump administration’s policy, as well.  And I can -- I would expect certainly for you to hear on that subject and in fairly concrete terms that President Trump is committed to that treaty and it extending.  We oppose any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japan’s administration of the islands.\nAs for the question of sovereignty, that is really something that I would not expect to see addressed in this visit.\nQ    Thanks for doing the call.  I wanted to get a question on color that shapes how Prime Minister Abe became the recipient of this sort of informal summit, the first of this President, how that came about, and whether or not that means that the President will have more sort of unfettered time to talk about issues in a sort of different context than he would in the White House.\nAnd then I didn't hear you address whether there would be a news conference -- to Margaret’s question.\nAnd just lastly on the question of trade, kind of dovetailing with what Brian was asking with respect to China, are there things on the agenda that would allow the Trump administration to move forward with the Japanese on any sort of bilateral trade agreement that would supplant TPP?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Got it.  Okay, so in terms of color about how this summit came about, I think that it was a natural result of the foundation that was laid before the inauguration with Prime Minister Abe’s early visit.  And it was the natural result of the President’s belief that our alliances are central to our success, both in terms of security and prosperity in the region.\nAs to whether there will be other meetings that follow a sort of -- a casual format, or what you call “unfettered” time together, I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case.  The President does have a -- believes in getting to know leaders that he knows he’s going to be spending a lot of time dealing with.  And on relationships that are important to him, he believes he can get the measure of the people through more informal settings.  And so I imagine that he’ll make use of time outside of Washington, D.C., with leaders from time to time.\nAs for a news conference, my colleague can confirm, but, yes, there will be a press conference tomorrow after the -- I believe it’s after the meeting in the Oval Office.\nAnd on trade discussions, the President I think has made pretty clear that he believes that bilateral agreements are really the way to go for the United States, that in a bilateral agreement you can negotiate terms that are more favorable to the United States than you can negotiate in a multilateral agreement, where sometimes you’re held to the standard of the weakest link in the compact.\nSo I’m not going to get ahead of discussions tomorrow to see where discussions go.  But I think that this is a first -- it’s really a first summit since they’ve come into office, so they’re going to be talking on a pretty wide range of subjects and certainly touching on possible paths forward with relation to the overall economic relationship.  But we’ll leave it at that.\nQ    Thank you so much for the call, guys.  And thank you for giving me an opportunity to ask a question.  What I wanted to ask you is, there is a certain attempt to forge closer ties between Japan and Russia.  There has been recently a meeting between President Putin and Prime Minister Abe.  And we see a general -- I don’t know if I want to use the word rapprochement between the two countries -- well, certainly something like that is taking place.  I wanted to ask you -- does the Trump administration have any objections to that?  Or do you encourage that?  How do you view those bilateral attempts between Russia and Japan?  Thank you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks very much.  We certainly understand that Japan, as a neighbor of Russia, puts high importance on its own bilateral relations with Russia.  And the United States respects that and isn’t seeking to interfere with Prime Minister Abe’s priorities in his dealings with Russia.  But I’ll leave it to Prime Minister Abe and his government to talk in detail about that bilateral relationship.\nQ    I wanted to ask if you had any specific item that the President is expected to push Prime Minister Abe on.  For example, currency manipulation does seem to be a subject of those around him that has been stressed throughout TPP negotiations from the Republican side.  Thank you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, I mean, the President’s comments the other day about currency manipulation weren’t the first comments he’s made about his views on that subject.  I think that over the course of a long weekend together, the two leaders are going to cover a pretty broad range of subjects.  I don’t think that’s necessarily a -- I can tell you that’s not something that’s at the top of the list, but whether it comes up naturally in conversation, we’ll see over the course of that meeting.\nQ    Hi, this is Kyle Cardine from Fuji TV.  First, I wanted to ask, yesterday Sean Spicer said he would take the question in regards to who was paying for Prime Minister Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago.  And also we have one more from our bureau chief.\nQ    Hi, the President the other day said that Japan is sending hundreds of thousands of cars with big ships, but U.S. cannot sell its cars in Japan.  But, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan, and also the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States.  How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'm sorry, the line went a little fuzzy just at the end of your bureau chief's question.  I'm sorry, if you could repeat that.\nQ    My question is, the President said the U.S. cannot sell its own cars in Japan, but, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan for U.S. cars.  And also, the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States because they are producing most of the cars in the U.S.  How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion?  Thank you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Right.  Okay, so on who's paying for the visit, I'd defer to Sean Spicer to get back to you on that, since I'm not directly involved with the logistics.  I'm sure that whatever arrangement was made --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can address that.  The visit to Mar-a-Lago is a personal gift of -- I don’t know exactly how we're phrasing it, but it's something that the President is doing for the Prime Minister.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Got it.  And on your second one, I would really -- what I'd like to do is defer to my colleague who's actually working on the economic piece in more detail than I am on this visit.  And he's not on the line, so my excuse to dodge the question -- the import tax.  But automobiles is certainly going to be an important topic of conversation in both directions, because it's such an iconic and critical part of the Japanese economy.  It's of high interest to President Trump.  And I'm sure that that will come up in discussion.\nQ    Hey, it's Olivier Knox at Yahoo! News.  I have a couple for you.  The first one is, unless I missed it, the President has not yet spoken to Xi Jinping.  Is there, beyond the sort of symbolic importance of this, are you sending a deliberate message by doing that?  And then, specifically for you, what's the President's position in terms of North Korea in terms of a six-party-like approach or unilateral pressure?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So in terms of -- you're right that the President Trump has not spoken with President Xi Jinping.  The two have exchanged letters.  Xi Jinping had sent a congratulatory letter on the day of the President's inauguration.  And President Trump yesterday sent a letter to Xi Jinping really to wish President Xi and the people of China a happy Lantern Festival -- the Lantern Festival is on Saturday.  I recommend you going and getting those soup dumplings somewhere in the D.C. area -- (laughter) -- which is fun to do.  And, of course, a prosperous and healthy year of the rooster, as well.\nThe President, in his note to Xi Jinping, stated that he believes that having a constructive relationship with China would be something that would serve the fundamental interests of both of our countries and really the region in the world more widely, and that he does look forward to discussing matters of mutual cooperation, as well as delving into some of the well-known differences in the relationship.  So they are in contact.\nTo your second question about six-party talks and the like, I'd say that it's right now premature to detail a North Korea strategy on the part of the Trump administration.  And in time we'll have more that we'll be prepared to say about that.  Japan and the United States both strongly urge North Korea not to take provocative acts.  And, of course, were they to do so, that would be information that would feed into and inform a Trump administration approach to the DPRK.\nQ    The Japanese I’ve spoken with since the campaign have obviously been quite nervous about some of the rhetoric that they heard from the President back on the campaign trail about paying more for the bases and wouldn’t mind perhaps if Japan and South Korea built their own nuclear weapons.  What is -- how is the President going to assure Prime Minister Abe that the United States truly has its back and that there’s no need for the Japanese to worry that the United States isn’t going to be there for its defense?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  I think the way he’ll do it is both in words and in actions, and those words and actions are already taking place.\nSecretary of Defense Mattis, who the President had asked to visit the region, made very clear statements about the strength of the alliance, that these alliances and our commitment to them are unwavering and really the cornerstone of prosperity, security and freedom in the Asia Pacific region.\nSo I think that you’re going to hear similar messages from the President himself.  And I think that that will go a long way towards dispelling any doubts that may still remain, or Japanese and Korean and friends and other friends and allies throughout the region.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Thank you for doing that.  Thanks, everybody, for joining.  We appreciate it.\nEND\n12:30 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:48 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Just a few minutes ago, as many of you had seen, we had another example of the real-world results that the Trump administration is getting in its pro-jobs agenda.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that his company is opening a high-tech manufacturing facility in Arizona that will create roughly 10,000 jobs between the factory itself and its supply chain, which is the latest wave in economic optimism that's sweeping the country following the President's victory.\nIn his inaugural address, the President laid out an ambitious vision to create 25 million jobs over the next decade.  From the beginning of his campaign, bringing jobs back to our struggling community has been one of the parts of the President's message that most resonated with the American people.  Having hired tens of thousands of people himself, the President is keenly aware of what prevents businesses from being successful and creating jobs in the current economy.\nPresident Obama, by contrast, visited the same factory site where this factory will be built during his last reelection visit in 2012, touting the government incentives that were supposed to bring back jobs that had been lost to Asia.  President Trump knows that for business, the real government incentive is the government restraining itself.  For too many years, Washington has smothered industry in this country and under burdensome regulation.  This administration will set out to free businesses from constraints of government bureaucracy and regulation.\nUnder the President's \"Buy American, Hire American\" agenda, the government is going to get out of the way of businesses to allow them to thrive.  Just last week, the President signed what we've been calling the \"one in, two out\" executive order requiring that every new federal regulation that's adopted, two be eliminated.  This new rule will provide much-needed relief for businesses who have been regulated and saddled with an absolutely staggering amount of additional red tape, as much as $1.9 trillion per year by some estimates.\nIn 2014, the National Association of Manufacturers calculated that companies in every industry paid an average of $9,991 per employee to comply with federal regulations.  And it's only gotten worse since that study was conducted.  By relieving even a small portion of this burden, we will allow businesses to grow and hire more people.  Projects that have been stalled or scuttled are being revived in anticipation of the President's pro-growth policies.  Last quarter, confidence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies jumped by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey, one of the single-largest quarter gains in history.  This is only the beginning of the President's agenda.\nMoving on to recap the President's afternoon and evening yesterday, as you saw, we officially announced the 24 people who will be serving in the President's -- in his Cabinet, on the White House website yesterday.  The President looks forward to having all these distinguished qualified men and women in place as heads of departments and agencies so that our government can start fully working for the American people and enacting the agenda that he brought forward during the last campaign.\nThe President spoke with two foreign leaders yesterday.  During his call with President Rajoy of Spain, the two leaders discussed our shared priorities, including efforts to eliminate ISIS.  The President additionally reiterated the United States' commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and emphasized the importance of NATO allies and sharing the burden of defense spending.  President Trump also spoke with President Erdogan of Turkey, during which he conveyed U.S. support to Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally, and welcomed Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS.\nLast night, the President had an incredibly meaningful visit with current officers who enrolled in the Green Beret's Qualifications Course.  These young men and women will be at the tip of the spear serving our country in some of the world's most dangerous places as intelligence officers.  The President told these brave young soldiers how proud he was of their commitment, to risk everything to keep us safe, and how humbled he was to serve as their Commander-in-Chief, and that they could always count on him to have their back.\nAlso, yesterday, the Department of Justice presented its arguments before the 9th Circuit Court in the case concerning the temporary restraining order on the President's national security executive order.  Again, as I did yesterday, I want to emphasize that the issue before the 9th Circuit right now is extremely narrow.  The question is simply whether or not the President's executive order, which we maintain is fully lawful under the Constitution and U.S. code, should remain in effect while the courts actually consider it on its merits.  We expect the court to issue a decision on this matter soon, and we will have a statement once that's done.\nToday, the President spoke before the Major Cities police chiefs and the Major County Sheriffs Winter Conference.  In his remarks, the President reiterated his commitment to a great national partnership between his administration and law enforcement.  While there are many things that the federal government can do to improve safety in our communities, it truly rests with the police officers, sheriffs and deputies who risk their lives every day on our streets.  And their mission is critical to the future of this country.  These brave men and women have a true friend in the White House.  And as the President said many times, we must protect those who protect us.  He will continue to do that throughout his administration.\nLater this afternoon, the President will participate in a standing legislative strategy meeting of his team here.  The team has been working around the clock to engage lawmakers and get the President's agenda moving through Congress.\nYesterday, the Vice President attended the Republican Policy lunch where he discussed how the administration will work with the Senate to deliver results for the American people.\nOf course, the Vice President also cast a historic vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on the floor of the Senate, and then later swore her in in his office across the street.\nThe larger intergovernmental affairs team is maintaining direct communications to state, local and tribal leaders so that we know what issues are affecting local communities.  So far, they've contacted all GOP state speakers of the house, state senate presidents, and attorneys general, and all but eight GOP state Senate majority leaders.\nOur legislative team is also obviously engaged in Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  He had another full day of meetings in the Senate with both Republicans and Democrats.  He met this morning with Senators Flake and Heitkamp.  And this afternoon he'll meet with Senators Cotton, Blumenthal, McCaskill and Heller.  We're also pleased to see another Democrat, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, come out and say that the eminently qualified Judge Gorsuch deserves an up or down vote.  That brings up now to nine total Democrats who have come out and expressed a willingness to treat Judge Gorsuch fairly.  We hope more Democrats will continue to join their colleagues in fulfilling their constitutional duty to offer advice and consent on the President's nominee.\nAlso, on the Hill, we expect Attorney General-designate Sessions to receive a full vote on the floor of the Senate tonight.  As unfortunately has become commonplace in the Senate, Democrats once again spent hours last night in a counterproductive discussion about one of President's clearly qualified nominees, not to mention one of their peers.  Senator Sessions has a long and distinguished legal career, serving as both the U.S. attorney of the southern district of Alabama, and also as Alabama's attorney general.\nThe President looks forward to Senator Sessions's return to the Department of Justice where he will continue his service to our nation as our chief law enforcement officer.  We also anticipate votes later this week on Secretary-designate Price and Mnuchin.\nFinally, before I open it up for questions, the White House has spoken with the governor of Louisiana about the severe where in the Gulf Coast.  We've also made contact with the mayors of the affected areas.  FEMA is monitoring the situation around the clock and is in the process of deploying teams to support response and recovery activities.  At this time, there have been no additional requests for federal assistance, and we'll update you should that change.\nWith that, let me go to the first question from Courtis Fuller from WLWT NBC in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nQ    Good afternoon.  Cincinnati, among other cities, has recently voted to become a sanctuary city.  City leaders here are vowing not to enforce federal immigration laws without a specific request.  They also say they want to be open and welcoming to refugees.  My question today:  How will President Trump respond?  Will Cincinnati face economic or other sanctions, including, for example, funding of the Brent Spence Bridge, which he said he would fund when he was on the campaign trail?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Courtis.  As I've noted before, at the end of the day, this order is about two things: one, keeping our cities safe, and two, respecting the hard-earned taxpayers who send their money to the federal government.  And the President is going to do everything he can within the scope of the executive order to make sure that cities who don’t comply with it -- counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding in compliance with the executive order.  I think more areas like Miami-Dade, down in Florida, understand the importance of this order, and we hope cities like Cincinnati and other communities around the country follow their lead and comply with that.\nWith that, Anita Kumar.\nQ    I have two questions.  The first one is, can you tell us who is paying or how this is happening with Prime Minister Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago?  Who will be paying for that?  I asked the White House yesterday.  They referred me to State.  State referred me to the Japanese government who didn’t respond.  It seems as if the Prime Minister was paying and the money was going to Treasury, as previously discussed before.\nMR. SPICER:  You mean when he travels here or to Florida?\nQ    Mar-a-Lago.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.\nQ    Then it seems the White House would know that.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, and let me get back to you on that.  We’ll follow up with you on the exact financing.  I’m not sure how that flows, but I’d be glad to find out.\nQ    Okay.  Second question was, during the hearing yesterday that you talked about -- 9th Circuit -- there was some discussion about whether there needed to be a tweak to the executive order to make it clear that legal permanent residents would not be included in that, and there was some back and forth on that.  Will there be a tweak?\nQ    I think there was further guidance that I spoke about that went out, I think it’s been a week ago -- correct me if I’m wrong -- and talked about, we wanted to make it very, very clear that legal permanent residents were not included in that.\nBut again, remember, we’re not talking about the merits of the order.  Right now, this discussion that happened last night and that the court will be ruling on is specific to the temporary restraining order and whether or not it should be maintained until there’s a further discussion on the merits.\nSo again, I don’t want to get into the legal nuances, but right now the guidance is very clear that was issued several days ago, if not a week ago, that this is not about legal permanent residents.  So I just -- that they are excluded from this, and I don’t know why there would be that discussion.  That clarification has been made.\nJeff.\nQ    Sean, you said you’re not talking about the merits of the order.  Was the President this morning talking about the merits of the order when he called it “disgraceful,” the hearing that he heard last night?\nMR. SPICER:  He wasn’t arguing before the 9th Circuit, Jeff.  Last night was a motion before the 9th Circuit on the temporary restraining order.  I think the President was very clear that U.S. code and the Constitution clearly give the President all the authority that is needed to make sure that he can regulate who comes into this country and prevent any acts of -- you know, anyone who is not coming to this country in a peaceful manner.\nThe code, 8 U.S. Code 1152* [1182], is very, very clear on this.  And so I think the President was pointing out the same issue that we had in Boston, which is, once we had a chance to argue it on the merits, we won on it.  And so I think that’s what he’s -- he clearly did not argue in front of the 9th Circuit last night.  So --\nQ    But he called it “disgraceful.”  By calling it “disgraceful,” is that the type of language that should be used between branches of government?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that the President, when you look at the U.S. code and how clear it’s written and the authority and power it gives the President to do what is necessary to keep this country safe and regulate who comes into this country, I think it’s a very, very clear reading, and the President was very -- I think he further went on and said, it doesn’t matter what level of education you’re at, I don’t think you could misread this.\nSo I think --\nQ    But isn’t that insulting an appointee to the federal bench?\nMR. SPICER:  I think he was very clear, Jeff.  So thank you.\nDaniel Halper.\nQ    I was curious about the tweet that President Trump -- about his daughter’s brand, and then it was retweeted by the POTUS account.  What’s the standard that the President is doing in regards to his family businesses or that businesses --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think this was less about his family business and an attack on his daughter.  He ran for President.  He won.  He’s leading this country.  And I think for people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive order on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.\nSo, look, when it comes to his family, I think he’s been very clear how proud he is of what they do and what they’ve accomplished, and for someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just -- is not acceptable, and the President has every right as a father to stand up for them.\nI'm going to go to Norma Garcia from KXTX.\nQ    Thank you.  In Texas there is a big push to penalize sanctuary cities.  In this state and other states around the country, there is a growing concern among undocumented immigrants whose lives are deeply rooted in the United States and have no criminal records.  My question is, is this administration ready to tackle comprehensive immigration reform?  If so, can you give us a timeline for it?  If not, what is the plan to deal with undocumented immigrants who live in this country long term?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Norma.  I think this has come up several times.  I don't think that anybody doubts the President's concern or priority that is placed on immigration.  He has talked about it -- when you talk about a comprehensive approach, he has talked about building a wall, he's talked about making sure we go after criminals in this country, he's talked about walking through the process and addressing DACA and DAPA in time.  I think this is a big problem.  There is no question that both on the security side and on reforming the current immigration system that is so clearly broken, that he is walking through this already, both in terms of executive action and then will continue to work through Congress.\nSo to your question about the timeline, I think he's already enacting several pieces of it and he's going to work with Congress to get further down that.\nEamon Javers.\nQ    Sean --\nMR. SPICER:  Hallie.\nQ    Two here.  Playing off of questions from Daniel here, on the business activities that you describe the President taking offense to, Nordstrom has come out and says this was not a political decision, it was a business decision.  Ivanka Trump, as you know, has said she has divorced herself, separated herself from the business.  So how is she being treated unfairly if she's not part of --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's clearly a targeting of her brand, and it's her name still out there.  So she's not directly running the company, it's still her name on it and there's clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father's positions on particular policies that he's taken.  This is a direct attack on his policies and her name.  And so there is clearly an attempt for him to stand up for her because she is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ    Sean, just a second -- actually, to clarify that, the timing of that tweet?  It looked like it was right after his PDB -- during?  Can you just --\nMR. SPICER:  I've heard the conjecture.  He was free when that happened.  Thank you for asking.\nQ    Second question was on the lawsuit --\nMR. SPICER:  No, that's two.\nQ    Oh, I'm sorry, that was a clarification of the one.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Good, Hallie.\nQ    The President tweeted today that if he does not prevail in the court, talking about the lawsuit issue, that we will never be safe, we will never have the safety and security we're entitled to.  What does that mean?  Does that mean that this is the only tool in his toolbox and if this EO gets batted down by the courts, we're toast?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  But I think that when you -- and I mean, again, let's -- 8 U.S. Code 1182 says whenever the President finds that the entry of an alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation such periods as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of aliens or any class of aliens or immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens restrictions he may deem necessary and appropriate.\nI guess at some point, if you don't look at that statute and say that the President has the power that Congress and the President have deemed necessary to keep this country safe, you've got to wonder how far you're going to allow that to get eroded.\nSo the point is, is that at some area, you've got to wonder if the President isn't able to execute on the power that's been vested into him and is codified in U.S. code, at some point you have to wonder what else is at question.  We have a President that acted 100 percent lawfully to keep people out of this country from seven countries that we did not have the proper information to ensure they were coming into this country with the appropriate means and motives.  If at some point the President doesn't have the power, as given to him in law, to protect this country, I think that really questions what a slippery slope we're on.\nJohn.\nQ    Sean, two questions.\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.  (Laughter.)\nQ    The President said this morning that he paid very close attention to the arguments before the 9th last night.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    But was he happy with the presentation that the DOJ attorney, August Flentje, made?  There was some concern by supporters of this extreme vetting program that he wasn’t strong enough.  He seemed to be searching for answers, particularly on the point of standing.\nMR. SPICER:  I think there was a lot of back and forth during that entire argument.  He made some solid points, and I think that he did what he had to represent the President’s case and to represent the administration’s case on the TRO.\nI think the President has really focused on the merits of this case, and looking forward to getting it back either to the 9th Circuit or to the lower court, or however it has to move.  He feels very confident on the merits, and that's where I think his focus has been.\nSo I don't -- I’m not concerned.  I think the President’s main concern has been on the merits of this case and making sure that an executive order that was lawfully executed and went through the entire process -- remember we've got to go back and remember that the DOJ’s Office of Legal Compliance vetted this order, deemed it was legal.  So we've followed the entire process to make sure that this was done correctly, constitutionally, legally, and every otherwise.\nAnd so to now -- now our focus is making sure, whether or not we have to wait a day or two or whatever for the TRO, we look forward to the opportunity to discuss this on the merits.\nJen Jacobs.\nQ    Whoa, whoa, whoa -- sorry.  Hold on.  Just as a point of clarification -- I’ve got a question --\nMR. SPICER:  Now you're going with Halle's --\nQ    So he is -- he was happy with his presentation --\nMR. SPICER:  I think he is looking forward to the merits of this discussion.  That's where -- and I think he was pleased with some of the points that got made.  But his focus is on the merits of the order and making sure that ultimately we're able to do what we can to get this order back in place and protect the American people.\nJen.\nQ    The Muslim Brotherhood --\nQ    Question two.\nMR. SPICER:  Look at what Hallie started.  (Laughter.)\nQ    We have reported that Russia has sent its biggest shipment of missiles ever to Syria.  Just wondering what the White House’s reaction is.\nMR. SPICER:  I think I'll have to -- we don't have any comment on this at this time.\nJen.\nQ    The Muslim Brotherhood.  Is it accurate that the administration is weighing -- labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization?  And will you do the same for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard?\nMR. SPICER:  I think there is no one that can question the President’s commitment to fully attacking and addressing the threat that we face by radical Islamic terrorism.  He has been -- made very clear during the campaign that the first step is understanding, knowing, and proclaiming who the enemy is.  And he’s going to do whatever it takes.\nThat being said, I’m not going to get ahead of any announcements that we may or may not have coming in the near future.  But make no mistake, the President understands the threat that our nation faces, and he’s going to do everything he can to attack it, root it out, and destroy it.\nCecilia.\nQ    Thank you.  The President also said today that in the last two weeks he’s learned a lot, and that terrorism is far greater -- and that terrorism is a far greater threat than people understand.  That sounds like he is telling the American public that they have something to fear.  Is there a specific threat that he is talking about?  And should the American public -- based on that statement right there -- be fearful?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  But I think the American people should understand that the President is committed to doing this.  We face a very, very real threat in ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism, and that we've got to do everything he can, and that the reason that he is taking the steps that he is, is because we must remain ever vigilant.  We can't let our guard down.  We have to be ahead of the curve.  And that the President is going to take the steps necessary to protect this country and its people.  And that the idea that we should sit back and not fully appreciate the constant threat that we're in, it’s week after week, month after month that we're hearing of another instance -- a lone wolf, et cetera, et cetera -- that is going throughout this country -- excuse me, throughout the world.  My apologies.\nAnd so I think what the President is doing is trying to make sure that the American people understand that he’s doing everything he can to protect them and to keep our institutions and our people safe.  And so this is not something that we can rest on our laurels, that we can't understand.  He was just down at CENTCOM and SOCOM Monday morning getting a full briefing of the threat that we face from around the world and their motives.\nAnd I think that that's something that he weighs very heavily on his mind when he meets with these people, gets these briefings, meets with the Green Beret soldiers, that he recognizes that there are so many people out there putting their life on the line to protect this country and to make sure that we understand the threats, and that it’s his job and his obligation to do everything within his power to take that information and do what he can to protect the country.\nAnd so just to put a pin in it, I just want to be clear.  While we may not face an imminent threat today, we don't know when that next threat comes.  Is it next week?  Is it next month?  Is it next year?  But the President wants to get ahead of the curve and make sure that we're not talking about what we should have done, but taking every step necessary to make sure that it doesn't happen.\nSteve.\nQ    But is the threat today greater than it was yesterday or last week?  Because that's what he’s saying.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand what he’s saying.  What I’m telling you is, is that we shouldn’t ever be behind the curve on the threats this country faces.  We should make sure -- we don't know when the next one is coming.  We don't know when the next lone wolf is coming.  We don't know when the next attack is.  We've got amazing intelligence that's trying to root out and make sure that it doesn't happen again.  But what we can't do is wait for the next attack to come and say, I wish we had done the following.  And the steps that he's taken are proactively making this country and our people safer.\nSteve.\nQ    Sean, what was the White House response to the Republican proposal for a carbon tax floated today?  And separately, could you just set up tomorrow's meeting with the airline CEOs a little bit?  What do you hope to get out of it?  What do you hope to discuss?\nMR. SPICER:  So I'm not going to comment on pending legislation.  We'll wait to see where that comes.  That's just not going to be a habit of ours to comment on every bill that gets introduced or marked up in committee until we have a statement of administration policy.\nAnd with respect to the meeting tomorrow, I'll have a further readout on that later tomorrow.  But I will say, in general, as you know, he's met with Intel just now.  He met with oil executives -- I mean, executives from the car manufacturers, manufacturing companies, technological companies, unions.  So these continued meetings that you'll see in the next months and years are going to be an attempt to make sure that he's sitting down with business leaders from around the country to figure out how he can use his office and this administration to further their ability to create jobs and grow the economy.\nSo this is going to be more of a pattern.  You're going to continue to see him meeting with people who want to share that agenda to grow, create jobs, manufacture here, lift wages up here, bring benefits to good-paying jobs, et cetera.\nQ    Should we take any significance from the fact that you did have this meeting about the carbon tax?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  I just -- look, we're not at a policy -- we have nothing to announce on that.\nIf I can go now to our next seat -- sorry -- we've got Josh Smith from WJHL in Southwest Virginia.\nQ    First off, thanks so much for taking questions from journalists covering local news.  We appreciate it.  WJHL is in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia -- that is coal country.  And I have two questions relating to coal.  Then-candidate Trump came to Abingdon, Virginia last year and he made a bold promise -- if it helped to rescue the mining industry, that he would help to bring coal jobs and he would push back against environmental regulations.\nIf the executive order last week was a first step, what specifically is the President willing to do, planning to do to make good on that promise to help the coal industry, to encourage coal production and use, and to deal with what some call its demonized image?\nAnd as a follow-up -- and I've got to ask two questions because when am I ever going to get to do this again?  What assurances can the President give those who hear him talking about him pushing back against environmental regulations and bringing back coal?  What assurances can he give those who are very worried about the impact on the environment?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that there's this -- well, I think when you hear him talk about coal specifically, it's under the guise of clean coal.  And I think the technology that we're able to utilize these days make it one of the cleanest uses of technology that we have.  And the President's point is that as we bring back this industry, we can do it in a way that is environmentally friendly and it becomes a great and greater energy source for us.\nJust the other day, the Department of Energy noted that we expect I think it's about a 3 percent increase in coal production in this country, which is a noticeable reverse of where it's been in the past.  You mentioned the executive order and the talks that the President has had over the past year or so about his desire to bring back coal.\nLargely, that has to do with regulation that the EPA has put on existing coal plants that have ensured that they couldn't operate in an effective way to stay open.  I think the President is working with industry to roll back a lot of that and do it in a way that's environmental-friendly.  And I think that you can do that utilizing the technology you have and harness the power of clean coal, Josh.  Thanks.\nKristen.\nQ    Sean, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run special operations in ground missions against suspected terrorists in the wake of the recent raid there that claimed so many civilian lives.  Does that not undercut the administration's ability to fight terrorism in that region?  And do you stand by your assessment that it's a success?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I'll take the last one first.  It's absolutely a success.  And I think anyone who would suggest it's not a success does disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens.  He fought knowing what was at stake in that mission.  And anybody who would suggest otherwise doesn't fully appreciate how successful that mission was, what the information that they were able to retrieve was, and how that will help prevent future terrorist attacks.\nQ    But even Senator John McCain --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  I think my statement is very clear on that, Kristen.  I think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens.\nQ    Are you saying that Senator John McCain owes him an apology?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, Kristen, can I answer the question?  I'm answering the question.  Please let me finish.  The raid -- the action that was taken in Yemen was a huge success.  American lives will be saved because of it.  Future attacks will be prevented.  The life of Chief Ryan Owens was done in service to this country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information that we received during that raid.  I think any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions that he took.  Full stop.  I'm sorry, what was the first part?\nQ    Is that your message to Senator John McCain?  He's called it a failure.\nMR. SPICER:  That's my message to anybody who says that.  Anybody.  I just -- I don't know how much clearer I can be, Kristen.\nHunter Walker.\nQ    Yes, thank you, Sean.  This morning, President Trump asked local law enforcement officials to help assist with deportations.  If he doesn't get the cooperation he's hoping for, does he plan to have DHS and CBP proactively begin deportations of undocumented criminals in the border zone?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that when you talk about immigration and what he's doing -- whether it's the wall or enforcing existing regulations or visa reform -- I don't think anybody questions the President's commitment to border security and immigration reform.  In fact, it's usually quite the opposite.  So when it comes to the steps that he's going to take, I think I've addressed this multiple times what his priorities are going to be, but you've seen Secretary Kelly talk about construction of the wall, his implementation of the executive order to keep people out.  There is going to be a considerable amount of action on this front -- on immigration and border security.  It started day one and it's going to continue through the last possible day until the President feels that this border is 100 percent secure and we've got the immigration system completely under control.\nQ    Is defunding his only tool to get cooperation from the sanctuary cities?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I'm not going to get ahead of it.  I think when you saw the support and some of the side conversations that the sheriffs and police officers had, and the conversations that we've had beyond that, the sheriffs the other day, the support that they've issued on behalf of his executive actions and his agenda as a whole -- these are the folks on the front lines in many cases, Hunter, that are on the border, that see what some of this does and how it affects families and businesses, not to mention the cost that it is to both our country, in terms of what we have to do to support the immigration at our southern border in particular, but also the cost that it has on our economy and on jobs.\nSo you’re going to continue to see a flurry of activity, over and over and over again, to make sure that this President continues to show the importance that he puts on both border security and immigration reform.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Yesterday, on CNN, Kellyanne Conway announced that Prime Minister Trudeau is going to be here next week.  Can you confirm which day?  Have discussions on reviewing the Canadian part of NAFTA started?  And can you confirm that Sarah Palin is being considered as ambassador to Ottawa?\nMR. SPICER:  So I will have further updates on the Prime Minister’s schedule either later today or tomorrow.  I’m not in a position where I can finalize that.  But we will have --\nQ    And all the other (inaudible) --\nMR. SPICER:  Guys, slow your roll.  (Laughter.)  So we will -- with respect to the ambassador, we have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front.  I’m sure, at some point, we will have soon.\nWith respect to the agenda, as the President spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau a few weeks ago, they talked about trade and security and commerce, and I think all of that is going to be discussed at the time when the President and him further meet or discuss this.\nQ    And I wanted to follow up on that if you don’t mind.  Just on NATO, Canada, of course, is one of the 28 member countries.  The President has been calling out countries that pay their fair share of dues.  What are his options if countries don’t listen to him?  And what does this really mean?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think -- look, every country is obligated to pay two percent of their GDP, and the President has made it very clear that, for too long, many countries have been getting a free ride.  When he has talked to these countries, and as I’ve just read out, both Erdogan and Rajoy -- he has addressed this not just with them, but to so many of the other NATO countries.  And, by and large, every single one of them agrees with that.  They understand the importance of NATO, and the President is very clear that in order for NATO to be successful, these folks have to pay their fair share.\nCarol Lee.\nQ    I want to follow on Kristen, and then I just have a question on Turkey.  Does the White House have a reaction to reports that Yemen has revoked permission for the U.S. to do ground missions there?\nMR. SPICER:  Yemen, more than most countries, fully appreciates the fight that we have with ISIS, and I think we’re going to continue to work with them to strengthen our diplomatic relationships and understand our fight against terrorism.  And so at this point, I’ll leave it at as that we understand that we share that commitment with them, and we’re going to continue to work with them to combat ISIS and to make sure that we do that.  I’m not in a position to go any further at this time.\nQ    President Erdogan said today that the U.S. agreed to work with Turkey to take Raqqa.  Can you clarify what the President said to him in that phone call?\nMR. SPICER:  I can’t.  I think the readout was as specific as we want to get with his conversation.\nQ    What's his characterization of the conversation?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the readout that we put out on Turkey was as far as we want to go with that.  Thank you.\nHold on, I’m going to go to our last one, Adriana Cohen, a radio host and columnist for the Boston Herald.\nQ    Great to be with you, Sean.  Last night, Boston Mayor Walsh went on a television show to talk about sanctuary cities.  What does the President make of his vow to house illegal immigrants in Boston City Hall to shield them from the Trump administration?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President’s executive order is pretty clear when it comes to these kind of actions.  Again, I referenced it earlier in the briefing, but it’s twofold.  One is, there’s a concern about the safety of the American people and how we let people come into this country, and second, with respect to the American taxpayer.  And if we’re going to be sending federal tax dollars to folks to Washington, I think they need to be used appropriately.  And the President is going to do everything in his power to respect the money that taxpayers send to Washington and is spent facilitating legal activities and on American citizens.\nBlake.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Earlier today, the President said that the wall is in the process of being designed.  Given his previous background, is he or does he plan on being actively involved with the designing and the implementation of that wall?  And separately, last night, Elizabeth Warren -- any reaction from the White House on whether you believe what Mitch McConnell did was the correct thing?  Critics say she was silenced on the Senate floor.\nMR. SPICER:  On the wall, I mean, the President is a builder.  He understands and I think he’s going to make sure that as this project moves forward, that he’s going to stay in close touch with Secretary Kelly to make sure that it fits his specs.  But he takes enormous attention to detail, and he wants to make sure it gets done right.  So I would expect that a project of this magnitude and one that is this high on his priority list will get the necessary attention from the President.\nQ    And Senator Warren?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m sorry?\nQ    Senator Warren last night?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, look, I would refer you back to Senate rules.  I mean, this is not something that we tend to discuss here.  I’ll leave it to Senator McConnell and the Senate to discuss Senate rules.\nQ    I just wanted to follow up again on Yemen.  Just not sure exactly what you’re trying to say here.  I seems like the report was that the Yemeni government has asked the U.S. to stop doing any ground operations with regard to AQAP.  Is that the request that you got from the Yemeni government?\nMR. SPICER:  We'll have further information on that going forward.  I think we are in touch with Yemeni officials.  We’re working this through diplomatic channels.  But they understand the fight and the commitment that we both share when it comes to rooting out ISIS.  And I’ll have more information on that going forward.\nQ    So can I ask on the President’s tweet, Hallie had mentioned on part of it.  The other part of it this morning was that there’s been a big increase in traffic to the U.S. from certain areas.  Can you say what certain areas he’s referring to, and what data is he leaning on?\nMR. SPICER:  I’ll get back to you on that.  I’ve got to pull the data field on that.\nMargaret.\nQ    Sean, two questions.  Turkey -- did the President dispatch the CIA director to Turkey as Turkish reports are saying right now?\nMR. SPICER:  I just saw the CIA director, so if it happened, it hasn’t happened in the last hour.\nQ    Okay.  The rest of that question was about -- this is part one -- about Gülen, whether there was discussion of extraditing Fetullah Gülen who Turkey views as a terrorist.\nMR. SPICER:  I have nothing further than the readout at this time.\nQ    The second question, though, was about your statement -- \"We don’t know when the next lone wolf is coming.\"  I believe, based on numbers, that the vast majority of lone-wolf attacks have been carried out by people who are either American, American-born, or naturalized American citizens.  So what specifically are you referring to there?  And what is he doing about those who are radicalized in front of their own computer screens?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I guess my question, Margaret -- I mean, I think there’s at least -- just for example, within the seven countries that we’ve talked about, there’s at least 20-some odd people that, over the last few years, have come into this country and been convicted of or charged with acts of terrorism.  So the --\nQ    But the people who are lone wolves and radicalized here.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  But what I’m getting at is, you don’t know, I don’t know when is the next act, who’s going to commit it, how are they going to commit it.  The point is, is that you don’t look at odds and say, hey, let’s play the odds on American lives.  You do exactly what you can to present any attack from occurring.  And so I think you can go through any system and say, when was the last time that somebody committed a shoe bomb, and so let's not take shoes off.  The TSA --\nQ    That's not what I'm asking.\nMR. SPICER:  No, I get what you're asking.  You're asking, when is the next terrorist attack, and we don’t know.\nQ    No, what is being done about people who are radicalized in the basement, in front of the computer screen, who are not affected by this ban.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  And I think the President has asked both for a plan to defeat ISIS from stuff that is coming in from this, and he's taking steps but he's also looking at working with the FBI and domestic intelligence agencies to gather the best information we can to prevent acts on our soil from people, wherever they may be.\nQ    So something more is being done on that front that we haven’t heard about?\nMR. SPICER:  He has tasked the FBI.  It is a whole-of-government approach to what's going on.  We're not looking at this myopically and just saying, these are the seven countries.  The whole point of that first executive ban* [order], and I know that's not entirely what you're asking, was to start with countries that didn’t have the appropriate vetting measures to ensure that they could come into this country.\nAs we move forward through this 90-day period, we're reviewing other countries, other options.  Those are the external threats coming into this country.  At the same time, the President has looked at options within the domestic intelligence gathering to figure out whether it's cyber or other ways that we can determine other ways to prevent or get ahead of additional threats that we might face in this country.  But it's not an either/or proposition.  It's a whole-of-government approach to what's going on.\nQ    A bipartisan group of senators are introducing legislation -- and I know you don’t like to talk about legislation -- that would allow the Senate to sign off on a reduction in sanctions against Russia.  Would the President support such a check by Congress on sanctions?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, there's two sets of sanctions, Tamara, that we got to deal with, right?  One is the ones with respect to Crimea.  And I think that Ambassador Haley has addressed that very forcefully at the U.N., that until Russia leaves Crimea, that those sanctions are a non-starter.  With respect to the other ones, I don’t want to get ahead of the legislation, if that's what that specifically is dealing with.  But again, we're not going to get into pending legislation.\nWith respect to the sanctions that specifically deal with Ukraine and Crimea, I think that Ambassador Haley has spoken very, very clearly about that.\nQ    Sean, thanks.  The President said this morning in his address to the law enforcement officials, that he'll have a zero-tolerance policy for attacks against law enforcement officers.  As a specific policy proposal, what does that mean exactly?  More death penalty cases on the federal level?  What does he mean?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that what the President said not just yesterday with his meeting with the sheriffs, but then today, is that he wants them to understand that he is a true friend -- they have a true friend in the White House, somebody who understands the dangers that they face every day by putting their lives on the line to protect the American people, whether it's pulling someone up for a traffic stop and not knowing what's in the car, or going up to a house to serve a warrant and not knowing who's behind that door.  These men and women, every day, day in and day out, are willing to put their lives on the line and make huge sacrifices.\nSo he wants them to know that they have a true friend here in the White House that's going to have their back.  How that manifests itself going forward, I think the President will have further details as that moves forward.  But for right now, I think his number-one message to them was:  You've got a friend, he's got your back, let's do what we can to get these cities.\nI think the other thing that was important is that, you know, he mentioned Chicago.  Their crime rate -- their murder rate is up 45, 50 percent.  And in so many of these cities it's up.  It's unacceptable.  And I think the President is disgusted that so many American lives are taken, injured, whatever -- that we can't walk down the streets of our own cities in safety.  And I think he wants to make sure that they understand his commitment not just to preventing acts of terrorism from coming into this country, but also that whether it's gang violence or whatever, that people feel safe and that law enforcement is empowered to do what it can to keep our community safe, to work with communities, to establish policies that both respect our citizens but do so in a way that makes them feel safe and allows them to drive and walk down the streets of our city.\nCharlie.\nQ    Journalist Matt Drudge tweeted today that the Republican Party should be sued for fraud, basically upset about the lack of any legislation to repeal Obamacare or any tax cut legislation.  So what's your message to him and anyone else who's worried about sort of the big push in the beginning and who might be concerned that that momentum is stalling?\nMR. SPICER:  I think it's hardly stalling.  I think it's a mammoth thing to repeal and replace.  I think there's no question the President's commitment to doing this.  You've heard Speaker Ryan talk about how we should be able to have this wrapped up by the end of the year.  It's a big bill.  It got jammed through, and it was very sweeping.  We're talking about one-fifth of our economy.  We can either do it quickly, as the Democrats did, and end up with a monstrosity where premiums go up, access is limited, or we can do it right.\nAnd I think the President, while he wants to get this done as soon as possible and understand what's at stake, he wants to do it right.  He understands how important health care is to American families and individuals.  And so his goal is to get it done right and have an outcome that achieves the goals that it sets out to do.  That's it -- plain and simple.\nApril.\nQ    Sean, I have a series of questions.\nMR. SPICER:  Look what you started, Hallie Jackson.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Don't blame it on Hallie, okay?   Going back to the issue of policing, what happens when there is a situation -- you're talking about good policing -- but what happens when there are situations that we've seen over the last few years that have been highlighted with this accountability piece with cameras?  What happens when there is bad policing?  What does this President --\nMR. SPICER:  Then we have to deal with it.  I don't -- I think the President wants to do what he can.  But again, I think you're right, we've got to have good policing.  But that's -- he wants to stand with them, talk about how we can do proper training, what kind of funding they need to do their job better.  In so many cases, the policy are asking for the resources because they've become fearful of making routine stops by preventing it.\nSo I think it’s working with the police, integrating those kind of back and forth and having a dialogue in communities to make sure that we're doing it, as you put it, in a way that instills confidence in our citizens and our communities.  But we can do this right.  And we can make sure --\nQ    So it’s not an either/or, though?\nMR. SPICER:  No, absolutely no.\nQ    Okay.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no.  We've got to do this -- look, police officers from around this country on a daily basis put their lives out there, and I think that they want to keep communities safe.  Like teachers, they enter this not -- no cop signs up, or sheriff, because of the money.  Like teachers, they do it because they care about the community.  They care about making this country better, their community better.  But I think, in return, they should be provided the resources and the policies they need to do their job well and to do so that ensures that we have this back-and-forth dialogue with the American people that continues to earn the respect that they deserve for the sacrifice they're making.\nQ    All right, the next question.\nMR. SPICER:  How many have we got?  Just so I --\nQ    Maybe three -- maybe three more.  (Laughter.)  It’s Black History Month.  Let me go.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  You can play that once.  (Laughter.)\nQ    I got a couple more days.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay.  (Laughter.)\nQ    All right, so listen, on the issue of last evening with Elizabeth Warren.  Coretta Scott King -- I want to get your reaction to these words that they're not allowed:  “Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge.”  And she’s basically saying that Sessions has indifference towards criminal violations of civil rights laws.  What do you say to that?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, obviously, we have a lot of respect for her and the sacrifices that she made, and the sacrifices that, frankly, she endured in her life.  But I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Session then and now.\nHis records on civil voting rights I think is outstanding.  And like Arlen Specter, the late Arlen Specter, I can only hope that if she was still with us today, that after getting to know him and to see his record and his commitment to voting civil rights, that she would share the same view that Senator Specter did where he said, “Although I voted against him, getting to know the man that is now, I regret that vote.”  And I would hope that if she was still with us today that she would share that sentiment.\nBecause Senator Sessions’s records both as U.S. attorney for Alabama, as attorney general, and as senator has been one that has stood up for voting rights.  He prosecuted the Klan.  He stood up for Coretta Scott King getting -- for getting the gold medal.  He has been a tireless advocate of voting and civil rights throughout his career.  And I would just hope that if she was still with us today, that she would share the sentiments of former Senator Specter.\nQ    Okay, and last two.  On diversity here, the administration’s diversity issues, you've been slammed on that recently.  I understand that there’s been a meeting.  Vice President Pence has been talking to J.C. Watts, Michael Steele and others -- if you can elaborate on that.  And also there’s a lot of groundswell about this HBCU executive order.  What’s going on with that?\nMR. SPICER:  So the HBCU presidents will be in town later this month as part of a national celebration.  We’ll have further updates on both the meetings that we may have with them, the activities surrounding that, in terms of the administration.  And then I think we’ll have further updates on it, as I mentioned with all executive orders.  We have nothing to update on that.\nBut obviously, the President has a strong commitment to them and understands over the last eight years they've been woefully neglected.  And I think he wants to really show a commitment in funding to HBCUs.  And so you’ll see I think not just a push this month, but in his budget and going forward.\nQ    PLUS loans, Pell grants?\nMR. SPICER:  I think his budget will address a lot of these issues, April.\nQ    The diversity piece, the diversity piece.\nMR. SPICER:  And I think -- look, we're going to continue to reach out to a lot of folks to get their ideas and their input.  I think he’s shown that both through the transition and now.  But we're going to continue to reach out to people of different backgrounds, of different color, of different gender, of different economic -- socioeconomic, of different industry, of different parties.  The President I think continues to show a desire to reach out and talk to people who I think share an agenda of moving the country forward and doesn't really care about their background, their voting history, any of those other ideological traits.  If they share a commitment to moving this country forward and lifting people up, that's his end of --\nQ    Sean --\nQ    You mentioned the \"one in, two out\" order in your opening.  There was a lawsuit filed in federal court this morning challenging that lawsuit.  Is the White House aware of that?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    And what’s your response to it?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the lawsuit presumes a lot of outcomes that are widely inaccurate.  I think that it presumes that certain things would be part of the \"one out.\"\nThe bottom line is, is that overregulation has stemmed economic growth and job creation.  Reviewing those to make sure that they are meeting their intent and not stifling job creation at the expense of whatever they were intended to do is something that should be smart and welcome by everybody.\nThe idea that we're willy-nilly just allowing regulations to occur, but the lawsuit specifically, is wildly inaccurate.  It makes a ton of assumptions that call for speculation on what may or may not happen in the future.  And that's highly -- it's just subjective at best and doesn't have any basis in fact.\nThank you, guys.  Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\nQ    More hands up here, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  I know, I'll see them tomorrow.\nEND\n2:38 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2017-02-08T00:00:00", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/8/2017, #10"}

Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:42 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Just before I came up, I wanted to let you all know that we're monitoring the severe weather that's going through Louisiana at this time.  The President is aware of the situation and is going to be reaching out to local and state officials throughout the day.\nAlso, yesterday evening, the President concurred with the FEMA Administrator's recommendation to approve Governor Bryant's request to add public assistance to the previously issued major disaster declaration in Mississippi.  Per the Governor's request, public assistance will be added for three counties -- Forrest, Lamar, and Perry.\nYesterday, the President had an amazing day at MacDill Air Force Base, where he met with leaders of both Special Operations Command and Central Command, and then had lunch with enlisted servicemembers thanking them for their service and hearing the ideas that were on their mind.\nThe President announced his intent to make historic financial investment in the armed forces of the United States, showing the entire world that America has the back of all those who stand in defense of freedom.  As he has said many times before, the armed forces are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and we must protect those who protect us.\nThe President kicked off today with a listening session of county sheriffs from around the country.  The President welcomed leaders from the National Sheriffs' Association to the White House and pledged to work closely with all members of the law enforcement community to keep the American people safe.  He assured the sheriffs that the Trump administration will make every effort to stop drugs and crime from flowing into the country, put an end to the opioid epidemic, secure the borders to keep terrorists out, and strengthen the bonds between state, local and federal law enforcement agencies.\nThe sheriffs thanked the President for what they described as his \"unprecedented\" level of support for law enforcement and offered their full backing of his border security and immigration policies.  They expressed how encouraged they have been by the pro-law enforcement atmosphere that has swept the country in the wake of the President's victory.\nThey also presented a letter on behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, thanking the President for his “recent show of support for law enforcement, specifically on immigration and border security issues” and commending the President’s two executive orders for taking “significant steps to enhancing public safety.”\nThe group engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the issues facing the law enforcement community, which the sheriffs said was an opportunity they hadn't been given under the previous administration.  The sheriffs closed the meeting by thanking the President for defending the rule of law.  And the President took them to the Oval Office to honor them and show his appreciation for their outstanding work they do to keep our communities safe.\nA list of the attendees is available for those who are interested.\nAfter that meeting, the President held another listening session on how to best fix the VA.  It's a top priority for the President and this administration to ensure that veterans get the care they need when and where they need it.  Tragically, many of our veterans are being failed by a system that does not work.  This administration will reform and modernize the VA under the leadership of Dr. Shulkin, creating a culture of accountability that puts our veterans first.\nThe President welcomed the group to the Roosevelt Room and expressed his intention to take whatever steps are necessary to improve health care access and quality for our heroic veterans. Ms. Tiffany Smiley, the wife of a veteran who was blinded by an IED, detailed her family's difficulty and experience with the VA health care system, and offered suggestions to how it could be improved.  The President, VA Secretary-designate Dr. David Shulkin, and a group of health care experts and veterans advocates, including Ike & Laura Perlmutter, engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on reforming the VA so that the needs of veterans come first.\nThe experts discussed private sector solutions and innovations that could be used to improve the VA.  The President praised the Secretary-designate for his commitment to veterans and thanked the group for their willingness to serve and do what was best for our veterans.  They plan to meet on a regular basis to discuss their collective efforts to improve the VA and its health care system.\nAlso this afternoon, the Vice President had a big day on Capitol Hill, where he cast a historic deciding vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.  The President believes strongly that our nation’s success depends on the education of our students.  And Betsy DeVos has devoted nearly three decades of her time and talent to promoting educational opportunity.  As Secretary, she will ensure that every student has access to a good school, whether it’s public, private, parochial, charter, or any other kind.\nThe fact that we had to get to the point where the Vice President had to be pulled in to overcome the Democrats’ historic and partisan logjam of the President’s qualified nominee is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that Senate Democrats have engaged in throughout this process.\nThe American people sent a strong message when they elected President Trump in November:  They're fed up with business as usual in Washington.  Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the President enacting an agenda that put him into office.\nLast week, I noted the President had a fair amount of Cabinet-level appointees awaiting a full vote by the Senate.  We’re looking forward to seeing more of the President’s picks to lead agencies and departments confirmed in the upcoming week, despite these childish tactics of the Democrats in the Senate, who would rather keep the failed status quo than allowing to put the President's people in place.\nAlso on the Hill today, Judge Gorsuch continues a full week of meetings with Republican and Democratic senators.  Yesterday, he met with Senators Tester and Feinstein.  Today he will meet with Senators Sasse, Schumer, Crapo, and Thune.  The President is looking forward to a full hearing for the judge, followed by an up or down vote on this incredibly qualified nominee.\nAt this moment, the President is meeting with Congressman Jason Chaffetz to discuss how to work together to enact his reform agenda.  Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson.  The President was obviously pleased to welcome and confirm -- swear in Secretary Tillerson in the Oval Office last week, and he's pleased that the Secretary is now able to bring his unique skillset and deep insights to the important work of the State Department.\nFollowing his discussion with Secretary Tillerson, the President will have calls with Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain and President Erdogan of Turkey.  We’ll of course have readouts of both of those calls when they're completed.\nThis evening, the President will host young officers from the United States Army Special Forces Qualification Course in the Oval Office.  As the President said yesterday, members of our military and their families are our nation’s heroes.  It is one of his top priorities to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces have the tools, equipment, and resources they need to execute their mission successfully.  The President is looking forward to conveying his gratitude and support to these young brave captains.\nLater this evening, around 6:00, 9th Circuit Court will hold oral arguments, per its order from yesterday.  I want to quickly run down what we can expect to happen tonight.  A career attorney from the Department of Justice will present an argument in defense of the President’s order.  And to be clear, all that’s at issue tonight is the hearing -- is an interim decision on whether the President’s order is enforced or not until the case is heard on the actual merits of the order.  It’s a simple status quo versus anti-status quo decision.\nThis is just like the case in Boston, which started as a temporary restraining order.  There, once we were able to explain our position, the court lifted the order and held that the President’s executive order could take effect.  As I have stated before, 8 U.S. Code 1182 gives the President constitutional authority for this executive order.  It says, “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions which he may deem to be appropriate.\"  We look forward to a final decision on the merits of this soon.\nLooking ahead, I know a few have been asking for more details on Prime Minister Abe’s visit later this week.  As previously announced, he will visit the White House for meetings on the 10th of February.  The President has also invited him down to Mar-a-Lago, and the two leaders will travel there for the weekend.  This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance, and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan.\nNeedless to say, the President is looking very much forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House to celebrate their fifth World Championship.  It was obviously a spectacular game.\nLastly, we have our eyes on Kabul today following the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least 19 Afghan civilians and wounded 14 [41].  Just this morning, General Flynn spoke with the Afghan National Security Advisor to reaffirm our continued support for Afghanistan and for our Strategic Partnership.  We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms, and we commend the Afghan security forces for their rapid response.  We also reaffirm our support to the Afghan government as they work to defend their people against enemies of peace.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.  David Jackson.\nQ    Sean, the list of 78 terrorist attacks that you released, it looked like it had been prepared well in advance.  I mean, was that already on hand when President Trump made his comments?  Or did you do it afterwards and plan to release it?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the answer was, we had been getting questions as to what the President's remarks were.  We wanted to be very clear that there are a lot of examples between 2014 and 2016 that have occurred, and many of them haven’t gotten the attention that they have deserved.  It’s becoming too often that we’re seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve.  And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country.\nThe reason the President has been acting in so many of the ways that he has with executive order and otherwise, the discussions that he had down at CENTCOM and SOCOM yesterday, are because he cares about making sure that we don’t have attacks in this country, that we’re protected, that we’re ahead of the curve.  And I think what we need to do is to remind people that the Earth is a very dangerous place these days, that ISIS is trying to do us harm, and that the President’s commitment is to keep this country safe.\nAnd I think part of this is to make sure that the American people are reminded how prevalent some of these attacks and how much time and attention they have or have not gotten, but, more importantly, to make sure that they understand the unwavering commitment that the President has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe.\nQ    Was the list put together after his comments?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.  Yes.\nTrey.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  On the call with Turkish President Erdogan later today, does President Trump intend to discuss plans for Syrian safe zones?  And does the President expect Turkey to help create those zones?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we’ll have a readout for you on that.  I don’t want to get ahead of the two leaders’ calls.\nAlexis, RealClearPolitics.\nQ    Sean, I have two questions for you.  You were mentioning that voters are going to remember how senators voted on the President’s Cabinet nominees.  Two Republicans voted against Betsy DeVos -- Senators Collins and Murkowski.  Did the President reach out to either of them?  And will he not forget what Republicans did in that particular nominee situation?\nMR. SPICER:  I think -- look, the President has been very clear it’s not Republicans that have stood in the way of this nomination of all of these qualified individuals.  It’s been Democrats that have stalled over and over again, not attending hearings, trying to use every delay tactic possible.  It’s those people that have a problem, and I think that’s the message that the party has missed on the Democratic side, which -- and I don’t think that -- I wouldn’t paint it with a broad brush, because I think it’s Senate Democrats, frankly, that haven’t gotten the message.\nQ    But he never reached out to them?\nMR. SPICER:  Our team has been in contact with the entire Senate team to make sure that they understand and that they’ve had visits as requested.  But we have been in constant contact with the Senate, members of the Senate, their staffs.  Our legislative affairs team has had an extremely robust schedule of meetings with their teams to make these nominees available to them.\nBut I think the broader issue, again -- and with all due respect, I think it’s interesting that we’re focusing on the votes of two Republicans when you look at the spectrum of antics that have gone on in the Democrats.  I mean, the tactics that they have done over and over and over again to delay, not show up to hearings, filibuster to the extent that they can, run the clock out -- it’s not Republicans that have a problem here, Alexis.  It’s the Democrats that continue to do this.\nQ    The second question has to do with the President’s remarks about the Affordable Care Act in his interview on Sunday -- because he indicated in his response, in that interview, that he thought that the repeal-and-replace was going to take longer, perhaps into 2018.  Can you clarify whether he is frustrated about this, what he is doing about the timing?  Because, of course, voters who sent him here were anticipating that this might move faster than he was conveying in the interview.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think luckily -- and you saw Speaker Ryan’s comments earlier today -- I think we can have this done legislatively sooner rather than later, but I think the implementation of a lot of the pieces may take a little bit longer.\nIt’s a big, big bill that the Democrats passed.  As you recall, they told us we could read it after they passed it.  We are now going through this to make sure that we do this in a very responsible way, to make sure that health care, which is so vital to so many Americans and their families, is preserved while we put a new system in place that both lowers costs and increases accessibility.\nBut the President, I think, is very encouraged by the commitment and work that’s going on on the Hill to make sure that we get this thing replaced as quick as possible.\nFred Lucas.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  I wanted to ask -- actually, a follow-up related to that.  Speaker Ryan has actually said -- and I'm quoting -- with Obamacare you can’t “tinker at the margins and repair it.  You can't.  It is a collapsing law.\"  Do you agree with that?  And you can’t build on what’s already there, you have to get rid of the entire law?\nMR. SPICER:  I think what we’re focused on is the end solution.  And I think we’ve been very clear over and over again that the President is going to repeal and replace it, and that what Americans will get at the end of this is a health care solution that, as I’ve said before over and over again, is going to give them a lower-cost health solution with more options.  That’s what they were promised in the first place.  That’s what we can give.\nAnd I think the President, being able to approach this in the businesslike manner that he’s done so successfully in the past, is going to ensure that he negotiates prices, that we look at those business-like practices, force competition among states and other things that will help lower cost once and for all, and provide that competition.\nQ    On Iran sanctions, does the President have any concerns about the fact that Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary in terms of implementing those sanctions?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  We implemented them -- they went off without a hitch.\nFred -- I mean, John Decker.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  As you know, the President spoke over the weekend on Twitter and criticized the federal judge appointed by George W. Bush who imposed the nationwide restraining order.  He called him a \"so-called judge.\"  Is the President, as it relates to the arguments -- I know you're confident -- but the arguments that will be presented this evening -- is he prepared to accept an adverse ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals?\nMR. SPICER:  There's no question the President respects the judicial branch and its ruling, but I think that there's no way -- I just read off the U.S. code on that.  I don't think there's any other way that you can interpret that, that the President has the discretion to do what's necessary to keep this country safe.  And I think that's his concern, frankly, right now, is that when the law is such as it is, that anyone could interpret that any other way.  I think he feels confident, just like in the ruling in Boston, that we're going to prevail on this on the merits of the case because it is done so in a very lawful way.\nKatherine.\nQ    Will the administration take a position on the Israeli legislation to retract or illegalize the thousands of West Bank settlements?  Last week, obviously, you said building the settlements may not be helpful.\nMR. SPICER:  I think that, as I mentioned last week -- and I don't want to get too far ahead of this -- but Prime Minister Netanyahu will be here on the 15th.  I think that will be obviously a topic of discussion right now.  I don't want to get ahead of that.\nCharlie Spiering.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Just a quick question.  Any response to the calls for impeachment by Representative Maxine Waters?\nMR. SPICER:  No.\nHunter Walker.\nI mean, I would just say, look, I think, look, it is -- the President is doing everything he can to move this country forward.  And I think whether it's the Democrats in the Senate who are trying to stall these nominees or these little political stunts on the House side, the bottom line is, I think by and large you see the support that the President is receiving for his policies throughout the country.  And it's because I think people recognize, A, that business as usual is over and that the President's commitment to both keeping this country safe, growing the economy and creating jobs is something that is welcomed by all Americans, regardless of party.\nI think when you see stuff like that, I think it really just shows that they really missed the message that voters sent this past November.\nHunter Walker.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  CNN reportedly declined to interview Kellyanne Conway on Sunday because of the questions about her credibility.  Is the White House willing to offer alternative representatives to networks that refuse to work with specific spokespeople?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, frankly, I think that my understanding is they retracted that, they walked that back or denied it, however you want to put it -- I don't care.  But I think Kellyanne is a very trusted aide of the President.  I think for any characterization otherwise is insulting.\nI don't think -- if they choose not to work with someone, that's up to them.  But I think we're going to continue to put out key leaders of this administration, including Kellyanne, that can articulate the President's policies and agenda.\nKatie Pavlich.\nQ    Thanks, Sean, for the question.  Is President Trump planning to ask the Senate to expedite legislation allowing for the swift firing of bad VA employees?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President's commitment, as you heard both during the campaign and as he's talked to Dr. Shulkin, is to make sure that we're providing the best care.  And if there's things that are an impediment to that care being offered up or reformed, then he is going to make sure that we enact policies internally that make sure that people who are not doing their job, not servicing veterans, we can figure out how to expedite that process.\nBut the idea that we're sitting around having a discussion about personnel inhibiting the care that veterans deserve really does not bode well for the reflection that we want on this country.  I mean, people who have served this nation -- we should be bending over backwards to make sure that the benefits and the care and the services that they, frankly, earned is something that is given the highest priority and is something that the President remains highly committed to.\nMiriam Borgess.\nQ    Hey, hi.  The President is going to speak later today with the Spanish leader, Mariano Rajoy.  And I would like to know how President Trump sees the relation with Spain, and which are the main issues they are going to discuss in their phone call.\nMR. SPICER:  So I'm not going to -- we'll have a readout after the call, but I imagine that they're going to talk about a shared commitment to defeating ISIS and that they'll discuss our bilateral relationship and reaffirm our commitment to the two countries.  I think we will have a readout on that call with Spain as we will with all the countries and all the other leaders that we will talk to and we have in the past.  So I don't want to get too far ahead of it, but I would imagine that the current relationship that we have with Spain and our commitment to ISIS will be at the forefront of that.\nMaria Peña.\nQ    Yes, here, sorry.  Thank you.  It's kind of loud in here.  So it's a two-part question.  One, can you confirm whether or not the White House has accepted the credentials of the new Mexican ambassador, Gerónimo Gutiérrez?  And also Representative Mike Rogers, I believe, this morning said that he plans to introduce a bill to impose a 2 percent tax on all remittances that Mexicans send to their country to pay for the wall.  Would the President rally behind that bill?\nMR. SPICER:  So, first, I would have to get back to you on the ambassador’s credentials.  I don't know.  We could check with the Department of State and figure that out.  I don't know that right off the top of my head.\nAnd I’m not going to comment -- I don't -- we don't put out statements of administration policy until the bill has gone through the process.\nHallie.\nQ    Two questions for you.  One, following up on health care, the President, as you know, campaigned for 18 months on replacing the Affordable Care Act.  Where is his plan?\nMR. SPICER:  He’s working with Congress.  I just answered that question.  But he’s working with Speaker Ryan.  Let me -- you're acting like --\nQ    The specifics of it, though.  I mean, does he owe the American people something now given --\nMR. SPICER:  And I think he’s been very clear that he owes the American people a result that's going to lower costs and provide more access.  That's what he continues to work with Speaker Ryan on.  I think the Speaker was very clear on it -- that they're having meetings both legislatively and at the principal level to make sure that this gets done.\nAnd I think as you heard Speaker Ryan, we continue to be optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year.  It’s a mammoth bill what they passed and did it -- and I think we've got to make sure that we do this right.  We don't want to end up with the same result that Democrats did.  They rushed it through.  No one was able to read the bill.  And premiums have skyrocketed; access and options have gone down.  We need to make sure that we don't do this in a way that's going to end up with the same result.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ    I have a question for you, Sean, though, on Yemen.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    I did say two.\nQ    One of the world’s most wanted terrorists is now taunting President Trump, calling him a “fool” after that raid.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    Any response from the White House?  And do you still stand by your characterization that it was a successful raid?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  That -- he was not -- that was -- the raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid.  That's what it was.  It was highly successful.  It achieved the purpose it was going to get -- save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred.  The goal --\nQ    So you're pushing back on reporting that he was a target?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  He was not -- the goal of the raid was intelligence-gathering.  And that's what we received, and that's what we got.  That's why we can deem it a success.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ    If -- and I know that you believe that you have a good case on the merits to lift the temporary restraining order.  If the President does not prevail at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, will he take this to the Supreme Court?\nMR. SPICER:  Let’s see where we go.  I think he made it very clear that --\nQ    Can I just finish?\nMR. SPICER:  Yes, you can.  I’m sorry.\nQ    And is he concerned that if this does go to the Supreme Court with its current 4-4 makeup, that this temporary restraining order might become a little more permanent?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, remember tonight is about just a restraining order.  We're not --\nQ    I know what it's about.  That's not the question.\nMR. SPICER:  Right, I understand.  But I think that it’s important to explain this to everyone, John, because I know you get it and so many others -- but I just want to make sure.  Tonight is about the restraining order.  It has nothing to do with the merits of the case.  And that's why I think we feel confident.  The question is:  Does the restraining order get lifted or not?  But regardless of what happens tonight, the merits of the case still need to be -- to discuss.\nAnd I think the merits of the case, as they were in Boston, are ones that we feel very confident on because the law is crystal clear on this.  The President has the authority to do this.  It was done so in an interagency process that ensured that all the appropriate people were consulted.  We went through that with flying colors.  I have zero concern that at the end of the day, we’ll be fine.  It’s just a question of going through the process.\nQ    And I get all that, as you pointed it out.  But if he does not prevail at the 9th Circuit, will he take this case to the Supreme Court?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not going to get -- let’s see where it goes first.  I think our goal right now is to get to a point we can argue it on the merits.  We feel confident, based on how the Court has reacted in Massachusetts, that we're going to be good on the merits.\nJonathan Swan.\nQ    Thanks for the question.  Does President Trump still plan to immediately terminate President Obama’s executive amnesties?\nMR. SPICER:  With respect to what, DACA and DAPA?\nQ    DAPA.\nMR. SPICER:  I’ve said this before, we’ll have further updates on that.  Go ahead.\nQ    But just in the thing, it said \"immediately terminate.\"\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.\nQ    So I just wondered what the delay is.\nMR. SPICER:  And I’ve made it -- and I’ve said before the President will have further updates on both DACA and DAPA very shortly.  We've been very clear on immigration -- what the President’s priorities would be.  As you heard Secretary Kelly testify in front of Congress today, there is going to be continued progress on the wall and on immigration as a whole.  So we're going to have plenty of time to address this.\nRight now, he’s trying to do it in a very systematic way in accordance to where we find the biggest problems.  And so he’s been very clear in the past that those who are in this country that pose a threat to us or with a criminal record are where his priorities are going to be first and foremost, and we’re going to move through the rest of folks that are in this country illegally.\nSarah.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Back to Iran.  The Ayatollah Khamenei said today that Trump has “helped Iran reveal the true face of America.”  He said Iran doesn’t fear Trump, and he encouraged Iranians to march in the street against America later this week.  Does the President have a response to those very aggressive comments?  And does he plan to take additional action against Iran if its leaders continue to escalate tensions?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President -- or the Ayatollah is going to realize that there is a new President in office.  This President is not going to sit by and let Iran flout its violations, or its apparent violations to the joint agreement.\nBut he will continue to take action as he sees fit.  The President has also made clear time and time again that he’s not going to project what those actions will be, and he will not take anything off the table.  But I think Iran is kidding itself if they don’t realize that there is a new President in town.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  On Thursday, weather permitting, the President is going to meet with airline executives from throughout the country.  Two complaints from airline executives, as well as the Pilots Association, have been, one, that Norwegian Airlines got a special advantage, a foreign carrier permit from the Obama administration, and also that the airlines of the Arab Emirates are state-subsidized, and both cases are violations of the Blue Skies Act between the U.S. and the EU.  Is this something he’s going to address?  And is he considering upending President Obama’s foreign carrier permit?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, that will be something that -- that will be decided when they meet, what they’ll talk about.  Obviously, the President is going to want to talk about economic growth and job creation, how he’s enacting orders to make sure the country is safe.\nOn the case of Norwegian, my understanding, if I’m correct, that there is a deal in which they’re having 50 percent of the crews and the pilots are American-based.  They’re flying Boeing planes.  There is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now.  I don’t want to get ahead of the President on that.  But just to be clear, I mean, when you’re talking about U.S. jobs, both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person who’s building those planes.  That’s a very big difference.\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  A few minutes ago you said that the President wanted to remind the American people of how prevalent terrorist attacks are and that the Earth is a dangerous place.  That kind of breaks with the rhetoric we’ve seen bipartisan administrations use when it comes to terrorist attacks, encouraging the American people to go about their daily lives.\nMR. SPICER:  That's not the point that -- no, no, no, --\nQ    Does this President have a different message to the American people?\nMR. SPICER:  I think, yeah, his message to the American people is that he is fully committed to doing everything that he can to keep the country safe.  And I think that there’s a big difference between what you’re saying and the point that he was making yesterday.  And I think that what he’s getting at is making -- he was making a point as to the exposure that attacks get.  And I think that’s what he was getting at, is that we see these things and they’re becoming too prevalent.\nAnd that’s why I think he wants to become ever vigilant to make sure that we don’t ever get lax, that we need to be reminded that places and groups like ISIS continue to seek to do us harm, and that it is his job as Commander-in-Chief to do everything he can to get ahead of the curve and keep this country safe.\nI think when you look at the poll that came out last week -- and I think it was 67 percent of the American people agree with his proposition to put further restrictions on people, to make sure that we have countries who are sending people to our country that they are coming here for peaceful purposes, and that if we can’t guarantee those countries have the proper vetting and systems in place when they are outbound to the United States, then we need to do what we can, and he will do what he has to as President, to make sure that this country is safe.\nSo I think there is a -- the point that he was making was not to put fear in anybody, but to, rather, reassure them that as President of the United States he is taking every single step to do what he has to to get ahead of the threats, to get ahead of the concerns so we’re not looking in the rearview mirror thinking, what should we have done, what could we have done; that we’re preventing lives -- whether it’s the raid in Yemen, the law that he’s enacting -- that he’s going to do what he can to make sure that this homeland and our people are protected and safe.\nMara.\nQ    Thank you.  I just have two questions.  One on a tweet and one on health care.  When the President tweeted, “If something happens, blame the judge and the court system,” did he mean if a terrorist attack is committed by somebody from these seven countries?  Or any terrorist attack should be blamed on the judge and the court system?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the point that he -- the tweet is pretty clear.  But I think his point is, is that -- kind of dovetails what I was just saying to Zeke -- he’s doing everything he can.  And he walks into office -- there are seven countries that the Obama administration has already identified as not having the proper systems in place to guarantee our safety -- and I think his immediate reaction is to do what he has to do to make sure that we’re not looking back and saying, you know what we should have done, we should have made sure that we had stricter vetting in place for those seven countries.\nSo he took immediate and decisive action to make sure that this country and our people were protected.  That’s what he’s talking about, is making sure that we don’t have regret, that a month from now or two months from now or a year from now we hadn’t done something to protect people.  And so he acted as quick and decisively as possible to make sure that we put the systems in place to protect our people.  And I don’t think there’s any other way to read that.\nQ    A question on health care.  Can I just get my second question?\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.\nQ    You just said he’ll negotiate prices, and that’s something he -- he ran on negotiating prices for Medicare, drug prices.  And I just want you to clarify where he is on that, because when he met with big pharma the other day, before the meeting he said, we have no choice, we have to get prices down.  After the meeting he said he would oppose anything that makes it harder for these companies to bring their drugs to market, including price fixing by Medicare.  So is he for Medicare negotiating drug prices, or not?\nMR. SPICER:  He’s for it, yes.  He wants to make sure --\nQ    He’s still for it.\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.\nQ    Okay.\nMR. SPICER:  The President is clear -- I mean, when you look at the costs of -- not just drug costs.  The U.S. government has not done -- I mean, you look at what -- frankly, the easier way to look at this is what other countries have done -- negotiating costs to keep those down.  As drug prices continue to escalate, that drives up health care costs for every American.  But particularly, there’s a huge burden on America’s seniors who are so much more reliant on drug prices.  And in many cases you have people living on a fix income.  And health care costs -- rising health care costs and prescription drugs continue to be a burden on their ability to live out their lives in a much more enjoyable manner.\nAnd so his commitment is to make sure that he does what he can, and I think rather successfully uses his skills as a businessman to drive them down.\nMargaret.\nQ    Sean, can you clarify two things?\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    One, Secretary Kerry -- Kelly, excuse me, when he was on the Hill today said that the administration right now is not looking at adding other countries to this temporary travel ban list.  Is the White House still giving itself room to add some countries to that list?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think what his point was is, is that right now, he’s not doing it.  You have to look at his testimony in context.  I think he went through the fact that we’re still in this review process, that he is committed to making sure that we look at all other countries.  But as of this moment, there is no immediate desire to add to that, but he is looking at all of the other countries, the procedures that we have with them, the systems we have in place to check them.  And so nothing is final until the end of the review period.\nQ    But I had a second question, sorry.  So you said still leaving room to do that.  Something that the President continues to say as a phrase -- and I’m hoping you can define it for us -- is that this is about testing who truly loves America and making sure that those who enter the country are those who truly love America.  How do you quantify that?  What is the President thinking of?  Is that a specific test?  What does that mean?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I mean -- look, I think there’s a -- I think the President’s goal is to make sure that people aren’t coming here to do us harm; that they're going through the proper extreme vetting in cases where we don't have the information required to make a good judgment on them based on what their country is willing to provide; that we are taking the proper and necessary steps to protect our people.\nBut he doesn't -- if someone is coming here to do us harm or to espouse things that would give us a good indication that they're not coming here for the right reasons, then we need to do everything we can to, A, vet them and, B, unless we're 100 percent certain, keep them out of the country.\nQ    It's a background check.\nMR. SPICER:  It's a background check.  But again, I wouldn't just -- it's not.  I mean, it is -- to the extent that we can, it's going to be extreme vetting is what he's talked about; that it's not going to be just letting someone in on a quick check.  If there's any cause for concern, he wants to go to every step possible to make sure that people who are entering this country are doing so because they want to come here for the right reasons and for peaceful reasons.\nYeah.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  On South Korea, South Korea knows about Trump is very good friend of theirs.  And the (inaudible) most important part of his policy on South Korea?\nMR. SPICER:  What will what, please?\nQ    What was most important part of Trump's policy towards South Korea?\nQ    The most important part of the policy --\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Look, he had a conversation the other day and we look forward to filling that conversation.  I think obviously the threat of North Korea is the most prominent issue that faces South Korea in our alliance right now.  He wants to reassure the South Korean government, the Blue House, that we are going to do what we can to make sure that we stand with South Korea and that we prevent any further hostile actions from North Korea.\nSo I think that the safety of our country, of South Korea, of the region are going to be clearly the greatest focus of this.\nQ    John-Christopher, Talk-Media News.  When the President submits his budget, is he committed to pushing Congress to approve sufficient funding for all American students to have either an outstanding public school education or the public funding for them to reach an outstanding private school education?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President has talked extensively about education during the primary, whether it's an Associate's Degree, a Bachelor's Degree, a PhD or vo-technical education that we've got to give students these days the options they need for the workforce; that a vo-tech education in some cases is what's in the interest of students in terms of their success, and giving them the skills to work on cars or become a computer engineer or whatever.\nBut as we head into -- as we look towards the future, we've got to make sure that we're preparing our students to have the skillset that they need.  And it's also the retraining aspect of that -- that as people get older and certain industries start to turn the corner because of technology, that we're allowing people the opportunity for retraining to give them the skillset that they need to reenter the workforce and continue to be productive.\nSo I think as you will see -- look, we literally will swear in the Secretary of Education hopefully later this evening, which we will let you all know -- probably around the 5:00 or 6:00 hour.  But that will be something that he's going to continue to have a conversation with Secretary DeVos about.  Something that she's made clear -- and it's unfortunate that we haven't been able to have this conversation sooner because it was held up for so long -- but I think that's something that Secretary DeVos will be speaking a lot about, about the education funding and skillset and opportunities that we give not just our children but people older in life who are looking to get back into the workforce through another avenue.\nQ    How about the K-12?  How about the youngsters?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we'll have plenty of time to discuss the President's budget as we get closer -- as he sort of develops that.  Today, we're excited that Secretary DeVos will get sworn in.\nThanks a lot, guys.  Have a great one.  Take care.\nEND\n2:19 P.M.

EST\nMR. SPICER:  Hi guys, how are you?  Hope you had a great day.  I want to start off by congratulating the five-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.  It was a great day for football last night.  And the President looks forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House later this year.\nAs you know, during the weekend, the President spoke to four world leaders.  On Saturday, he spoke with Italian Prime Minister Gentiloni, during which they discussed strengthening cooperation around a large range of shared interests.  The President also agreed to attend the G7 meeting in May, where he looks forward to meeting with the Prime Minister on the sidelines.\nAlso on Saturday, the President spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko, addressing a variety of topics, including Ukraine’s long-running conflict with Russia.  They also discussed plans for an in-person meeting in the future.\nOn Sunday, the President had a call with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, where he reiterated the United States’ interest in (inaudible) NATO.  The two leaders agreed to continue close coordination and cooperation to discuss the full range of security issues facing NATO and its member countries.\nFollowing that call, the President spoke with New Zealand Prime Minister English, affirming the close relationship between the two countries and our appreciation for New Zealand’s significant contributions to international peace.\nYou guys, as you saw this afternoon, the President had an opportunity to visit with leaders of both SOCOM and CENTCOM to get an update on the issues facing our military and the hotspots around the world, the challenges we face, and the actions that our brave men and women around the globe are taking to help keep this country safe.  The President obviously had a chance to sit down with enlisted members of our military after that, and hear from them their concerns and issues, and, most importantly, thank them for their service to our nation.\nTomorrow, we have a delegation that is heading out to attend the inauguration of the Haitian President in Port-au-Prince.  The State Department's Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, will lead the delegation, which includes representatives from both the State Department and the White House.\nThe President is also looking forward to welcoming the Prime Minister of Japan this Friday, and we’ll have further guidance on that visit this weekend.\nWith that, I’ll take a few questions.  Steve.\nQ    Can you give us an example of a terrorist attack anywhere that the news media has not reported on?\nMR. SPICER:  We’ll provide a list later.  There’s several instances.  And the President, again, got a great update today on the fight against ISIS that’s going on throughout the region and what our military is facing throughout this globe, trying to combat ISIS.  But there’s a lot of instances that have occurred where I don’t think that they’ve gotten the coverage it's deserved, and I think that’s what the President was clearly referring to there.\nSteve.\nQ    Are you rethinking your strategy toward this executive order?  What’s your next step in pushing this ahead?\nMR. SPICER:  We’re not rethinking the strategy at all.  I think the court has asked both parties to present their cases.  Remember, what we’re discussing right now has nothing to do with the merits of the order.  The law is very clear on this, that the President has huge discretion to protect the safety of the American people and our nation’s institutions with respect to who can come into this country.  This is just purely on the injunction that the judge issued, and I think that we’re going to make that case tonight -- or he’s got -- both sides have put forward their rulings.\nBut again, when you look at the case in Massachusetts -- or the judge in Massachusetts, clearly the law is on the President’s side.  The Constitution is on the President’s side.  He has broad discretion to do what’s in the nation’s best interests to protect our people.  And we feel very confident that we will prevail in this matter.\nQ    But you're not thinking about withdrawing the executive order or rewriting it?\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no.  This law -- this executive order was done in the best interest of protecting the American people.  And I think this is something that has broad support from the American people from one coast to another, and we're going to continue to do what we have to.  And this President is committed to making sure that the country and its people are safe.\nQ    Sean, the President over the weekend said that he believed that jihadis were now pouring into the country.  Is there any evidence to suggest that that's true?  Is that what intelligence is telling him?\nMR. SPICER:  I think part of the reason he issued the order the way he did was to ensure that people didn't have an advance notice, and he protected the country and ensured that we have an idea of who's coming in and out of the country.\nQ    Is anybody coming in?\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not going to get into specific information that the President has.  Needless to say, again, that his number-one priority is to do what he can to keep the American people safe.\nQ    John Yoo, who was obviously a major figure in the Bush administration, who spoke about -- was a big proponent of executive authority, today wrote in The New York Times about his concerns about the way that the new administration is taking action.  What do you say to him?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think if you look at Secretary Kelly’s comments from last week, this was an action that was fully coordinated through departments to make sure that everyone understood what we're going to do, to make sure it was compliant, and that it was in the best interest of keeping America safe.\nMr. Yoo has obviously spent some time in the Justice Department, and I think he should understand better than anybody that we did -- we took all the necessary steps and did it in a way that protected country.\nQ    You said -- just to be clear -- before you said that, you're going to follow up later with the unreported terrorist -- were they unreported or under-reported?\nMR. SPICER:  Under-reported.\nQ    And what are the reasons?  The President said that we all know what the reasons are.\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President’s comments were very clear at the time.  He felt as though members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage.\nHe’s doing what he can to protect this nation and protect our people.  And that's why I think sometimes the polls don't reflect what you see on the media.  You see a wide degree of support for the President’s policies to protect this country, to create jobs, to grow the economy, and yet a lot of those stories and successes that he’s had in a mere two and a half weeks in office aren’t exactly covered to the degree to which they should be.\nQ    So he thinks that these terror attacks are under-reported to make him look bad?\nMR. SPICER:  No, that's not what he said at all.  I think his statement was very clear on that.\nYes.\nQ    Do you have a plan to reinstate extreme vetting?\nMR. SPICER:  What?\nQ    Extreme vetting of refugees, do you have -- is there a plan to reinstate it?\nMR. SPICER:  Reinstate it?\nQ    Reinstate, yes.  After the ban has been overturned.\nMR. SPICER:  Once we win the case, it will go right back into action.  We're complying with the court.  Once we prevail, it will go right back into action.\nAnd again, part of that plan was a 90-day and 100-day plan respectively with respect to refugees and then people coming in to make sure that we took the steps and developed a further plan to protect the country.  Whether we add people or go more stringently in other aspects is up to part of what is determined during that period.\nQ    Sean, can you elaborate a little bit on what the President said to Bill O’Reilly about the irregular voter registration list and what Vice President Pence is going to be doing on that?\nMR. SPICER:  I think he’s very clear that he is going to -- he has named Vice President Pence to lead a task force that will look into this.  But obviously when you see so many people that have registered in two states, that that presents a problem.  There are people that have registered in two have died and been still on the rolls.  I think we need to look into this to make sure that we're protecting the integrity of the vote; that one person's vote should count the same as the next.  And any attempt to undermine that really undermines anyone else's vote right now, and that's the problem -- is that we need to make sure that when somebody votes, that we have the highest degree of integrity of that counting.\nQ    Hey, Sean, when the President tweeted this morning -- \"I call my own shots\" -- was he referring to Steve Bannon's role in the White House or his TIME magazine cover?  What was he referring to?\nMR. SPICER:  It was nothing specific.  But I think the President -- there's been a lot of attempts to discuss how this works.  The President, from day one, back through the campaign and, frankly, his time as a successful businessman, always called the shots.  He's the decider.  He's the one who develops the policy.  He's the one who makes the decisions.  And I think that there are so many times when you see things that don't recognize that he is the guy that calls those shots.  He develops the policies, he implements the policies, he makes the key decisions.\nQ    Just to follow up on that, The New York Times said this morning that you're rethinking your strategy of how swiftly to roll out initiatives.  Are you going to slow things down?\nMR. SPICER:  I would say that that story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the President an apology for the way that that thing was -- there were just literally blatant factual errors.  And it's unacceptable to see that kind of reporting, or so-called reporting.  That is literally the epitome of fake news.\nQ    What part of the story was the --\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, you start at the top -- I don't think the President owns a bathrobe, or definitely doesn't wear one.  There was no meetings in conference -- I mean, it's just -- from top to bottom, it made up stories that just don't exist.  And I think that's unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news because it is just not an accurate portrayal of what's really happening.\nQ    Was the claim about whether he was briefed on the order -- the makeup of the NSC?\nMR. SPICER:  What's that?\nQ    The story talked about how the President was disappointed that he hadn't been adequately briefed on Bannon taking --\nMR. SPICER:  The President is briefed on all aspects of --\nQ    So could you just address that specifically?  What was he told and who briefed him on it?\nMR. SPICER:  I'm not going to get into detail, but I would say that the President is clearly aware of the policies that come out of the White House with his name on it.  That is what I was getting at earlier to Steve.  The President -- when it comes to decisions and policy, it's the President who leads, the President who tells us how to implement it.\nThank you guys very much.  Enjoy the landing.\nEND\n4:10 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:37 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Happy Friday.  It's another busy day here at the White House and across the Trump administration.\nThe first jobs report under the President's administration was released this morning.  It's National Wear Red Day, highlighting the importance of preventing heart disease.  It's National Catholic Schools Week.  And the President is going to be signing some executive orders, delivering some much-needed regulatory relief to lenders and borrowers in the next few minutes.\nWe're finishing up the second week here really strong.  Yesterday, another great deal was reached with Lockheed Martin for the purchase of a new lot of F35s.  Through the President’s intervention, a total of 90 planes -- for a lot of 90 planes; 55 were purchased for U.S. military that added up to a total of $455 million savings for U.S. taxpayers from the previous lot, with an average cost reduction of 7.5 percent, another big win that the President has delivered on for U.S. taxpayers.\nSpeaking of good numbers, let’s turn to the jobs report.  The economy added more than 227,000 new jobs, significantly more than the 175,000 that had been expected.  Today’s report reflects the consumer confidence that the Trump presidency has inspired.  According to a recent Gallup poll, economic confidence is at a new high, and ADP showed strong private sector hiring.  President Trump campaigned on how to make America work again.  Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise.  The President has already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and he’s looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one.\nWhile the President is definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that there’s a lot more work to be done.  The President has a big and bold agenda to grow the U.S. economy and to create jobs.  In just his first two weeks in office, he’s met with more than 50 business leaders across a vast range of industries.  This morning, the President participated in a strategic and policy forum with business leaders from some of our country’s most successful companies.  The President understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders on how to make the nation’s economy stronger.  His firsthand experience as a successful businessman helps to guide his decisions as President, and he will continue to seek opinions of other job creators while crafting an economic agenda.\nAll of these meetings are focused on one primary goal: providing new and improved employment opportunities for all Americans.  We’re looking at a full range of policy measures to achieve that goal: regulatory relief, tax and trade reform, empowering women in the workplace, rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, and improving our education system.\nAlso today, in pursuit of that goal, the President will be signing two executive actions as part of his plan to overhaul our financial and regulatory system.  I expect that to happen closer to the one o'clock hour.  The first is an executive order for posing guideline principles that sets the table for a regulatory system that mitigates risk, encourages growth, and more importantly, protects consumers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is a disastrous policy that’s hindering our markets, reducing the availability of credit, and crippling our economy’s ability to grow and create jobs.  It imposed hundreds of new regulations on financial institutions while establishing unaccountable and unconstitutional new agency that does not adequately protect consumers.  Perhaps worst of all, despite all of its overreaching, Dodd-Frank did not address the causes of the financial crisis, something we all know must be done.  It did not solve the \"too big to fail,\" and we must determine conclusively that the failure of a large bank will never again leave taxpayers on the hook.\nThe presidential memorandum addresses the burdens of government regulations and the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule.  The rule is a solution in search of a problem.  There are better ways to protect investors, and the Trump administration is taking action to do so.  We’re directing the Department of Labor to review this rule.  The rule’s intent may be to have provided retirees and others with better financial advice, but in reality, its effect has been to limit the financial services that are available to them.\nPresident Trump does not intend to put unnecessary limits on economic opportunity.  The Department of Labor exceeded its authority with this rule, and this is exactly the kind of government regulatory overreach the President was put into office to stop.  We desperately need to overhaul how we approach financial regulation.  The President is taking action to protect American taxpayers and get people back to work.\nMoving on, we announced earlier this week that we would be taking steps to address Iran’s recent actions.  Today, the U.S. sanctioned 25 individuals and entities that provide support to Iran’s ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Quds Force.  These designations are in response to Iran’s ongoing ballistic missile program, including its ballistic missile test on January 29, 2017, as well as Iran’s continued support for terrorism.  We’ve taken these actions today, after careful consideration, and will continue to respond with appropriate action.\nThese designations mark yet another stop in our continued effort to aggressively target Iran’s ballistic missile program and terrorism-related activities.  Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Mattis is on the final day of a two-day trip through Asia.  He visited Korea yesterday and Japan today, returning to Washington tomorrow.  Secretary Mattis’s visit emphasizes the priority President Trump places on the Asia-Pacific, and on strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance in the face of a growing North Korea nuclear and ballistic missile threat.\nOver in the Senate, the President now has 11 Cabinet nominees awaiting a full Senate vote on their confirmations.  We look forward to welcoming these individuals into the administration.\nRegarding the weekend’s plans, the President will debut his second weekly Facebook Live event this evening at 5 o’clock.  You can expect him to recap another week of action on behalf of the American people.  He’ll also comment on his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  And while recognizing Black History Month, he will discuss his vision to deliver more opportunity and safety for the African-American community.\nOne more note of this week’s address:  the lead-in to the President’s remark on Facebook Live will feature some of the incredible artwork throughout the White House that was created by African American artists, so you definitely don’t want to miss this.\nAs I mentioned previously, this weekend the President will be shifting the operation of the White House down to the “Winter White House” at Mar-a-Lago.  While in Florida, he’ll hold meetings and calls with advisors and staff to plan for another big week of action on behalf of the American people.  We’ll provide readouts of these as they occur.  By our count, as of this morning the administration has already racked up more than 60 significant actions:  21 executive actions, 16 meetings with foreign leaders, and 10 stakeholder meetings, to name a few.\nWe’re looking forward to another productive week next week.\nOn Monday, the President will visit Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base.\nWhile at MacDill, the President will receive command briefings from both CENTCOM and SOCOM, have lunch with the enlisted troops, and have an all-hands address to personnel.  General Dunford and General Flynn will also be present for the meetings, and the President will return to Washington that evening.\nWith that, I’m going to go my first Skype question seat.   Jackie Nespral from NBC 6 in South Florida.  Jackie.\nQ    Good afternoon.  On behalf of the viewers of South Florida, thanks so much for this opportunity.  You know, a lot of focus on foreign affairs this week, a new sanctions announced today against Iran, and of course Miami, as you know, is home to the largest Cuban-American community in the country.  And during the campaign, President Trump talked about his discontent with the warming of U.S.-Cuba relations implemented by President Obama.  And in the last days of his administration, he ended the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy, leaving thousands of Cubans in limbo.\nSo my question is twofold.  A, has there been any contact between your administration and the Cuban government?  And B, are there any plans to change the current policy right now?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jackie.  We are in the midst of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba.  The President is committed to an agenda of ensuring human rights for all citizens throughout the world.  And as we review those policies in Cuba, that will be forefront in their policy discussions, but there is nothing that we have on that front at this point.\nFrancesca Chambers.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Today, the United States put new sanctions on Iran.  Previously, this morning, the President had said that they were playing with fire.  You said that appropriate actions would continue to be taken.  Is this the full extent of the punishing actions that we’re seeing right now?  And are military options still on the table in response to the administration saying that all options are on the table?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks for the question.  I think one of the things that the President has said throughout the campaign, during the transition, and since becoming President is that he doesn’t like to telegraph his options.  That’s how he believes that you can have a much greater successful option.\nSo I’m not going to go into the full extent, and I think today’s sanctions really represent a very, very strong stand against the actions that Iran has been taking and make it very clear that the deal that they struck previously was not in the best interest of this country, and that President Trump is going to do everything he can to make sure that Iran is stayed in check.\nQ    So it is possible that there are more actions coming, though?\nMR. SPICER:  I just -- I would never rule anything off the table.  I think the President has made it clear throughout his time that that’s what going to happen.\nJeff.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Sean.  I wanted to ask about one of the members that has been announced as being part of President Trump’s team -- it's Gina Haspel.  Senator Ron Wyden has written to the President saying that her background makes her unsuitable to be the CIA Deputy Director.  And what he was specifically referencing was her role in the enhanced interrogation program that the CIA had during the course of the Bush administration.  Do you believe that this background is a disqualifier for that position?\nMR. SPICER:  I think she has had an unbelievably distinguished career as a covert operative.  She basically gave up that to come out and serve in this role at the request of Director Pompeo, and I think she has been a very, very distinguished servant to the American people and is highly qualified for that position.\nNext, I'm going to go to Josh McElveen over at -- from WMUR in New Hampshire.\nQ    Hey, Sean, thanks for taking the question.  I know you're looking forward to the Patriots coming down in a couple of months -- a lot of people up here are hoping that happens as well.  Getting to business, though, for more than two years, the number-one public health and safety threat facing this state is the heroin and opioid crisis.  During the campaign, the President promised to be swift and aggressive when it came to this problem -- stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border.  Increasingly, though, the problem lies in synthetic fentanyl being cooked up in labs in the northeast.  What is the administration doing on that front as well as the treatment aspect of addiction?\nAnd secondly, if I may, with the understanding it is a state issue, New Hampshire is poised to become a \"right to work\" state, but the vote is expected to be close.  Given the administration's favorable view of \"right to work,\" is it actively engaged in that effort?  And if not, what is the general message from the White House?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Josh.  First, on the opioid crisis, that is a major problem for not just New Hampshire but for so many states across the country.  I think one of the things beyond the health issue is to make sure that we're looking at borders use.  And the flow of heroin through our southern border is something that the President obviously takes -- that's part of his whole strong immigration stance, strong border security, having that wall built, having additional assets on the southern border will go a long way to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country from our southern border up through the states.\nIt was obviously, as you mentioned, a big issue that he made in New Hampshire throughout the primary and continued so on the campaign.  And that's something that as soon as Tom Price and others are confirmed throughout the department, this has got a health component to it, it's got a border issue to it.  So there is a multi-government approach that needs to be taken to the opioid crisis.\nWith respect to right to work, I think you accurately portrayed it.  The President believes in right to work.  He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what's in the best interest for job creators.  Obviously, the Vice President has been a champion of this as well.  It's something that is a big deal in Indiana and something that he has championed as well.\nBlake.\nQ    Sean, I want to ask you about Dodd-Frank.  Beyond the executive order that's going to be signed here momentarily, is the administration planning on or working with Congress to overturn certain portions of the law itself that can be done with an executive order?  If so, what might that be?  What might that timeline be?  And can you say if a full repeal of Dodd-Frank is actively being considered or not?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's two aspects of this.  There's the administrative piece, which he's starting to address through executive action, and then there's a legislative piece that I think we're going to work with Congress on.  But I mean, I think I'd go back to what I said earlier -- that Dodd-Frank has been both a disaster in terms of the impact that it's had, but also it hasn't achieved the goal.  And I think that there's no question that the President talked about this extensively, the impact that it's had.  And it's not an either-or.  It's, frankly, just not doing what it set out to do.  And so I think we're going to continue not just to act through administrative action, but through working with Congress and figuring out a legislative fix.\nMajor Garrett.\nQ    Sean, meeting with the Australian ambassador here yesterday with Chief of Staff Priebus and Steve Bannon -- can you describe what that meeting was about?  And did the administration make a commitment -- which we heard from the State Department yesterday -- that, in fact, all of those subject to the Obama administration agreement are still possible refugee re-settlers just with extreme vetting or some sort of process?  What was communicated?\nAnd on the Iran sanctions, Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary.  He was, of course, in charge of sanctions at the Treasury Department before.  Oftentimes these are a long time in development.  Were these sanctions something that were kind of on his desk or have been identified, and that's what made them so, if not easy, available to enact so rapidly?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think those are -- I think you correctly pointed out -- I mean, he served in the last administration.  These kind of sanctions don't happen quickly, but I think the timing of them was clearly in reaction to what we've seen over the last couple days.  We knew we had these options available to us because they had been worked through the process, but we acted swiftly and decisively today because the timing was right.  So they were in the pipeline, they had been staffed and approved, and the President made the decision that now was the time to do it based on recent action.\nChief of Staff Priebus and Chief Strategist Bannon did meet with the Prime Minister yesterday.  I think they had a very productive --\nQ    The ambassador.\nMR. SPICER:  The ambassador.  Thank you.  Appreciate the correction.  They did have a very productive and candid conversation.  We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Turnbull, and it was a follow-up on the call.  But we're going to continue to work through this.  We're going to honor the commitments that we've made in some way, meaning that we are going to vet these people in accordance with the agreement that happened.  And we'll continue to have further updates as we do.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ    Sean, your statement last night on settlements in Israel -- has there been a shift in U.S. policy?  While you said that you didn't think that they were helpful to achieving peace, you also didn't think that they were an impediment to peace, which would represent a departure from both Obama and Bush.  And there was no reaffirmation of a two-state solution in that statement.  So where are you on that?\nMR. SPICER:  The President is committed to peace.  That's his goal.  And I think when the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu meet here on the 15th, that will obviously be the topic on that.  At the end of the day, the goal is peace.  And I think that's what you have to keep in mind.  I think that is going to be a subject that they discuss when they meet on the 15th, and that's as far as I want to go on that.\nQ    Sean, back to the settlement thing.  What is your position on settlements in terms of whether or not they -- I mean, you said that they were not an impediment to peace, but you also don't want them building new ones.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    So where are you --\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, I think the statement is very clear about that.  We don't believe that the existence of current settlements is an impediment to peace, but I think the construction or expansion of existing settlements beyond the current borders is not going to be helpful moving forward.\nTrey.\nQ    Two for you.  Seventeen members of Congress requested that President Trump not interfere with the current way unemployment is calculated by the Department of Labor.  Does the President intend to comply with their request?  And a related question -- how many of the 227,000 jobs added to the U.S. in January does the President attribute to his administration versus the Obama administration?\nMR. SPICER:  I think, look, when you look at the confidence indexes, I'm not going to get into -- unfortunately, we don't have that kind of a breakdown.  I think that you've seen the actions that he's taken, whether it's Carrier or some of the other companies -- Sprint, SoftBank.  Clearly there is a desire for companies to want to come be part of this Trump agenda and build and manufacture, create jobs, bring jobs back.  But I'm not at liberty to start parsing the BLS and other reports as far as where that comes down.\nBut look, his team, led by Gary Cohn, was really pleased with the numbers this morning.  Obviously, we're pleased that we're -- 227,000 jobs is a great kickoff.  We hope they get better.  We know that there's a lot more work to do, and that's why the President continues to meet with business leaders, union leaders to help figure out how we can grow the economy.\nAshley.\nQ    The government revealed in an Alexandria court case today that over 100,000 visas have now been revoked as part of the President's travel ban.  Does that include visa holders who are already in the United States?  And will the government begin finding them and trying to deport them?\nMR. SPICER:  I'll have to get back to you on that.  I don't have all the details on that right now.\nQ    Six hours ago, the President tweeted that professional anarchists, thugs and paid protestors are proving the point of millions of people who voted to make America great again.  Does the administration have any intention of investigating the groups who have been rioting at conservative or pro-Trump events?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we know who they are.  I don't know that we need to do an investigation.\nQ    Has the President seen the letter sent from Senator McCain yesterday?  And if so, is he looking into arming the Ukrainians?\nMR. SPICER:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you on that.\nCharlie.\nQ    Ambassador Nikki Haley came out with a strong statement on Russia yesterday.  Does the administration have plans to keep the sanctions against Russia in place, or do they have any intention of adding more sanctions?\nMR. SPICER:  So there's two things.  One, I think I commented the other day on the sanctions that Treasury put out.  Those are, in fact, routine -- or the clarification -- they are a routine clarification that occurs.  With respect to the sanctions, I think Ambassador Haley made it very clear of our concern with Russia's occupation of Crimea.  We are not -- and so I think she spoke very forcefully and clearly on that.\nIf I can, I'd like to go to the third Skype question.  Christopher Sign from ABC15 in Arizona.\nQ    Sean, thank you for doing this.  Hello from a sunny and beautiful Phoenix.  With the likely confirmation on the horizon with a new Veteran Affairs Secretary, there has been discussion regarding privatizing the VA.  There's also still concerns regarding wait times, even overall care and some reports regarding a suicide rate.  What is the reform that the administration is seeking here?  Also, will the administration protect whistleblowers?\nSecond part of the question -- we've seen protests here in Phoenix, as in the nationwide as well.  When you talk about unity, what is the administration doing to bring more unity to the nation, and even more transparency?  As here in Phoenix, we saw that secret meeting on the tarmac.  How is the administration repairing all of this?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Chris.  First, I mean, I think the President, mostly through deed, continues to show that he wants to bring people together in this country, figure out how to move the country forward, both economically, job-wise.  I think that is something that he continues to show a desire for.  He talked about it in his inaugural address and the prayer breakfast.\nSo I think he's going to continue to show through both word and deed his desire to move the country forward.  I'm trying to think -- can you go back to the first part?\nQ    That's all right -- the confirmation -- the likely confirmation of the VA Secretary.\nMR. SPICER:  Oh yeah, Dr. Shulkin.  Yeah, look, I think first and foremost on VA reform, the number one thing is to get Dr. Shulkin confirmed.  And so many of these, as I brought up in the past couple days, it's hard to talk about how we're going to enact an agenda of reform when Senate Democrats continue to slow-walk some of these folks.  And I think that's a big problem.  Dr. Shulkin is the right individual to reform the VA -- to understand whether it's lending or medical care, the problems and the challenges that we face at the VA.  These are people who have served our nation and deserve the best care they can get, whether that's the mortgage lending, health care, or the variety of other stuff that the VA serves or provides to our veterans.  And I think that what the President has done is talk to people like Dr. Toby Cusgrove at Cleveland Clinic and other business leaders about providing a better approach to serving the needs of our veterans.\nRight now, you're right, there are still wait times that are unacceptable.  There's care that's unacceptable.  We've got to address that, and he's going to continue to do it.\nDavid Jackson.\nQ    Sean, during the campaign, candidate Trump repeatedly said he was going to void the Iranian nuclear deal.  Bottom line -- is he going to do that, or is he going to let it stay?\nMR. SPICER:  I think today's action speaks for itself in terms of the sanctions.  He's made it very, very clear, David, that the deal that was struck was a bad deal, that we gave Iran too much and we got too little for it.  And I think that he is going to continue to be tough on Iran in a way that wasn’t done in the last eight years.  I think today's actions and the way that we expedited those sanctions are another example of how he's going to stay tough on them.\nLet me go to the fourth Skype seat.  Dale Jackson from WVNN Talk Radio in Huntsville, Alabama.\nQ    Sean, thank you very much for taking questions from outside the elite media bubble there in D.C.  My question is about immigration.  Donald Trump made this the forefront of his campaign, the foundation of it, yet the DACA and DAPA programs still exist.  And I learned from a member of Congress yesterday that the Trump administration is still issuing the work permits that (inaudible) individuals.\nQuestion one is, when are these programs going to be ended?   And question two, when will they stop issuing work permits to these individuals?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Dale.  I think as you know, Secretary Kelly just assumed office.  We are reviewing these programs.  We've made it very clear that we'll have further updates on immigration referring to DACA and DAPA.  The President has made significant progress on addressing the pledge that he made to the American people regarding immigration problems that we face, and I think we're going to see more action on that in the next few weeks.\nYes, sir.\nQ    Sean, yesterday the President described NAFTA as a catastrophe.  We've heard about his concerns with Mexico, but I'm wondering if you can outline some of the irritants that he finds along the Canadian border, and if there's any talk of a meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau.\nMR. SPICER:  I think he has spoken to Prime Minister Trudeau.  I know that they're looking at setting up a time to come down.  We've been in constant contact with Canadian officials, and I think that will be a meeting that is set up very shortly.\nSarah.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Russia's foreign minister has pressed the administration for further details on the President's plans to establish safe zones in Syria.  The President has said to have discussed this yesterday with King Abdullah.  When can we expect further details on that plan?\nMR. SPICER:  That's a good question.  I think that we are -- as you noted in the readouts from last weekend, that has been a subject that has come up with all of the Middle East leaders that he's talked about.  It's an area that he feels strongly about.  And I think as he continues to have follow-up conversations, we can expect further details.  It's something that -- Secretary Tillerson obviously just got sworn into office, -- that there will be further follow-up on that.\nYeah.\nQ    The President will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Abe next Friday.\nMR. SPICER:  Yes.\nQ    So what's the main topic for the meeting?  Will the President tell Japanese Prime Minister Abe that Japan should pay more and pick up all the expense (inaudible) in Japan?\nMR. SPICER:  I think there's going to be a lot of both trade and national security.  I think as we get closer to that meeting, I'll have further information on it.  But right now, as you can imagine, there's an economic aspect to this, and then there's a national security aspect to this.\nGlenn.\nQ    Sean, you have referenced polls a couple of times from the podium, but a poll came out today.  CBS says the President has a 40 percent approval rating.  We've seen the approval rating drop during the transition period.  He talked about polls a great deal during the campaign.  A, what do you think that says about the way the American people are looking at these actions that he's taking?  And, B, what do you think it says about his pledge to unite the country on the eve of his election?\nMR. SPICER:  I think there's also a Rasmussen poll that showed he had a 51 percent approval rating.  You had an Ipsos/Reuters poll that other day that showed -- and again, I don’t have it handy, but a majority of people approved --\nQ    (Inaudible) those.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I think that as the President's policies continue to get enacted, for all the hysteria regarding his efforts to protect the country, on those seven countries where we didn’t have the proper vetting in place to ensure that the American people were safe, what we did have was a very high response from the American people in support of that.  His policies continue to do it.  The President understands this is a marathon, and not a sprint.  And as he continues to get people back to work, protect this country, I think the poll numbers will act in accord.\nQ    Sean, you mentioned the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Does the administration intend to keep Richard Cordray as the head of that agency?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t have a staff announcement on the CFPB right now, but we'll see where we go.\nQ    You criticize the bureau broadly, but do you want to see it stay in place?\nMR. SPICER:  I think we'll have further updates on that.  That's an area that we need to work with Congress on.\nApril.\nQ    Okay, Sean, two things.  One, you said something about President Trump talking on the Facebook Live that he was going to talk about Black History Month and issues pertaining to the African American community.  When you first came, a couple days into the administration, I asked you about the agenda, the black agenda that he had possibly formulated or he was formulating as he came out maybe the day before with the issue of Chicago, or the day after -- something around that time -- Chicago and sending the Feds in if it doesn’t change.  Has he now formulated a plan to deal with the black community, not just with issues of law and order?  What is that --\nMR. SPICER:  I mean, he had a meeting with African American leaders the other day in the Roosevelt Room.  I think part of this is, to your point, it isn’t just law and order -- it's jobs, it's education, it's health care, small business lending.  There's a lot that goes along with that agenda.  And I think part of these business meetings they have are about hiring and small business and job creation.  All of those issues, I think, are at the forefront of small business -- or that community.  So it's not just a single thing.  I think that there's a lot, whether it's crime and law and order, or education, health care, small business, job creation.  That impacts that entire segment of the population, whether they're living in a rural part of the country or an inner city.  And I think that's what he's really focused on right now.\nQ    Sean --\nQ    Wait, I'm not finished.  So he's now formulating the agenda?\nMR. SPICER:  Absolutely.\nQ    Okay.  So the second question -- CVE.  What's on the table for that?\nMR. SPICER:  We're not getting -- I have nothing to announce on that right now.\nQ    You have nothing to announce, but people are concerned --\nMR. SPICER:  I understand people.  I understand we've heard a lot of rumors about what may or may not.  When we have something to announce on that, we will do it.  But I don’t think it should be any surprise that the President, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his -- keeping this country safe.  And so I don’t have anything further for you on that.  I'm just --\nQ    What about excluding people -- there are reports about excluding white supremacists from --\nMR. SPICER:  There are a reports.  I don’t have anything for you.  I just said I don’t have anything for you, but I will be very clear that this President's commitment to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism is something that is at the forefront of his agenda.  And I know that there's been a lot of reports about where that program or that effort is going to lie.\nQ    Is there going to be any kind of target on the issues of white supremacy?\nMR. SPICER:  I have nothing else.  Thank you, April.\nCecilia.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  The President has been using some tough talk, tough language on Iran -- \"playing with fire.\"  Should Americans be ready for the possibility of military action with Iran?  Is that on the table?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I've said this before, the President has been very clear:  He doesn’t take options off the table but he understands the impact of something like that.  The sanctions today I think are going to be very, very strong and impactful.  And I hope that Iran realizes that after the provocative measures that they've taken, that they understand that this President and this administration is not going to sit back and take it lightly.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  On Monday, several published reports saying that it will be a tie in the Senate on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, and Mike Pence will have to cast a historic tie-breaking vote as Vice President.  Should we be watching for any surprises?  Has the Congressional Affairs Office perhaps gotten one more vote from the \"no\" camp into the \"yes\"?  Or do you expect the Vice President to be on hand to confirm her?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I would say this:  Betsy DeVos, as I mentioned before, is an unbelievable champion of education -- for children, for teachers, for parents.  I hope that that vote gets 60, 70 votes.  She is an unbelievable, remarkable woman who has fought very hard to improve our nation's education system and to make sure that schools are serving children.  And I think that we are going to make sure we do everything we can, and we feel 100 percent confident that she will be confirmed Monday night and be the next Secretary of Education.\nThank you, guys.  Have a great weekend.  The President is about to sign executive orders.  I hope you all have a great weekend.  To those of you who can't travel down to Florida, we'll be gaggling on the plane on Monday.  Thank you.  Have a great weekend.\nEND\n1:07 P.M. EST\n#8-02/03/2017", "timestamp": "2017-02-03T00:00:00", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/3/2017, #8"}

Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:32 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Happy Groundhog Day.  We've got six more weeks of winter, apparently.  Luckily, for those of you who are going to be joining the President down to Florida this weekend, you'll get some time to get a glimpse of summer at the \"Winter White House\" in Mar-a-Lago.\nThe President is going to start his meeting at 1:00 sharp.  You probably just saw the b-roll of folks from Harley rolling on in, literally.  So I’m going to try to keep this a little quick.\nThe President signed a proclamation yesterday ushering in Black History Month.  He looks forward to an engaging and informative month of events honoring the enormous contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history.\nLast night, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of the next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in the Oval Office.  As the President said last night, Secretary Tillerson is a man who’s already respected all over the world for the tremendous life that he’s led, and now will bring his years of experience to the critical task of making our nation safer, more prosperous, and more secure.\nIt’s time to bring a clear-eyed focus to our foreign affairs, and now with Secretary Tillerson at the helm of the State Department, we’ll do just that.  We'll strengthen our alliances, form new ones, and enhance America’s interests throughout the world.\nSpeaking of the President’s excellent nominees, praise is pouring in from around the country for his pick for Supreme Court.  The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch is a “legal superstar\"; “an outstanding choice,” says the New Hampshire Union Leader.  The Richmond Times-Dispatch says the “initial reaction” was “to cheer.”  The South Florida Sun Sentinel touted his “excellent qualifications.”\nYesterday, Judge Gorsuch had his first round of meetings on the Hill.  Unfortunately, Senate offices aren’t in the habit of releasing editorials, but from everything we heard, the Judge knocked it out of the park on the Senate as well.  The President looks forward to a fair and speedy confirmation process for this exceedingly qualified nominee and jurist.\nIn my last briefing, I read out a list of the senators Judge Gorsuch met with.  In addition to the meeting with Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Judiciary Chairman Grassley, and Senators Hatch and Gardner, the Judge also met with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.  Recently, Senator Manchin expressed his belief that Judge Gorsuch could win enough Democrats to hit 60 votes.  I’ll agree with the Senator there on that one.  I mean, we have to have a few Trump-state Democrats who want to win re-election.\nBut, as I pointed out yesterday, this so-called 60 vote “standard” is simply not accurate.  Democrats are grasping at straws to block the confirmation of an unquestionably qualified nominee.  I’ll repeat, neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama put forward were subject to the 60-vote threshold.  So although I agree with Senator Manchin that Judge Gorsuch will probably get enough Democrats to get to 60, it’s just simply not ever been a requirement.\nNow, on to the events of today.  The President started his day by attending the National Prayer Breakfast.  It's a tradition that continued over six decades, going back to President Eisenhower.  The President thanked the American people for their faith and prayers that have sustained and inspired him, noting that the five words that he has heard more than any others as he’s traveled throughout the country are, “I'm praying for you.”\nHe spoke at length about the ISIS genocide against Christians and the oppression of peace-loving Muslims, as well as the threats of extermination against the Jewish people, and made it clear that he believes the United States has a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.\nHe encouraged Americans to remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  With that goal in mind, the President remarked that he's taken action to ensure that the United States will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread throughout our nation.  In the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and reject any form of oppression or discrimination.\nThe President also committed to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and allowing our representatives of faith to speak freely and without retribution.\nIn a particularly poignant moment during his remarks, the President recalled yesterday his visit to Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief Ryan Owens as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  After honoring Chief Owens for giving his life in defense of the American people, the President quoted John 15:13:  “Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”\nAfter returning to the White House this morning, the President held a legislative affairs staff meeting in the Oval Office with his team.  The team continues to work closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, extensive outreach is underway on Capitol Hill and we look forward to the Judge receiving a swift and fair hearing.\nBetween his meetings, the President was pleased to see that EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt was voted out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  As has unfortunately become the practice, Democrats again boycotted the hearing, requiring a suspension of the rules in order to advance his nomination.\nFollowing the strategy session, the President met with Senators Hatch, Wyden and Congressmen Brady and Neal.  This meeting was an opportunity for the President to meet with the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee to help chart the future of U.S. trade policy.  The President has put together an all-star trade team that will work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative and the committees led by these members to craft new trade deals.\nThe President has expressed his concern time and again with NAFTA, which he believes is an out-of-date agreement.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the best and fairest treatment of U.S. workers and businesses, and the President believes that those interests are best secured by bilateral, rather than multilateral trade deals.  He looks forward to working closely with the USTR and Congress when it comes to issues of trade.\nFor those of you who weren’t outside and just saw the Harleys roll up, it’s no surprise that this afternoon the President will host a meeting and listening session with Harley-Davidson executives and union representatives.  For a list of those individuals, please contact our office.\nHarley-Davidson has been an American success story since 1901, when William S. Harley, at age 21, completed the blueprint drawing of an engine designed to fit into a bicycle.  In 1903, Harley-Davidson began building motorcycles in the United States. And today, the company has approximately 6,000 employees and $6 billion in annual revenue.  The company’s global headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- which may have had something to do with them getting in so quickly.  And there's a certain staffer.\nToday, the President will welcome to the White House the latest generation of Harley-Davidson executives to discuss how to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and factories in the United States.  Beyond the company executives, representatives from the machinists and steel workers unions were also be in attendance.\nTheir motorcycles have carried our American servicemembers in war.  They carry our police officers that keep us safe.  They carry the Secret Service as they protect our presidents.  And they bring joy to millions of Americans and throughout the world -- and others throughout the world, rather.  The President is looking forward to hosting these leaders from one of America’s truly great entrepreneurial success stories.  The American worker built this country, and the President is focused on restoring a government that puts their interests first.\nA few administrative notes.  The National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, today announced additions to the NSC senior staff.  David Cattler will be a Deputy Assistant to the President for Regional Affairs.  John Eisenberg, Deputy Assistant to the President, NSC Legal Advisor, and Department [Deputy] Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs.  Kevin Harrington, Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning.  And Kenneth Juster, Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs.\nLastly, we had a great reaction to our Skype introduction seats yesterday.  I know we've had a tremendous amount of requests pouring in from around the country.  Please contact the press office if you know of any that has an interest in joining us in the future.\nIn terms of the schedule for tomorrow, the President will host a Strategic and Policy Forum.  Then, in the afternoon, the President will have lunch with General Flynn before departing down to Mar-a-Lago later in the day.\nWith that, I’ll take some questions.\nKatie Pavlich.\nQ    Hi, Sean.  Thanks for the question.  Today, President Trump talked about Christian genocide at the National Prayer Breakfast, and last year the Obama State Department officially declared a genocide by ISIS against Christians and other minority and religious groups in the Middle East and North Africa.  Now that Rex Tillerson has been sworn in as the Secretary, what specifically is the administration planning to do to comply with the legal obligations of protecting these groups under the U.N. 1948 Treaty?\nMR. SPICER:  That's a great question.  I think Secretary Tillerson is learning his way around the building so far this morning.  He gave a great speech talking about his vision and goal for the State Department.  I think there will be further guidance coming out on that, Katie.  Right now, his job is to get in, get settled, talk to the employees, make sure they understood.\nBut back to the issue, obviously it’s important to President.  It was during -- throughout the campaign.  It’s something that he addressed this morning, and is something that he is committed to.  He talked about it in terms of the executive orders, and allowing Christian minorities in key countries seek asylum in the United States.  He recognizes that, in so many nations, these are the oppressed groups in accordance with how the U.N. defines refugees.  So I think you’ll see further guidance with that.\nJennifer.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  I have two questions, actually.  Today, the President renewed his promise to protect religious liberty, which he says is under threat.  Some Americans see religious liberty as code for discrimination.  Can you kind of give us a sense of how the President views this tension?\nMR. SPICER:  It’s an interesting question, because I do -- you know, this is something that comes up quite a bit.  I think there is a line.  We have freedom of religion in this country, and I think people should be able to practice their religion, express their religion, express areas of their faith without reprisal.  And I think that pendulum sometimes swings the other way in the name of political correctness.\nAnd I think the President and the Vice President both understand that one of the things that makes our country and this democracy so great is our ability to express our religion, to believe in faith, to express it, and to live by it.  And that’s where I think the important part is -- whether it’s a small business owner or employee, he wants to have some degree of expression of faith at the company.  And too often those voices get pushed out in the name of political correctness.\nSo he’s going to continue to make sure that we not only speak up for it, but find ways in which we can keep that line a little less blurred and make sure that the pendulum doesn’t swing against people.  We shouldn’t impose a religion on anybody.  We’re free to express our religion or be -- you know, not have one.  That’s obviously, in our country, an equally valid way of living your life.  But at the same time, I think people who want to express their faith shouldn’t be ostracized because they want to live that.\nMajor.\nQ    If you could give us an example, if you could, of the pendulum swinging in the direction of political correctness.  And how is that going to inform the President with this executive order?  And as you may know, a draft is circulating around town and many have wondered if that is going to be a way to either silence those on the left or be a threat to the LGBTQ community.  Talk us through both of those.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think if you look back to the Little Sisters case, if you look back to other businesses that were, under Obamacare --\nQ    Would you put Hobby Lobby in that category?\nMR. SPICER:  I would, yeah.  Absolutely.  I think there’s several businesses and several institutions -- Catholic institutions and others -- that have been mandated or attempted to mandate certain things that they may or may not do or how they have to treat their employees.  Those are instances where clearly the pendulum is swinging a different way, where you are not carving out institutions or the ability for privately held businesses to conduct themselves to live according to their faith or their moral compass.\nAnd so there’s clearly a lot of evidence in the last couple years of the government coming in with regulations and policies that have, frankly, denied people the ability to live according to their faith.\nQ    From the President’s point of view, that’s discriminatory in itself.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s -- like I said, I think it’s a pendulum.  And where the President is, is that he wants to make sure that you don’t penalize someone for wanting to express their faith, and that to the extent that we can keep that line a little less blurred and allow people who don’t believe in a faith or have an opposing faith, make sure that they are equally comfortable in the workplace.  But we shouldn’t penalize people or mandate them to abide by certain policies or regulations which are in direct contradiction to their faith.\nQ    And what about the executive order, Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  There’s right now no executive orders that are official or able to read out.  We maintain that there’s nothing new on that front.\nQ    (Inaudible) drafted along --\nMR. SPICER:  It's not a question of -- there are a lot of ideas that are being floated out -- I mentioned this the last couple days.  But that doesn’t mean -- part of it is, as the President does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas, and on a variety of subjects there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process.  But until the President makes up his mind and gives feedback and decides that that’s final, there’s nothing to announce.\nQ    Thank you.  In light of the tragedy that happened in Quebec City last week, which Prime Minister Trudeau is actually calling an act of terrorism, what is the President doing, what initiatives is he taking to make sure that that kind of homegrown -- because he was a Canadian citizen -- homegrown terrorism, homegrown violence doesn’t happen within our country?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, there’s a lot of things.  Number one, he’s talked cyber -- I mean, he’s looking at it from every angle.  I think the first thing is to make sure that we look at our borders.  You’ve got to protect your own people first, then you’ve got to look at the cyber threats.  I mean, so there is a holistic approach to both immigration and there’s a direct nexus between immigration and national security and personal security that he has to look at.\nBut then it’s a multi-tiered step.  You look at the borders, you look at who we’re letting in, and you also look at what we’re doing internally with our intelligence agencies and the FBI that make sure that we’re looking at -- whether it’s the cyber threats that we face or other terrorist activities -- but making sure that we’re working with the NSA and the FBI to be ahead of the curve, if you will.\nQ    If I may, these are homegrown -- Oklahoma City was an American kid.\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.\nQ    Okay.  That’s all.  That’s what I’m asking.\nMR. SPICER:  That’s what I’m saying.  But I think that, part of it is, looking at using the assets that we have here -- the NSA, the FBI -- looking at using the different agencies to see if we can get ahead of the curve and see things.  And a lot of times, that’s been a very big issue, is getting ahead of the curve for when there are telltale signs, having the reporting systems up, working with the various agencies.  But it’s a multi-effort process, if you will.\nKristen.\nQ    Sean, thank you.  Why is the administration easing sanctions against Russia?\nMR. SPICER:  We’re not easing sanctions.  The Treasury Department -- it is, from what I understand, it’s a fairly common practice for the Treasury Department, after sanctions are put in place, to go back and to look at whether or not there needs to be specific carve-outs for either industries or products and services that need to be going back and forth.  But I would refer you back to the Treasury Department on that one.\nQ    Hold on, Sean.  The language on the Treasury Department website suggests that you are, in fact, easing sanctions that authorizes certain transactions with the Federal Security Service.  Does that not suggest a shift from what was put in place --\nMR. SPICER:  No, it doesn’t.\nQ    So explain --\nMR. SPICER:  It is, from what I understand, a regular course of action.  The Treasury does, quite often, when there are sanction imposed, but I would refer you back to the Treasury Department.\nQ    Thank you.  Could I ask you to describe the tone of the call on the weekend between the Australian Prime Minister and the President, and also outline the President’s concerns about the refugee deal in question?  And I asked you this earlier this week, but could you clarify whether the deal is on or not?  Because the President tweeted last night “I will study this dumb deal,\" implying that he's still considering it.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  The President had a very cordial conversation with Prime Minister Turnbull, where they went through an extensive discussion of this deal.  The President is unbelievably disappointed in the previous administration’s deal that was made and how poorly it was crafted, and the threat to national security it put the United States on.\nHe has tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and for the Australian people, and has agreed to continue to review that deal and to ensure that as part of the deal, which was always part of it, that we would go through a very, very extreme vetting process to ensure that every single person that is being offered up is coming here with peaceful intentions and poses no threat to the United States.\nSo he has ensured that while he has respect for the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister Turnbull, that we do not pose a threat to the United States of America, that the deal that was cut by the last administration is something that he is extremely, extremely upset with.  He does not like it, but out of respect for him, he’s going to allow that process -- continue to study it and allow it to move forward under the conditions that have been set -- that there will be extreme vetting on every single one of those individuals.\nQ    Just for clarity, the deal itself is still under review, so it’s not certain to proceed?  Or it will proceed as --\nMR. SPICER:  Part of the deal was that -- the deal allows for the United States to vet the individuals that are being offered up to be processed.  The President’s goal is to make sure that every single one of those people, in accordance with the deal and as discussed in the telephone conversation with the Prime Minister, is subject to extreme vetting to ensure that no one puts it.  But I cannot underscore how disappointed he was in the deal that was made and how he thought it was just a horrible deal that was offered up by the United States by the previous administration.\nSarah.\nQ    The President and his national security advisor have been clear the administration wants to put Iran “on notice,” but they haven’t specified what that is.  What options are on the table?  And are there any options, like military action, that might be off the table at this point?\nMR. SPICER:  So I think General Flynn was really clear yesterday that Iran has violated the Joint Resolution, that Iran’s additional hostile actions that it took against our Navy vessel are ones that we are very clear are not going to sit by and take.\nI think that we will have further updates for you on those additional actions, but clearly we wanted to make sure that Iran understood that they are on notice, this is not going un-responded to.\nJohn.\nQ    Thank you very much, Sean.\nQ    It was a Saudi vessel.\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Yes.\nQ    They thought it was an American, but it's a Saudi vessel.\nMR. SPICER:  Right, that’s right.  John.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  On January 27th, at the Republican retreat in Philadelphia, Vice President Pence had a closed-door meeting with House Republicans where several of them brought up the case of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.  There was an attempt to impeach him last year, which some of the leadership in the House felt was unfair to the commissioner, and they urged him to tell the President that given his entire record, he should fire him or ask for his resignation soon.  My sources said the Vice President said “I can hear you.”  Is there any pending action on the fate of Commissioner Koskinen?\nMR. SPICER:  I have nothing to update you on.\nHallie.\nQ    On Yemen, it was initially described, the raid over the weekend, as a successful raid by the administration.  There are now some questions and comments raised about the possibility of additional civilian casualties.  So I’ve got a couple of questions for you on this one.  Would you still stand by your characterization of the raid as “successful”?  Was the President given multiple options about this raid, or just one?  And were there consultations with the prior administration’s national security officials, military officials about the raid moving forward?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Actually, I’d like to just walk through that.  I appreciate you bringing this up.\nThere is -- let’s go through the tick-tock on that raid.  On November 7th, CENTCOM submitted the plan to DOD.  Clearly, that was under the last administration.  Legal teams were involved immediately when it was submitted to DOD.  On December 19th, the plan was approved by the Department of Defense and recommended that it be moved ahead.  It was sent then to the National Security Council staff here in the White House.  Again, this all happened under the previous administration.\nOn January 6th, there was an interagency deputies meeting.  The deputies recommended at that time that they go ahead.  It was so easily approved it was sent straight up.  The conclusion to hold was, at that time, to hold for what they called a “moonless night,” which, by calendar, wouldn’t occur until then-President-elect Trump was President Trump.\nOn January 24th, shortly after taking office, Secretary of Defense-then Mattis read the memo, resent it back up to the White House conveying his support.  On the 25th of January, the President was briefed by General Flynn on Secretary Mattis’s recommendation and the status of the operation, or potential operation.\nThe President asked to see Secretary Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford.  He then, on that evening, had a dinner meeting, which included the President, the Vice President, Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford, Chief of Staff Priebus, Jared Kushner, Chief Strategist Bannon, General Kellogg, General Flynn, and CIA Director Pompeo where the operation was laid out in great extent.  The indication at that time was to go ahead on Friday the 26th.\nIn the morning, the deputies committee met again.  It was not a necessary step because they had previously recommended and also reaffirmed their support for that.  On January 26th, the President signed the memo authorizing the action.\nSo it was a very -- not only was it a very, very though-out process by this administration, it had started back on November 7th in terms of -- clearly well before that, but it was a move forward by CENTCOM on November 7th.  This was a very, very well thought-out and executed effort.\nQ    Where was the President the night of the raid?  How did he learn about Chief Owens’s death?  And do you still stand by your characterization that it was successful?\nMR. SPICER:  The President was here in the residence.  He was kept in touch with his national security staff.  Secretary Mattis and others had kept him updated on both the raid and the death of Chief Owens, as well as the four other individuals that were injured.  So he was kept apprised of the situation throughout the evening.\nAnd again, I think -- I would go back to what I said yesterday:  It’s hard to ever call something a complete success when you have the loss of life, or people injured.  But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life here in America and against our people and our institutions, and probably throughout the world in terms of what some of these individuals could have done, I think it is a successful operation by all standards.\nAnd again, I want to reiterate, it is tough to ever use the word \"success\" when you know that somebody has lost their life.  But when you go back and look at an individual that dedicated their life to serving this country, and went over and over and over again knowing that this not only the risk that he took but wanted to do it because he knew the threat that these kind of individuals pose to our country and to our people, that's -- while not a success that you lost to him, you know that he died in sacrifice for someone else here in this nation.\nHunter Walker.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  I’ve seen some criticism of the President’s remarks at the prayer breakfast this morning.  Can you shed any light on why he thought that was a good venue to mock “The Apprentice” for its ratings?\nMR. SPICER:  Look, Mark Burnett, the creator of “The Apprentice,” who is a long-time supporter of the prayer breakfast but also has a personal relationship, was there.  He meant it as a light-hearted moment.  And I think if you look at the totality of his remarks, they were absolutely beautiful.  And I think to hone in on that, it was a light-hearted moment he was trying to have with a big supporter of the National Prayer Breakfast and a personal friend.\nGuys, I’ll be out tomorrow.  I want to make sure we all get to see the President now.  Thank you, guys.\nEND\n12:57 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:43 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thanks for coming.\nLast night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court.  It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia.  As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing.\nIn less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles.\nDuring his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators -- including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy -- were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006.\nWith as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate.\nNow that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia.\nJudge Gorsuch’s academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.\nLike Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text.  He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the -- he believes -- sorry, I almost screwed that one up -- (laughter) -- he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings.  He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background.\nAnd I would note, I think -- and I always want to caveat this -- but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the -- as someone he clerked for on the bench.  So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate.\nNow, on to the issues of the day.  Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month.  The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room.  The meeting also included some of the administration’s African American appointees.\nLater today, the President will issue a proclamation.  The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 -- excuse me, 1994 and 2004.  President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon.\nAt events throughout this entire month, we'll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders -- from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas.  African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that.\nContinuing with today’s schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night.  On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell.  And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner.\nWith Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it's a good time to talk about the confirmation process.  Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster.  They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified.  And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment.\nAlso this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, including David O'Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center;\nWayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute.\nPresident Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President.  He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law.\nThe attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign.  They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote.  The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor.\nThe President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson.  Mr. Tillerson’s tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination.\nLater this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  So far, between the Vice President and staff, we've had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the President’s nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court.\nNow, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination process.  Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where I’m going with that:  Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the President’s attempts to make America great again.\nJust today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present.  Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt’s hearing.  They're doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics.  The President’s Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote.\nIn other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today.  We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General.\nAdditionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- designee -- is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon.  And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon.\nA few more things before I open it up for questions.\nIn terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House.  The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady.  Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon.\nA few personnel announcements.  Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate:  Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General.\nOn another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the President’s executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry.  I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject.  For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking.  A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent -- which is a clear majority -- of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat.\nA Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country.  And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President’s top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he's taking to keep our country safe.\nFurther, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the President’s decision to take our national security so seriously.  The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the “structural problems” faced by these nations.\nI know that there was a question on Monday regarding Iran’s firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel.  I’d like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update.\nGENERAL FLYNN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran's destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East.\nThe recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.  These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.\nIn these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms.  The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk.\nPresident Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.  Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.\nThank you.\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, General.  We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff -- NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room.  Further details will be provided on that subject.  So thank you, General, with that.\nAs we start off, I mentioned yesterday I'm pleased that we've expanded the briefing room -- at least virtually.  And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I'm pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island.\nKim.\nQ    Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me okay?\nMR. SPICER:  We can.\nQ    Great.  Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city.  As we know, President Trump's executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them.  What I'm wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list, and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Kim.  I think the President's goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear.  We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe.  The goal is to make sure on two fronts.  One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that.  Furthermore, the President has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities.\nAs we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we'll have further updates on how we tend to -- on how that list will come out and when it will come out.  So I look forward to following up on that as well.\nWith that, David Jackson.\nQ    David isn't here but I'll ask a question.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  Go for it.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Maybe he's on Skype?  (Laughter.)\nQ    The President's daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing.  Can you tell me how that differs at all from the PDB?  Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally, and who is giving it to him?\nMR. SPICER:  He did receive an intelligence briefing today.  Congressman -- or Director Pompeo was here.  General Flynn, his national security advisor, his briefer.  So he receives an intelligence briefing and the PBD every day.\nQ    Is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the PDB?\nMR. SPICER:  I think it is a more comprehensive -- again, I think -- we went through this during the transition period, right?  There is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis, and I think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials.  But every single day, he does receive the PBD.  And then I think, on top of that, he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team.\nQ    But the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every day?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I can get back to you on that.  He does get the PBD every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team, yes.\nQ    Two quick questions.\nMR. SPICER:  We're not going to do this again.\nQ    On Black History Month.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    Is President Obama being invited to any of the Black History Month celebrations?\nMR. SPICER:  Not that I'm aware of.  It's day one.  We just started it off.  We'll have to get back to you on further details.  I think --\nQ    And if I may --\nMR. SPICER:  We have a lot -- there's a lot of activities, as I mentioned, that the President is going to do to celebrate and honor this month.  And this was just the first day of the month of February.\nQ    And today he made the comment about Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more.  Do you have any idea what specifically he was referring to?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's contribution -- I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made.  And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he's going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more.\nKristen.\nQ    Thank you.  Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by \"we're putting Iran on notice?\"\nMR. SPICER:  Well, as I mentioned, I think General Flynn and the NSC staff will have a briefing at 4:00 p.m.  They can go forward.  I'm not going to -- I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that -- their actions were both provocative and a violation, and making sure that they understood that we weren't going to sit by and not act on those actions.\nQ    Are you building the case to --\nMR. SPICER:  I'm just -- I'm not going to go any further than that, Kristen.\nQ    Okay, then let me ask you about -- let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings.  How does the President plan to get Chuck Schumer onboard with his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, when he has referred to him as a \"clown\" and accused him of fake tears?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think those are two things.  I think we're going to -- you look at the support that's already come out.  I think there's eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications.  And not just the Senate but I mean you look at the widespread support that came out for Judge Gorsuch last night across the spectrum.  No matter your philosophical view of the Court, I think his qualifications for the Court, his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified person.\nAnd so it's not just Chuck Schumer; I think the rest of the Senate as he goes up there -- but I think the interesting thing --\nQ    Sure --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on.  I understand that.  And I think Chuck Schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the Cabinet that he's more interested in politics than actually moving the government along.  And I think that is troubling.\nI would ask you that -- I think that the question needs to be asked to Chuck Schumer:  Why are you stalling all of these nominees?  Why are you insisting on new requirements that you didn't assume for Sotomayor or Kagan?  I mean, there's a point at which they need to get asked, why are they obstructing government at every step of the way?  There's an element to which they need to be held accountable as well.  They held certain standards in place for their nominees, both for the bench and for the Cabinet.  And the question is, are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on Republicans when they had nominees in a Democratic White House.\nQ    But does the President think that by personally insulting Chuck Schumer that's a way to get --\nMR. SPICER:  But again, Kristen, I think the goal is to get -- when -- but again, I would go back.  Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this.  There's a lot of comments that he's made and a lot of accusations that he's thrown out there and a lot of politics that he's played.  At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words.\nBlake.\nQ    Sean, the President today invoked the possibility on the Supreme Court, Sean, of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option.  If it gets to that point, is the White House comfortable with that path?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President made clear his goal today, which is, number one, he believes that Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated -- not only confirmed, but done so with a large bipartisan vote.  As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the Obama administration, and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy, definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did so.\nI think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the Democrats used when they had nominees up.  But I think the President made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down, but also that it is ultimately up to Senator McConnell and how he wants to operate this.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Just one question today.  Leading up to Judge Gorsuch's announcement last night and him coming out after, there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to Washington.\nMR. SPICER:  No, actually, John, he didn't.  That was media -- that was misreporting.  My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  So with all due respect, I can't be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here.  He never was at the White House.  My understanding is he had a meeting in eastern Pennsylvania with another judge.  But it was -- and, again, I'm not -- I don't track his whereabouts, but my understanding is he never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania yesterday.  So it was -- we announced when we were going to make this announcement.  I think it was a phenomenal way to introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and the United States Senate.  We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Unfortunately, none of them showed up.  But it was an opportunity for them and the American people to see an amazing choice that the President made for the bench.\nAnita.\nQ    My question, Sean, my question is --\nMR. SPICER:  You said one, John.\nQ    But I didn't ask the question.  My question is simply this:  With the support that he received, the people who called the President, would it be safe to say that Judge Hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon -- say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end of the term?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government.  He's an impressive, impressive jurist.  Obviously the four that really made that final list for the President were unbelievably impressive.  So I don't want to get in front of the President.\nHopefully he continues to have the President's support and is someone that the President was unbelievably impressed with.  So we'll have to see what vacancies come down the pipe.\nAnita.\nQ    I know you love when we say we have two questions.  I do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top.  First, you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the Department of Justice.  Why are they being nominated now, before Senator Sessions is there?  Is it because there's a lack of people?  Was he consulted?  Or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney general?\nMR. SPICER:  It's the normal process of getting those -- I've mentioned at a few briefings -- the deputies, the unders, and the actings are in the pipeline.  We announced one the other day for Homeland.  We've got Commerce was previously announced.  And so this is just a continuation of the process to fill --\nQ    So would then Senator Sessions -- I mean, in speaking with him --\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.  These are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of, 100 percent.\nQ    Okay.  And then the second question was, you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley Davidson executives.  There's reporting that he was supposed to go to Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to.  That was canceled because of the company.  Can you talk about that?\nMR. SPICER:  I just think -- look, it was easier for the executives to come here, considering the week and all of the activity that's been going on.  And we figured the easiest thing to do was -- again, no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing.  We looked at different options and, ultimately, the easiest thing to do in accordance with the President's schedule was to invite them here to Washington to talk about some of the stuff that we've been doing.\nQ    Are you worried about protesting?\nMR. SPICER:  We're not concerned.  I think we're not concerned about that.  We're concerned about American jobs, moving this economy forward, and we're excited to welcome them here to Washington to talk about the great work that they do and the many thousands of people that they employ.\nWith that, let me go to the -- we're going to be here a while, guys.  We'll go to the second Skype seat.  Natalie Herbick from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio.\nNatalie.\nQ    Secretary Spicer, thank you so much for this rare opportunity.  I appreciate it.  And I'm learning the ropes.\nMR. SPICER:  Natalie, you're coming back.  (Laughter.)\nQ    And I would like to quickly ask two questions, if I may.  The first one being, President Trump has been quick to take action on several issues he's addressed along the campaign trail.  And with that in mind, he made a stop here in Cleveland and he said that he would like to make cities like ours the economic envy of the world -- a bold statement.  So our viewers would love to know an example, a specific example, as to how he plans to do this sooner than later.\nMR. SPICER:  That's a great question, Natalie.  I think it's not just Cleveland but it's Detroit and so many of the other cities around the country.  You've heard the President talk about the need to rebuild our inner cities.  We were really impressed with Cleveland this past July -- we went there for the national convention -- the people of Cleveland, their desire and the rebound that the city has taken.  And I think that when you go to -- whether it's a city like Cleveland or Detroit through different tax and regulatory measures, there's a way that we can continue to bring manufacturing back, we can continue to bring jobs back.  And whether it's Harley Davidson or Carrier or Lockheed or Boeing or the GM, Fiat, Ford, these companies, he continues to talk with about how they can bring jobs back, relocate.  I think that was, again, another one of the conversations that he had with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday.  How can they bring jobs back?  How can we ease regulations to do that?\nSo it's about making sure that we have an environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to recognize the things that we can do, tax-wise and regulatory-wise, to allow that to flourish.\nCecilia.\nQ    Thank you.  And Steve Bannon can be heard on recording saying, \"Islam is a dark religion, not a religion of peace, a religion of submission.\"  Does the President share his chief strategist's apparent beliefs on Islam?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think the President has been very clear that his number one goal is not to target any one religion but places and areas where we believe that there is an issue.  That's what the executive order was all about the other day -- making sure that areas that we don't feel have the proper mechanisms in place to assure the security -- that when they travel to the United States, that we know that they're coming here for peaceful purposes.\nThe President's number-one goal has always been to focus on the safety of America, not the religion.  He understands that it's not a religious problem, it's a radicalization problem.  There's a big difference between Islam, the religion, and radical Islamic terrorists that come here to seek to do us harm.\nQ    But nothing about his comment that the President wants to distance himself from or even elaborate on?\nMR. SPICER:  I just think I made it clear that there's a difference between the President's view.\nYeah.\nQ    Thanks.  There have been multiple reports of people landing Saturday in the U.S. with valid visas who were denied entry and placed on flights back out of the country.  So that's in violation of at least five of these federal judges' orders that came down.  Is the White House working to ensure that those people illegally deported can return to the U.S.?  And are these court orders causing any second thinking about certain aspects of the order?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that we just -- we issued earlier today some clarification -- an update from the Counsel's Office that clarifies section 3C and 3E that legal permanent residents, LPRs, do not -- that the waiver -- you no longer need a waiver.  Initially, as the program was lifting off, the idea was that they would go through, be granted a waiver of which everyone was issued a waiver coming in.\nIn the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies to both the Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that the guidance is -- that all individuals are responsible for the administration implementation of this order -- that that does not apply.  They no longer need a waiver, because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won't need it anymore.\nQ    Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    On Glass-Steagall, the President during his campaign said that he supported a reestablishing of Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate the investment banks from the commercial banks.  There's legislation on both the House and the Senate side.  It's in the Republican program.  Mr. Mnuchin when he was queried on the Hill by Senator Cantwell, who is the author of one of the bills, was a little bit more ambiguous on this issue.  And I wish you could say something on where this President stands on this.\nMR. SPICER:  I think part of the reason that it's -- we've got to get a Treasury Secretary confirmed.  And I think that when we sit here and get asked questions about policy and you go department after department, -- whether it's Treasury, Energy, EPA, HHS, HUD, Education -- the list goes on and on.  And so you ask about issues and where the President's agenda is.  Well, the reason that the President nominated these highly qualified people was to implement his agenda.  And Senate Democrats continue to hold that up.  And I think when you -- you can't -- you're asking us about how we're going to move forward on an agenda, whether it's Glass-Steagall or so many other issues.  And at the same time, the Democrats are holding up the confirmation of these highly qualified people.  Until that occurs, it makes it a heck of a lot harder.\nQ    But the President --\nMR. SPICER:  Major Garrett.\nQ    -- still supports Glass-Steagall.\nMR. SPICER:  The President's position is consistent, yes.\nQ    Sean, a broad topic I'd like you to take on, which is dissent within the administration, and specifically related to the President's lunch with Rex Tillerson today.  More than 1,000 employees at the State Department, Foreign Service officers and others, have signed this dissent-gape.  Is it the President's position that Rex Tillerson, when he's confirmed, should go through the formal process, meet with those people, and have a dialogue as previous Secretaries of State have?\nAnd is it the President's point of view that when there is dissent, it can be rooted in a philosophical disagreement that's not necessarily in defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialogue, and that it can maybe inform him differently about policy?\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.  I think the President has always --\nQ    Because you said a couple days ago they should get out if they --\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no, I think there's a difference.  Just to be clear on this -- every American has a right to speak their mind.  That's one of the amazing beauties of this country.  You have the ability to write what you want through our First Amendment, and people have a right to speak out, and that's not hampered.  The point that I was making then is that if you believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to you, then you have to understand that the job, the way our government works is we elect a President, and that President gets to carry through their agenda that they set out with the American people during the campaign.\nAnd so they have a right to express it.  And I think Secretary Tillerson, for those who have gotten to meet him, has a very open mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas, as does the President, as evidenced through what did through the transition, and what he's done since he's become President.  He has met with groups, businesses, associations, Republicans, Democrats, independents, that have been supportive of him, that have not been supportive of him.  And I think that he's going to continue to do that.\nSo people have a right to speak their mind, but I think there's a difference between expressing dissent and concern, and not implementing a lawful order, as the acting Attorney General did the other night.\nBut again, I don’t mean to keep coming back to this, but you're asking what we'll do when Rex Tillerson becomes.  And part of the problem right now is I can't fully answer your question because Democrats are holding up and slow-walking this nomination.  So to presuppose what Rex Tillerson is going to do -- you know, again, I just -- it's ironic that we're being asked what these secretaries will do when they get into office, and the Democrats won't let them assume this, when we all know that the votes are there for them.\nQ    But I'm just talking about a particular process that has historically been (inaudible) in the State Department.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I think -- but again, I think for me to presuppose what Secretary-designee Tillerson is going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in, I don’t -- he probably will, I don’t know.  But it would be irresponsible of me to answer a question about what he's going to do before he actually gets sworn in.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Senate Democrats have been described as \"bitter\" over the manner in which Judge Merrick Garland was treated when he was nominated for the Supreme Court.  Do you feel, does the President feel that that bitterness is well-founded?\nMR. SPICER:  I don’t know, I'm not a Senate Democrat.  I think they have a right to feel the way they do.  I think we've explained our position, both during last year when this was going on, that we felt as though this was up to the voters to make a decision on.  And as I pointed out yesterday, so many voters made up their mind based on who they believe the candidates would appoint.  Mr. Trump -- then Mr. Trump -- then-candidate Trump, now President Trump was very clear about the type of people that he was going to put forth first in a list of 10 and then in a list of 11 additional ones.  So I think the American people knew clearly where he was going to go.  He followed through on that campaign promise.\nAnd I think that when you look at the number of people who solely based their vote on that, never mind it was -- and then you expand that, it was pretty clear that that was an important factor in the election.\nSo I understand it, but I also think that's -- we had an election, it was a major issue in that election, and I think that even when you look across the spectrum -- Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative -- Judge Gorsuch has an unbelievable record and is being praised for that record because of that.\nQ    I want to ask about Friday, and there's been some reporting that there will be a meeting with President Trump and JP Morgan CEO and others.  Can you tell us a little bit more about who else will be there and where things are at on financial reform?  What message does the President have for bankers, specifically, on financial reform?  We've heard so much about Obamacare and tax reform, but it seems like financial reform has sort of fallen by the wayside.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I wouldn’t agree with that.  I think that when you look at regulatory reform and tax reform, and all of the steps that he's been taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs, that's right in that wheelhouse.  I hope to have further updates on the schedule for you tomorrow, but I don’t now.\nMara.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  I have question about foreign policy, but I wanted to follow up.  You said that LPRs no longer need a waiver, but you didn’t answer the question about what about the people who were put on planes, people who were LPRs but would put on planes back to where they came from.  What happens to them?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think then they go through the process.  It depends if they're an LPR; if not, then they go through the application process.  So if they are an LPR, a legal permanent resident, then they are waived, they can come right through.\nQ    So they can come back again?\nMR. SPICER:  That's right.  But I don’t know how many cases that applies to.  I know that if they're not a legal permanent resident, then they have to go back.  And that's part of this vetting process.\nQ    Sean --\nQ    Wait, my question is about the fighting in Ukraine and Russia-backed rebels are moving the lines forward.  And I'm wondering if the President feels that Russia is testing him because this is coming so early in his administration before he's had a chance to fully assemble his team, and what he plans to do about it.\nMR. SPICER:  The President has been kept aware of, through his National Security Council and his national security team as a whole, what's been going on in the Ukraine, and we'll have further updates as we go on.\nQ    During the campaign last January, Donald Trump promised that on his first day in office he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools and on military bases.  When can we expect action on that?  And if so, can you share details of what we should expect?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think you've seen that the President has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the American people last night, being another example of that.  We're going to continue to move through this process, and I think we'll have further updates on where we are with respect to the rest of the EO process.\nWith that, I want to go to my third Skype seat, Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show.\nQ    Commander Spicer, it's a pleasure.  Thanks for your service to America, and thanks for the opportunity.  I've got a broad question.  The federal government is the biggest landlord in America.  It owns two-thirds of a billion acres of America.  I don’t think the Founders ever envisioned it that way.  Does President Trump want to start returning the people's land to the people?  And in the meantime, for a second question -- since that's in fashion these days -- can he tell the Forest Service to start logging our forests aggressively again to provide jobs for Americans, wealth for the Treasury, and not spend $3.5 billion a year fighting forest fires?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Lars.  I think the President has been very clear that as part of an overall comprehensive energy solution, that we've got to utilize the resources that we have, that the federal government owns, whether that's the forests or natural resources or minerals that exist above and below the ground, that we have too infrequently looked at our own resources and counted too much on foreign sources of energy.\nSo we're going to continue, as Congressman Zinke goes through the process to head up the Interior Department, and Governor Perry goes through his appointment -- his confirmation process, to get those individuals through, but then working together in areas where they have overlap and also on areas where they will act individually to realize, to look at those natural resources that we have and figure out how to best utilize them to benefit not just our energy, but also economic growth opportunities with that.\nDaniel Happer (ph)\nQ    I was wondering about executive orders.  You haven’t really explained why the President is using the executive orders in the manner that he's doing so.  Why not take this extreme vetting to Congress and have a congressional bill?  And why not -- I mean, what is the philosophy behind --\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I don’t think it's a binary choice, Daniel.  I don’t think it's \"only do this.\"  I think he has talked about -- especially in the area of immigration -- he's been very, very clear that this a huge priority for him.  And I think that he is going to continue to look at this from a holistic aspect.  In other words, visas, visa reform, the wall, our southern border, our northern border -- all of these things that -- you know, vetting.  Those are very, very comprehensive. And those things in which he can do through executive order and action, he will.  Those things that he can do through working with Congress legislatively, he's going to continue to do as well.\nToluse from Bloomberg.\nQ    The President's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, told The Financial Times yesterday that he believes that the euro is grossly unvalued, and Germany is benefiting from that and that's why we have a huge trade deficit with Germany and with Europe.  Does the President agree with that, that the euro is undervalued?  And if so, does he plan to do anything about it?\nMR. SPICER:  I think when it comes to currency valuation, I'm not going to get -- I think we've got a Secretary of Treasury that's in the confirmation process.  And once that happens, I think then Secretary Mnuchin will be able to address that, as well.\nQ    Sean, Dan Hausle, 7News of Boston.  I'd like to ask you about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding --\nMR. SPICER:  I was hoping you were going to ask about the Patriots.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Well, I would like to ask you about that.\nMR. SPICER:  You'll get a second -- (laughter) --\nQ    Okay, I'll get a second.  But can you talk about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding Justice Gorsuch around Capitol Hill?\nMR. SPICER:  Sure.  Look, Senator Ayotte is someone who's respected on both sides of the aisle.  She has a lot of great relationships.  She's a former attorney general.  She understands the judicial process very well, but she's also -- I mean, this process is a relationship process by and far.  You're going around introducing a judge, someone who has not generally been exposed to the legislative process, definitely not the congressional process.\nQ    Her relationship with President Trump was stranger in the campaign, and kind of --\nMR. SPICER:  That's right.  And I think that that goes and shows, as I've mentioned several times both through the transition and early, the President is not holding some kind of test about what degree of support you had for him.  He wants the best and brightest to continue to serve this country in whatever capacity they can.  I think Senator Ayotte very, very helpfully offered up her services.  She's got a lot of relationships on both sides of aisle.  She's got a tremendous amount of experience in this field.  And I think the President thought she was extremely qualified to do this to help shepherd this unbelievably qualified justice through this process.\nAnd so she, as well as the team that we've gathered of individuals on staff here, are going to help get Judge Gorsuch through the nomination process.  And I would say, just as a side note, that if you look at the amazing job that has been done by the team during the transition and now to get these amazing individuals through the process, despite all of the hype that continues to go about this individual is going to face this problem, or which is the one person -- each of them have really sailed through this process.  And story after story says Democrats have tried to land a -- take them out and couldn’t land a glove.  They're unbelievably qualified.  They're unbelievably prepared.  And I think that the same process that we followed with this is going to be followed with Judge Gorsuch, and I think we're going to have a very speedy --\nQ    As a follow-up -- as an unbiased Rhode Island native, can you offer your Super Bowl pick?  And President Trump has also showed quite an affinity for Tom Brady and --\nMR. SPICER:  I will.  I think you know where I come down on that one.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Senators Murkowski and Collins both say they're going to vote \"no\" on Betsy DeVos's nomination.  That leaves zero votes to spare.  And Vice President Pence would have to cast the tie-breaking vote.  So my questions are, how confident are you that you have all of the other Republican senators locked down?  And what's the level of concern in the White House that her nomination is going to fail?\nMR. SPICER:  Zero.  I am 100 percent confident she will be the next Secretary of Education.  She is an unbelievably qualified educator and advocate for students, teachers, parents.  I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad.  She is someone who's been a tireless advocate over the last couple decades to really support reforms that benefit children.  And they are going to be the real winners with her as the Secretary of Education.\nSarah Murray.\nQ    In terms of both the two Republican senators who are voting no on Betsy DeVos and the outcry we saw from Republicans on the Hill last week -- earlier this week about how you guys dealt with the travel ban.  First, is there more that the Trump administration and Trump himself should be doing to ensure that his party is on the same page with his priorities?  And secondly, on the Yemen raid, can you give us more of an understanding of was there a discussion about the risks involved in this?  Was it a straightforward decision?  And do you guys still view it to be a success in spite of the death of a Navy SEAL?\nMR. SPICER:  So first, I would just note, Sarah, that I've heard story after story in the last 40 days about how whether -- going back to the last question about these nominees and not getting through.  Rex Tillerson was going to go down and so-and-so was going to -- and every one of them, after they got to meet with senators of both sides of the party, have shown why the President chose them -- because they were unbelievably qualified, unbelievably ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the area of responsibility that they're taking over.  And I think the same is going to be true for everyone else who is remaining.\nQ    But two members of your own party disagree.\nMR. SPICER:  The vote hasn't taken place.  I think we've had some concerns in the past and I think when these nominees have met with them and shared with them their thoughts throughout the process -- and, again, you can go back, story after story, and again, each one of these folks who I've heard isn't going to make it, is going to go over the finish line each time.  And I think that -- we hear it over and over again and yet we succeed every time.  And yet, another roadblock is put up -- well, this person won't succeed.  And yet, you look at each one of these people going through the process and it's worked beautifully every time.  And I think we're going to continue that path.\nWith respect to Yemen, I think it's hard to ever say something was successful when you lose a life.  But you've got to understand that Chief Owens -- he went back, deployed 12 times, because he loved this country and he believed in the mission.  And knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil is something that I think most servicemembers understand that that's why they join the service.\nAnd so you never want to call something a success, 100 percent, when someone is hurt or killed, and that was the case here, but I think that when you recognize that an individual like this loved this country so much and deployed over and over again because he knew that the mission that he was conducting was so important to our protection, our freedom, our safety.  And I know that when the President spoke to Karen, his wife, and talked about the three children that he left behind, she continued to be impressed with -- to impress upon the President, rather, that while it was an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and her family, that he loved doing this.\nAnd so, again, I don't think you ever call anything 100 percent success, but what he did for this nation and what we got out of that mission, I think I truly believe -- and I know the President believes -- it's going to save American lives.\nWith that, let me go to the last question on Skype and then we'll continue.  Jeff Jobe of South Central Kentucky -- of the Jeff Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky.\nJeff.\nQ    Thank you for allowing me to be part of today's White House press briefing.  Clearly, anyone paying attention will see that President Trump is aggressively acting on his campaign promises.  This in itself gives hope to my state and particularly the region in which I grew up, Appalachia.  We've seen countless politicians make promises at both state and national levels, and not only forget us, but to turn on us.  So my question is, how soon or when will the roles restricting coal mining, coal burning and coal exports be reversed?\nMR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jeff.  I've talked about this a couple times so far, but I believe -- or the President has very clearly stated that clean coal in particular is an issue that's so important to our energy independence as well as our job creation in this country.  And so whether you're talking about Kentucky or West Virginia or Pennsylvania, or so many other places in this country that rely on coal, bringing the production of clean coal back is good for our energy independence, is good for our economy, is good for job creation, and is something that he continues to talk about.  And I think once we have the Secretary of Energy confirmed, that we can continue to take steps to move forward with.\nQ    Two questions for you.  After the primetime announcement last night, it seems like the numbers were good.  Do you have a sense that this President will be more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking primetime air play for his announcements?  And two, top Democrats are asking the Defense Department to investigate Michael Flynn's possible violation of the Constitution.  Do you have a -- it sounds like you saw that story.  Do you have a response to that?\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think on the air time issue, that's something that we're not particularly suffering from when it comes to attention.  And I think the President does a phenomenal job of getting attention and getting his message out.  His use of social media in particular that when you look at the number of people -- I think we had something like 11 million people watching the address on Facebook Live last night.  Obviously if we have important issues to discuss with the nation, or announcements to make or nominations, then we'll request time.  I don’t think that that's something that we've spent a ton of time figuring out.  I think we're doing pretty well on that front.\nAnd then, I'm sorry, the second question, Mike?\nQ    The request from Democrats to investigate Flynn for a possible violation of the Emoluments Clause.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah, so General Flynn, like I think probably countless, if not hundreds, of retired flag officers joins his speaking bureau, and has given speeches at various places.  And I think that is something that is kept in practice.  And the Department of Defense is the appropriate place for them to review it.  But as I said, I think that when you look at so many countless retired flag officers, that's something that generally keeps (inaudible).\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  General Flynn, when he was up here, offered some criticism about the Obama administration's handling of Iran in particular.  Is that something we should be expecting to hear more from this administration, whether it be on foreign policy or other issues -- criticism of the previous administration going forward?\nMR. SPICER:  I think in area where there's going to be a sharp difference, in particular national security, in contrasting the policies that this President is seeking to make the country safer, stronger, more prosperous, he's going to draw those distinctions and contrast out.  But in this particular area, I think the President, when it came to the Iran nuclear deal, was very, very adamant in his opposition to the deal and to its implications.\nAnd so he's going to continue to make sure that the American people know that some of these deals and things that were left by the previous administration, that he wants to make very clear what his position is and his opposition to them.  And the action and the notice that he put Iran on today is something that is important, because I think the American people voted on change.  Again, this is another issue that he was very clear about.\nSo with that, thank you, guys.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Take care.  Have a good day.\nEND\n2:32 P.M.

EST\nGood afternoon.  I know you’re all looking forward to what promises to be a historic night for the nation and for this President.  The President is very excited to make his announcement of the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court later this evening.\nAccording to some polls -- and you know we love polls around here -- for 70 percent of the voters, the President's choice for Supreme Court was an important factor in their choice at the ballot box in November.  For more than one in five, it was the most important factor.  Tonight, he will formally present his nominee to the American people, and I can assure you that this individual will make those voters and every American very, very proud.\nThis particular choice is one that the President takes very seriously.  He knows it will impact the course of our country’s jurisprudence for generations to come.  As such, he's taken careful steps to ensure that this process has both been transparent and inclusive.  He has been speaking about the list of individuals that he may nominate since May of this year, and, after consulting with several influential groups, released a definitive list of 21 in September, pledging that his nominee will solely come from that list.  He sought the advice and consent of both Republicans and Democrats, senators throughout this process.\nThe President recognizes the gravity of his choice to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia, one of the most steadfast protectors of our liberty and devotees of our Constitution that ever graced the bench.  Whomever the President selects will be a worthy successor to the brilliant legal mind and constitutional dedication of Justice Scalia.\nIt's our intention to start promptly tonight in the East Room at 8:02 p.m.  Pre-set will begin at 6:30.  The East Room will be available for live shots approximately 20 minutes following the announcement, and both the Briefing Room and Pebble Beach outside have extended hours tonight to accommodate any additional journalistic needs.  We'll have further guidance on tonight’s plans as the day evolves.\nMoving to the news of the day, I know that Secretary Kelly, alongside other DHS officials, just recently concluded a briefing on the operational implementation of the President’s executive order.  I think it’s pretty clear from the Secretary’s press conference that this executive order was enacted with the proper preparation and coordination between the White House and DHS, and that implementation will continue and proceed as planned.\nWe also have a few updates on the leadership of some of our most critical government agencies.  Last night, as you know, the President relieved Sally Yates of her duties as acting Attorney General and named Dana Boente, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as the acting Attorney General until Democratic senators finally quit their obstruction and confirm the unquestionably qualified Senator Jeff Sessions as our next Attorney General.\nMs. Yates failed to enforce a legal order, approved by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and designed to protect the citizens of the United States.  Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven nations is not extreme.  It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\nAround 9:00 p.m. last night, the President signed an affidavit of nomination for Mr. Boente.  As one of his first official actions in his new post as acting Attorney General, he signed a memorandum rescinding Sally Yates’ guidance regarding the President’s executive order to ensure its full implementation.\nLast night, the President also announced the appointment of Thomas Homan as Acting Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Director of ICE.  Mr. Homan has had a long career at ICE, most recently serving as the Executive Associate Director for Enforcement and Removal Operations.  Having a professional in place like this go serve as the acting director is critical to ensuring the efficient administration of the President’s agenda.\nOne other update on a story from yesterday. I hope you all saw the statement that was put out from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Chairman Dunford noted -- discussed the reorganization of the National Security Council.  And he made it clear that he continues to fully participate in the interagency process and provide the best possible military advice to the President and members of the NSC.  I really hope that that statement closes the book on the misleading narrative, and this should hopefully be the final time that we have to address what was in the national security directive.\nThe family of the President -- excuse me, the President also had a very somber and lengthy conversation with the family of [Navy] Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens.  The President offered his sincerest condolences to Officer Owens’s wife, his father, and their three children.  Chief Owens was on his 12th deployment, from what I understand.  We could never repay the debt of gratitude we owe him, the freedom that he fought for, and the sacrifice that he made, as well as the other members of his unit who were injured in this operation.\nToday in the Senate, two of the President’s nominees advanced out of the committee.  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of both Congressman Ryan Zinke as the next Interior Secretary and the nomination of former Texas Governor Rick Perry as the next Secretary of Energy.  Elaine Chao also gratefully received the approval of the full Senate to become the next Secretary of Transportation.  I expect further guidance on her official swearing-in to come very soon.\nThe Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the President continues to take decisive action, just like he promised.  So it's unfortunate that Senate Democrats remain so out of touch with the message that the American people sent this past November -- that people want change.  President Trump is delivering that change, and the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government.\nI know that I’ve repeated this every day, but honestly it’s getting a bit ridiculous.  The idea that these highly qualified nominees have the votes for their nominations to be endorsed out of committee and get a full vote are being stalled because Democrats are boycotting the committee vote is outrageous.  The mere idea that they're not even showing up to hearings is truly outrageous.  So I'd like to give a special shout-out to the folks at C-SPAN for making sure that all of these embarrassing actions by Senate Democrats get the wall-to-wall coverage that they deserve.  Voters are going to remember what senators stood in the way of when President Trump -- by President Trump trying to install his agency and department leaders the next time their name is on a ballot.\nI don’t mean to sound like a broken record, but the numbers don’t lie.  Sixteen of President Trump’s nominees to head major department or agencies are still waiting to be confirmed.  At the same time in 2009, President Obama only had seven of these people awaiting confirmation.  In 2001, President Bush had all but two.\nMoving on, here at the White House, this morning, we reiterated the President’s intention to continue to enforce the executive order protecting employees from the anti-LGBTQ discrimination while working for the federal government or contractors.\nAlso this morning, the President had a breakfast and listening session with major pharmaceutical company executives in the Roosevelt Room:  Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene, Amgen, Eli Lilly, and the PhRMA trade group were represented at the meeting.  Chairman Greg Walden, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, also participated.  During the meeting, the President commended their progress in lowering drugs prices but also reiterated his insistence that there is more work to be done.  He promised to continue reducing the burdensome regulations that raise the cost of doing business in America.\nHe was pleased to hear that the Chairman of Amgen, Robert Bradway, discussed how 1,600 American jobs will be added by Amgen.  This administration will continue to prioritize jobs and make it easier for businesses around this country to hire more Americans.\nThe President had lunch with Mayor Giuliani just a short time ago, who serves as the CEO of an international security firm, Giuliani Partners, and was tapped by the President to lend his expertise to the administration's cyber efforts.  Mayor Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his 15 years private sector security, providing solutions for the challenges that we face in the cyber world.\nDuring the transition, the President announced that he intended to host a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies that are facing challenges, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information from technological infrastructures.  These are the same challenges facing the government that are facing public entities and businesses, and the President believes that solutions to these issues will often come from the private sector.\nFollowing the lunch with Mayor Giuliani, the President will host a listening session with these cybersecurity experts and Mayor Giuliani.  No consensus or advice on the recommendations resulting from the group are wildly expected, but we do expect a spirited and wide-ranging discussion regarding the growing cybersecurity threats that our nation is facing.\nLater this afternoon, the President will sign an executive order -- or potentially sign one -- the federal government cybersecurity efforts, and give leaders the tools they need to keep the country safe from cyberattacks.\nThe order does three main things:  It secures the federal networks we operate on behalf of the American people.  It will work with industry to protect critical infrastructure and maintain our way of life.  And it will advance the cause of Internet freedom.\nMore information will be available later this afternoon, but the executive order is the first step in the President taking to address the new security challenges of the 21st century.\nThe Vice President today participated in the Republican Policy lunch today in the Senate.  He'll hold several meetings with members on Capitol Hill, the beginning of extensive outreach by our Legislative Affairs team on the President’s Supreme Court choice.\nTonight, the Vice President will swear in Elaine Chao, as I mentioned.  We'll have further updates.  We expect it to be at 5 o'clock in the ceremonial office across the way, in the Old Executive Office Building.\nSecretary Chao is one of the most successful Cabinet officials in American history, having been the longest tenured Secretary of Labor since WWII, and also serving as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under George H.W. Bush’s administration.  She's the perfect choice to lead the Department of Transportation into what promises to be a significant period of modernization and improvement.\nAs I already mentioned, the last thing on our schedule for tonight is the President's announcement of the next Associate Justice for the Supreme Court.\nTomorrow is the kick-off for Black History Month, and the White House is excited to host a series of events this month in recognition of it.  In particular, the U.S. Post Office will hold a ceremony tomorrow celebrating the official issuance of the Dorothy Height Forever stamp.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and is a true pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement.\nFinally, a couple administrative notes.  On Friday, the President will depart from this White House to the \"Winter White House” down at Mar-A-Lago, where he’ll spend the weekend and be holding meetings.  Further guidance on both trips will be coming out throughout the week.\nAnd I’m excited to announce that following up on our announcement of expanding the press briefing room to Skype seats, we’ll officially be launching the briefing room tomorrow.  The inaugural panelists will be Natalie Herbick, from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio; Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show; Jeff Jobe, from Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky; and Kimberly Kalunian, from WPRI in Rhode Island.  Not sure how she snuck in there.  (Laughter.)\nI look forward to virtually welcoming them to the briefing room.  And with that, some questions.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ    The removal last night of Ms. Yates from her position has raised questions as to how this President will deal with dissent in the ranks currently and in the future.  Does he see what she said yesterday as a difference of opinion, an active insubordination?  How would he read it?  And how will he act on similar things in the future?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, there’s a big difference, John, between listening and sharing ideas, and executing lawful orders.  It is the right of every American to express their idea and opinion, and, frankly, that’s what you’ve seen the President do today.  We’re talking about leaving -- at 2 o'clock hour, him sitting down with cyber experts to get their opinions and ideas on how to protect our critical infrastructures.\nBut there’s a difference.  When she, as the Acting Attorney General, is not only responsible but required to execute lawful orders and defiantly says \"no,\" as someone who was chosen to lead a department, she was rightfully removed.  That is a position of leadership that is given to somebody who is supposed to execute orders that are handed down to them properly, of which that executive order was 100 percent done.\nIronically, it went through their office’s -- the Department of Justice Office of Legal Compliance.  So the idea that it went through the entire process of which they were part of, and then she chooses not to execute it, actually is bewildering as well as defiant.\nQ    So is the President -- so, sorry, can I just follow up on that?  So is the President laying down a marker now to all of his Cabinet secretaries and all of his other officials to say, if I give you a directive and you do not follow it, you’re gone?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that that kind of comes with the job, right?  If you don’t believe in the President’s agenda -- and I think every one of the Cabinet members, every one of the appointees understands that they serve at the pleasure of the President.  We talked about this at length during the transition.  This isn’t about joining the government to execute your ideas or your initiatives.  The President was very clear during the campaign, whether it was economic security or national security, that he has an agenda that he articulated very, very clearly to the American people, and that --\nQ    But --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  Thank you.  And that it is his job to lay that vision out, and that the people that he appoints and nominates and announces as staff members or Cabinet-level members or agency heads, their job is to fulfill that.  And if they don’t like it, then they shouldn’t take the job.  But it is the President’s agenda that we are fulfilling here.\nTrey.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  As it relates to the executive order today, how will the Trump administration ensure the digital privacy of all Americans as the President looks to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, look, just to be clear on the executive order, I think one of the things that the President -- the reason the President wants Mayor Giuliani and some of these cyber experts to come in is to get their ideas, to make sure that where we’re headed in cybersecurity is fulfilling the intent that ensures that our critical infrastructures throughout the government and, frankly, throughout business -- to the extent that the government can be helpful in that -- are protected and secured.\nSo I just want to caution what we may or may not do today.  I think the President has got a pretty good idea of where he’s going to go, but I think he wants to hear what Mayor Giuliani and some of these other experts have to say about the steps that we can take in terms of executive action that will help secure further these critical infrastructures.\nApril.\nQ    Sean, I have a couple of questions.  I want to go back to the issue of this travel ban.\nMR. SPICER:  Well, first of all, it’s not a travel ban.  I think you heard Secretary Kelly -- I apologize, I just want to make sure I get this straight.  I think Secretary Kelly or one of the other individuals that got up there from DHS mentioned I think a million people have now come into this country.  That’s not a ban.\nWhat it is, is to make sure that the people who are coming in are vetted properly from seven countries that were identified by the Obama administration.  A ban would mean people can’t get in.  We’ve clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries.  Sorry.  Go ahead.\nQ    Okay.  But mind you, I have two questions.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER:  I know, of course.\nQ    So with all of this happening, and as you’re trying to give specifics about what’s happening, what is the concern about the fallout from other countries who are viewing this still in a certain way?  Have you looked at the fallout and how to counter it, and how to work with these other countries that may be allies, or even may not be allies, in order to prevent something from happening?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think, April, one of the things that we’re doing is trying to make sure that people understand what actually happened.  I saw reporting today that Secretary Kelly was out of the loop and he was on a plane and flying, and then it was reported on one of the networks and major institutions about what happened.  And Secretary Kelly comes out and says, I was briefed on this time, I was talked on this time, the edits came from my staff.  I don’t know how -- I don’t want to spend each of these briefings talking about misinformation, but at the end of the day, a major newspaper and a major network reported today that they were kept out of the loop.  The Secretary detailed multiple occasions in which he was briefed on it.  His staff made edits to it.\nI don’t know how much more -- and so I think part of what we’re trying to do is make sure that people actually understand what happened, what the process was, and what the order actually does.  Because when we use words like “travel ban,” that misrepresents what it is.  It’s seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration where, frankly, we don’t get the information that we need for people coming into this country.\nBecause what this isn’t about is not just the people.  It’s about the information that another country provides us.  So we work with other countries, and we have systems in place to ensure that when you travel from our country to their -- or from their country to our country or vice versa, that we are sharing information about passengers and citizens that are going in and out.\nThese seven countries in particular, we don’t have the information that is necessarily required to make an accurate determination at the time of entry into our country.  So we are going to make sure that because that country doesn’t have maybe either the systems in place or, in some cases, the willingness to provide us the information necessary to ensure that the people that are coming into this country are properly vetted.\nThis isn’t about refugees, it’s about travelers.  And that’s what this is about.\nAnd so part of what we’re doing is, frankly, making sure that other countries understand exactly what was in the order, how it, how it applies, what it means to visas and waivers and all this kind of stuff.  But for the most part, you've seen a lot of panic, and the people actually stopping, reading the order, and realizing, \"oh, that's it?\"\nAnd I think that's what we've tried to make sure that people have the facts.\nQ    So you're doing outreach for that?\nMR. SPICER:  We're doing -- we're not just doing outreach.  I think we're doing as many briefings -- Secretary Kelly going out there a little while ago with the head of both ICE and CBP is trying to make sure that people understand that the process is working correctly -- it’s working very well -- that the government is doing what it’s supposed to, to protect its people.  And that's the number one thing that we can do.\nYeah.\nQ    One other -- you said, two.\nMR. SPICER:  I’m sorry.  You're right.\nQ    Now, the President met with the pharmaceutical heads.\nMR. SPICER:  Yeah.\nQ    When is this meeting scheduled for Congressman Elijah Cummings and President Trump, after that call that President Trump made --\nMR. SPICER:  Right.  My understanding is that Congressman Cummings was -- he was invited to this meeting.  He had a scheduling conflict, and we're looking at setting it back up.  But he was invited to the meeting today.  He informed us he had a scheduling conflict.  And we're looking to get it back on the books as soon as we can.\nQ    Would it be one on one?  Not --\nMR. SPICER:  I expect at this point it will be one on one.\nQ    Thanks, a lot, Sean.  Does the President anticipate a difficult confirmation fight for his nominee, whoever that is?\nMR. SPICER:  No.  I think we've proven so far that the Democrats can try to obstruct, but at the end of the day, the will of the American people is going to overcome that.\nAnd again, what I mentioned at the outset of this is the advice and consent piece of this.  He and our team have met with senators from both sides of the aisle to make sure that we understand the qualities that they are looking for in the next associate justice.  And I think that we have done a very, very good job of getting a nominee in place that will be announced tonight that meets the criteria that they set forth.  They may not like their political or philosophical background, but I think the criteria in terms of academia background, time on the bench, the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both Republicans and Democrats.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Do you believe you can get nine Democrats to support this nominee?\nMR. SPICER:  I do.  Absolutely.  Because I think at the end of the day, one of the things that's been a time-honored tradition in this country is that we recognize that the confirmation process is -- the default is that if you're qualified for the position, then you should be confirmed.  Not the other around.\nAnd I think that most Democrats realize that at some point that is -- having a court that is not fully operational is not the political fight to have.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ    Sean, let me ask you the obvious follow-up question then.  At least one Republican senator has said Democrats have removed the filibuster from just about every other appointment, aside from the Supreme Court.  And he said several Republicans say they would have no hesitation about moving for another nuclear option if Democrats attempt a filibuster of any of the possible nominees.  Is this something the President would support?  And has he discussed it with members of the Senate?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think first and foremost taking a step to the last question, I think we're going to get the nine senators regardless, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we get more.  When you look -- and I’ll be able to shed more light on this tomorrow in terms of the background.  But I think that he is -- we've got an individual that I think is hopefully going to garner widespread bipartisan support because I think this individual has the qualifications and the experience and the judicial philosophy that should win bipartisan support.\nThat being said, beyond that, I would suggest that that's -- Senator McConnell has done a phenomenal job of moving things along in the Senate to the extent that Democrats will let him.  And I'll leave any further questions on how the Senate operates to him.\nBlake.\nQ    Sean, thanks.  We know that the list of 21 was put out during the campaign.  We know that, at 8:02 tonight, the President is going to reveal his selection.  Can you kind of fill the gap in between as to how often the President might have spoken with this person, whether there were any meetings here at the White House, just any of the -- how he got there?  And then the last hours -- (laughter) -- or in the last days here, really, who has he leaned on to kind of narrow this down?  And then a follow-up, if you don’t mind.\nMR. SPICER:  I will say, I think I can probably shed a lot more light on this tomorrow.  I appreciate the effort to try to head that off.  Tomorrow I think we might be able to have a little bit more of a discussion as to how the President came to this choice.  He may touch on it a little tonight; I'll leave it to him.  But I appreciate that.\nQ    Let me ask you about the news of the day.  Prescription drug prices -- the President met with the pharma leaders earlier today.  What makes him so confident that he can drive down drug prices, whereas administrations past have tried to do the same but haven't been able to?  How is he going to go about it?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think it's the story of his entire administration.  He's a successful businessman and a top-notch negotiator.  Several people tried to get the cost of planes down, the cost of the F-35 and the cost of the Air Force One.  And through a couple of conversations, he did it -- shaved billions off of the cost of both -- excuse me, off the F-35 and significant off the next generation of Air Force One.\nI think he has a track record so far just during the transition, but also as a businessman -- he knows how to negotiate.  And I think he is going to sit down with these individuals the same way that he's getting people to understand the agenda and the regulatory and tax climate that he wants to institute that's bringing jobs home.  People are making a commitment to him to bring jobs and manufacturing back based on his track record as a businessman and his word.  They understand that he's going to create a climate that supports the American worker and American manufacturing.\nSo I think -- you look over and over again, the number of companies that want to come back and say, we want to be part of this agenda to grow the economy and to create jobs or to help you fight on behalf of taxpayers, and I think you're going to continue to see that.\nHe understands the challenges that the bureaucracy that's holding back some of the negotiating, that's allowing these prescription drug prices to drop or get the best deal for the government in cases whether it's Medicare or Medicaid, who are such large buyers of the VA -- that you're not -- you have got such purchasing power that's not being utilized to the full extent.\nHunter Walker.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  The President is meeting with Mayor Giuliani today.  What do you think of the mayor's claim that the executive order on those seven countries evolved from the Muslim ban that the President proposed during the campaign?  Is that accurate?\nMR. SPICER:  I think the President has talked about extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe for a very, very long time.  At the same time, he's also made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban.  It's not a travel ban.  It's a vetting system to keep America safe -- that's it, plain and simple.  And all of the facts and a reading of it clearly show that that's what it is.\nQ    Mayor Giuliani stressed that too, but he said that it came out of the desire to have a Muslim ban.\nMR. SPICER:  Then you should ask Mayor Giuliani.  That's his opinion.  I'm just telling you what the President has said and what the President has done has been to focus on making sure that we keep the country safe and that the executive order that was drafted does just that -- is to make sure and to ensure that people coming in from seven countries, identified by the Obama administration, that we didn't have the proper systems to know who was coming into our country was put in place, and a 90-day period was also granted to ensure that we knew how to further address vetting situations in the future.\nZeke.\nQ    Thanks, Sean.  Just following up again about the strike over the weekend in Yemen.  Can you confirm that the eight-year-old -- the reports that the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in that strike?  And if you can address sort of the killing of the American citizen in this anti-terrorism operation.\nMR. SPICER:  I'm not going to go any further than what the Department of Defense has released.  Obviously, we recovered a tremendous amount of information, and we killed an estimated 14 members of al Qaeda in -- AQAP individuals.  And then we suffered the loss of life of a servicemember, and four people were injured.  That's as far as I'm willing to go at this time.\nKristen.\nQ    Sean, thanks.  You're saying it's not a ban.  This was President Trump's tweet yesterday:  \"If the ban were announced with a one-week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week.\"  So he says it's a ban.\nMR. SPICER:  He's using the words that the media is using.  But at the end of the day, it can't --\nQ    Those are his words.\nQ    Wait a minute.\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  It can't be --\nQ    That's his words, his tweet.\nMR. SPICER:  Jonathan, thanks, I'll let Kristen talk.  It can't be a ban if you're letting a million people in.  If 325,000 people from another country can't come in, that is by nature not a ban -- it is extreme vetting.\nQ    I understand your point.  But the President himself called it a ban.\nMR. SPICER:  I understand that.\nQ    Is he confused or are you confused?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I'm not confused.  I think that the words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this.  He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting.\nQ    It seems to fit into this broader point, Sean, which Paul Ryan said today:  \"I think it's regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this.\"  The House Speaker saying that.  What do you say to Republicans who argue that this is a part of a broader issue with the President not enacting this policy smoothly?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, first of all, I think we've addressed that -- that we could have either telegraphed this days in advance, in which people could have gotten on planes and come over here, which would have undermined the exact nature of what this sought to prevent.  Or we could have done it in a way that inconvenienced some folks for a little while --\nQ    But do you dispute that there was confusion --\nMR. SPICER:  Can I answer the -- no, no, I do -- there’s clearly some confusion.  But I think part of it, your network was one of the people that just hours ago told people that General Kelly was unaware of what’s going on.  And then moments later he gets on air saying, here’s how many times I got briefed.  So, I mean, with all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion.  You have helped cause this, despite claims that whatever.  You claim that you have sources that tell us.  General Kelly stands up and says, this is how many times I’ve been briefed, this is how many people were involved.  And yet you were out there for --\nQ    I think there was a New York Times report that was cited --\nMR. SPICER:  Oh, okay, so I apologize if NBC News’s reporting is based on The New York Times’s false reporting.\nQ    It was accurate reporting, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  How can it be accurate reporting, Glenn, if --\nQ    Both things can be true.\nQ    It was accurate reporting, Sean.\nMR. SPICER:  Okay, so the --\nQ    They can be true that he --\nMR. SPICER:  The Secretary of Homeland Security just stood up, and so you're calling him a liar?\nQ    He didn't say he saw the specifics of the --\nMR. SPICER:  Jonathan, I’m talking to Glenn.  I’m talking to Glenn.\nQ    No one is calling anyone a liar.  I’m saying we --\nMR. SPICER:  You said that the report in the New York Times said that he was unaware of the ban.\nQ    Sean, let me ask you a question.\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  No, no, answer the question.  Because you just called this --\nQ    So a couple of minutes ago you stood at the podium and you reiterated something you said yesterday about anyone who doesn't agree in terms of career bureaucracy should hit the road.  I’m paraphrasing.  You had a statement that President Trump made where he accused the acting Attorney General of “betraying” her own department by expressing a counter opinion.  Don't you think that kind of language has a chilling effect on the public statements that your officials make?\nMR. SPICER:  No, I think there’s a big difference.  Think about the process that worked it here.  The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Compliance vetted the executive order, sent it back to us saying it was completely compliant.  Then the acting Attorney General goes out and says, I’m not going to enforce it.  You tell me how that jives.  Because at the end of the day, if the action Attorney General has an office under her jurisdiction that says that something is legal and compliant, and then she gets out there and says, I’m not going to enforce it, that doesn't sound like an Attorney General that is upholding the duty that she swore to uphold.\nQ    Well, if she think it's illegal --\nMR. SPICER:  At the end of the day -- then she should step down.  But at the end of the day, the Attorney General either had a problem with her own division approving something.  But it wasn’t the President she had a problem with.  The President followed the process, sought feedback, went through the inter-agency review, had other departments sign off, despite the reporting that said it was otherwise.\nQ    But is this a betrayal, though?\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  Guys --\nQ    Is it a betrayal?\nMR. SPICER:  David.\nQ    That's a very hard word.\nMR. SPICER:  Why don't we just let me answer Glenn so we can be polite now, huh?\nAnd what the answer is, is that we went through the process.  The Office of Legal Compliance came back and said, this is a compliant executive order, it’s fully legal, and it can be executed.\nSo then for the Attorney General to turn around and say, I’m not going to uphold this lawful executive order is clearly a dereliction of duty.  And she should have been removed, and she was.  I just -- it is odd to me that we're having a discussion about somebody whose job it is to execute lawful orders who chose not to do it -- hold on -- who chose not to do it, and then we're questioning whether or not we were right to remove her.  That's the right thing to do.\nAnd if you looked at the folks from the right and the left, constitutional scholars this morning -- they said, we might not agree with some of the policies or the political -- or the party of the President, but he was right to do this.  He had every right --\nQ    So why use the word “betrayal” --\nMR. SPICER:  Because the department’s job is to execute.  They're the Department of Justice.  And if you have a legally executed order and the Attorney General says, I’m not going to execute it, that truly -- that clearly is a betrayal of what she’s --\nQ    Let’s define the word \"betrayal.\"\nMR. SPICER:  I’m not going to define the word, Glenn.\nYes.\nQ    Sean, I think the New York Times report said that the Secretary did not receive a full briefing until the executive order was being signed.  So my question is, can we expect that secretaries, agency heads, when there are future executive orders or changes of policy, may not receive full briefings before --\nMR. SPICER:  Look, the Secretary was briefed on multiple occasions with the language of the order.  I don't know how you can say this any other way.\nQ    Well, I'm just talking about a full briefing, which is what the New York Times reported.\nMR. SPICER:  And I’m telling you that I don't believe the New York Times reporting is accurate.  What I’m telling you is that the Secretary on multiple occasions was briefed, his senior officials were briefed -- not just briefed; they were part of the drafting process.  It went through -- not only that.  Just back up.  So they get consulted and briefed.  It goes through the Office of Legal Compliance.  Then it gets shipped out to the NSC and the Homeland Security Council.  This went through a very, very extensive staffing process.\nSo the idea that you can talk whether or not he got fully briefed or -- he was briefed multiple times, saw the language.  His staff made edits.  It came back multiple times.  I’m not sure how much more briefing you can do.\nQ    Thank you, Sean.  Zoe Daniel, from Australian Broadcasting.  Thanks for taking the question.  The Australian government made a recent deal with the Obama administration whereby the U.S. would take refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centers.  Now most of these people are from Iran, but also some are from Iraq and Somalia, among other places.  Can you confirm that this deal is still on?  Are those refugees exempt from what you describe as the extreme vetting?  Or will that deal change or be delayed?\nMR. SPICER:  So the deal specifically deals with 1,250 people.  They're mostly in Papua New Guinea, being held.  Those people -- part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we're doing now.  There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them.  That is part and parcel of the deal that was made.  And it was made by the Obama administration with the full backing of the United States government.\nThe President, in accordance with that deal to honor what had been agreed upon by the United States government, and in ensuring that that vetting will take place in the same manner that we're doing it now, will go forward.\nYes.\nQ    The big question -- looking at the bigger picture -- this President, when he came in, said he was going to gather us all together, that he was going to bring us together.  And the actions taken in the first 10 days seem to indicate otherwise from people in his own party -- the use of the word “betrayal.” How is this President going to address the fact that people are looking to him to bring people together, and yet with his own words seems to be driving us apart?\nMR. SPICER:  I think that's a very one-sided way of looking at this.  I think he’s brought --\nQ    Elaborate.\nMR. SPICER:  I will.  I think he’s brought unions together, business leaders together, Republicans, Democrats, independents.  I think someone who doesn't carry out an act and using that as a way to describe that he’s not bringing the country together is not exactly a representation.\nQ    I have one quick follow-up.\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.  I don't -- I’m not -- the President has done a tremendous amount through both what he has said and done, more importantly, to start to bring this country together.  And his policies, frankly, are focused on keeping every American safe and getting every American a higher-paying and better-paying job.  I think that is something that benefits all of us.\nQ    The follow-up -- I asked you about a shield law for journalists last week.  You said you would get with this?\nQ    If I could just --\nMR. SPICER:  Hold on.\nQ    -- ask real quick on trade.  Now that notices have been given to the TPP countries, are you considering any changes in the roles of your three sort of official trade negotiators?  And what area of the globe are you going to start first on negotiations?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, there's no change in their roles.  I'm not entirely sure. I think they -- as announced --\nQ    (Inaudible) negotiator --\nMR. SPICER:  He is the U.S. -- I mean, he's got to be confirmed first, but the U.S. trade representative is clearly the leader of negotiating trade deals.  Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro and Jason Greenblatt -- there's a great, unbelievably robust, brilliant team that has continued to work on behalf of deals and renegotiating, looking at them.  So it's a two-step process.\nI think, number one, we're going to reexamine all of the current trade deals, figure out if we can re-improve them.  But secondly, I think we're going to start talking to other countries around the globe, including some of those TPP partners.  I think of the 11 other countries, five of them we have current trade deals with.  So you would examine those to see if we can improve upon them and then look at the other countries in there and see if there's a willingness to engage with some of those other countries.\nQ    Sean, the President has previously indicated that he would encourage the targeting of families of terror suspects.  Is that still his current position?\nMR. SPICER:  When did he say that?\nQ    December 3rd, on Fox.  He said, \"The other thing with [the] terrorists is you have to take out their families.\"  Is that still his position?\nMR. SPICER:  I think he's been very clear that when it comes to seeking out ISIS and other terrorists, that he's going to lean on Director Pompeo, General Mattis, and seek their opinion on stuff.  And I think that will be continued.\nSarah.\nQ    Even the families of terror suspects, civilian members of families, Sean?\nMR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Rebecca.\nQ    On Guantanamo, Sean.  Thanks for taking this question.  I know that you've indicated at that podium that there will be further action.  What does this look like?  And there are five detainees that have been cleared for transfer that are sitting at Guantanamo.  Would this administration take action in the next coming months on those detainees?\nMR. SPICER:  I think all of those actions are being currently reviewed, and we don't have anything further at this time.\nQ    The Obama administration's endangerment finding undergirds the Clean Power Plan.  Does the President still plan to revoke the Clean Power Plan?  And would he perhaps even go further and try and revoke the endangerment finding?\nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President has made very clear with respect to energy policy that he wants to review all of the options that we have to use our natural resources to better the country in terms of wind power, solar, clean coal.  We're in the process of reviewing all of our energy policies.  I'd go back to note that we don't have an Energy Secretary confirmed right now because the Senate hasn't yet moved forward with that.  I hope that once that's done, we will have further updates on energy.\nMatt.\nQ    Sean, Sally Yates was obviously an Obama appointee, was holding it through the transition.  How many more of them are there throughout the government at this time, as the transition and confirmation process plays out?  And do you expect any more problems from any of the other ones?\nMR. SPICER:  In some cases, we’ve held some individuals over because they hold a critical position within government.  In some cases, we’ve named folks as acting.  It’s a case-by-case basis.  And again, I think part of it right now is the President wanted to focus on getting his Cabinet up and complete.  We’ll continue to make nominations both at the deputy, under and assistant secretary-level.\nBut in key agencies -- so, ICE being one of them, where it’s an assistant secretary.  But there are 30 other agencies where we’ve named acting heads to ensure that as we move through the confirmation process, we have somebody in that position to ensure continuity of government.\nDaniel.\nQ    Sean, yesterday you said 109 individuals were affected by this extreme vetting.\nMR. SPICER:  Right.\nQ    DHS officials said that it was over 1,100.\nMR. SPICER:  No, no, no, hold on.  First of all, just to be clear, what they’re talking about is the number of people who weren’t allowed to board a plane coming in.  So they were stopped at their port of entry, had to get additional clearance, and then take off.  There’s a big difference.  The numbers that we’re talking about were the initial group of people that were in transit at the time the executive order was signed.\nAnd then there’s another group of people -- and the Department of Homeland Security has those numbers up to date on their website -- where they’re talking about people that are stopped at the port of entry to ensure that they’re properly vetted before they board a plane.  There’s a very, very delicate distinction between people who were on the plane coming into this country when the executive order was signed, all of who have been vetted and cleared, and the people who have been stopped at a port of entry in one of those seven countries to ensure that the proper vetting took place before they were able to move on.\nQ    Sean, Hallie’s question was about civilians that are being targeted by the administration in anti-terror raids.  And Zeke’s question was about al-Awlaki’s daughter.  So let me ask you:  Is the President willing to kill and target American citizens, even minors, just because their family members are terrorists?\nMR. SPICER:  No American citizen will ever be targeted.\nQ    One more follow-up there.  If you’re qualified for the position -- you said earlier, if you’re qualified for the position, you should get confirmed.  That’s not how Merrick Garland was treated in the previous administration.\nMR. SPICER:  No, there’s never been a situation in which you had a fourth-term -- someone that late in an election cycle.  That had never occurred before.  And I think that the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice, and that’s exactly what happened.\nAs I noted at the beginning of this, 70 percent of people thought that the President’s choice for the next Supreme Court was a major decision.  That was something he campaigned on.  I think when you’re that late in a term -- it had never happened before.  And the goal was to make sure that the voters had a say in allowing that to happen.  And I think that, clearly, it worked.  The voters looked at that as a major reason in which they voted for the President.  And I think that as we move forward, that’s why I think we’re going to get the support we need.\nQ    Sean, if the President does get his pick on the bench, what are any specific cases that the administration hopes that the Court takes up in the near future\nMR. SPICER:  Well, there’s a lot of cases that I think are in the queue right now that have the potential to be 4-4.  I think the idea is to get this individual confirmed as soon as possible just to get the docket moving.  That’s probably the biggest priority right now.\nThank you guys very much.  Have a great day.  I’ll see you tonight.  Good luck.  Eight o'clock.\nEND - 1:50 P.M.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n5:39 P.M. EST\nMR. SPICER:  Good evening.  Thank you guys for coming.  I know our first official press briefing is going to be on Monday, but I wanted to give you a few updates on the President's activities.  But before I get to the news of the day, I think I'd like to discuss a little bit of the coverage of the last 24 hours.\nYesterday, at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and, as the President said, the transition and the balance of power from Washington to the citizens of the United States, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting.  For all the talk about the proper use of Twitter, two instances yesterday stand out.\nOne was a particular egregious example in which a reporter falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office.  After it was pointed out that this was just plain wrong, the reporter casually reported and tweeted out and tried to claim that a Secret Service agent must have just been standing in front of it.  This was irresponsible and reckless.\nSecondly, photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall.  This was the first time in our nation's history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall.  That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.  This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\nInaccurate numbers involving crowd size were also tweeted.  No one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out.  By the way, this applies to any attempts to try to count the number of protestors today in the same fashion.\nWe do know a few things, so let's go through the facts.  We know that from the platform where the President was sworn in, to 4th Street, it holds about 250,000 people.  From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000.  And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people.  All of this space was full when the President took the Oath of Office.  We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural.  This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration -- period -- both in person and around the globe.  Even the New York Times printed a photograph showing a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original Tweet in their paper, which showed the full extent of the support, depth in crowd, and intensity that existed.\nThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.  The President was also at the -- as you know, the President was also at the Central Intelligence Agency and greeted by a raucous overflow crowd of some 400-plus CIA employees.  There were over 1,000 requests to attend, prompting the President to note that he'll have to come back to greet the rest.  The employees were ecstatic that he's the new Commander-in-Chief, and he delivered them a powerful and important message.  He told them he has their back, and they were grateful for that.  They gave him a five-minute standing ovation at the end in a display of their patriotism and their enthusiasm for his presidency.\nI'd also note that it's a shame that the CIA didn’t have a CIA Director to be with him today when he visited, because the Democrats have chosen -- Senate Democrats are stalling the nomination of Mike Pompeo and playing politics with national security.  That's what you guys should be writing and covering, instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives.\nThe President is committed to unifying our country, and that was the focus of his inaugural address.  This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging -- that bringing about our nation together is making it more difficult.\nThere's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable.  And I'm here to tell you that it goes two ways.  We're going to hold the press accountable, as well.  The American people deserve better.  And as long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people where his focus will always be.\nAnd with that, a few other updates from the day.  The President had a constructive conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada about strengthening the relationship between our two nations.  They also discussed setting up additional meetings in the days to come, which we will follow up on.  He also spoke to Prime Minister Peña Nieto of Mexico, and talked about a visit on trade, immigration and security that will occur on the 31st.  The President will welcome his first foreign leader this Thursday when the United Kingdom's Theresa May will come to Washington -- on Friday.\nTomorrow, the President will oversee his Assistants to the President being sworn in.  The staff will then have an ethics briefing, a briefing on the proper use and handling of classified information.  Further updates as far as what he will do -- oh, and then in the evening, he will have a reception for law enforcement and first responders that helped support the inauguration.\nThank you guys for being here tonight.  I will see you on Monday.\nEND\n5:44 P.M.

Trump today congratulated Exxon Mobil Corporation on its ambitious $20 billion investment program that is creating more than 45,000 construction and manufacturing jobs in the United States Gulf Coast region.\nPresident Trump made a promise to bring back jobs to America. The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning.\n“This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,” the President said. “Many of the products that will be manufactured here in the United States by American workers will be exported to other countries, improving our balance of trade. This is a true American success story. In addition, the jobs created are paying on average $100,000 per year.”\nDarren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil announced the company’s investment program during a keynote speech today to an oil and gas industry conference in Houston, Texas.\n“Investments of this scale require a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment and we appreciate the President’s commitment to both,” said Woods. “The energy industry has proven it can operate safely and responsibly. Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administration’s support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment.”\nExxon Mobil is strategically investing in new refining and chemical-manufacturing projects in the United States Gulf Coast region to expand its manufacturing and export capacity. The company’s Growing the Gulf program consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022.\nExxon Mobil’s projects, once completed and operating at mature levels, are expected to have far-reaching and long-lasting benefits. Projects planned or under way are expected to create more than 35,000 construction jobs and more than 12,000 full-time jobs. These are full-time manufacturing jobs that are mostly high-skilled and high-paying, and have annual salaries ranging from $75,000 to $125,000. These jobs will have a multiplier effect, creating many more jobs in the community that service these new investments.", "timestamp": "2017-03-06T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump Congratulates Exxon Mobil for Job-Creating Investment Program"}

It does make one wonder what the Obama Administration did with all the money that we spent on defense over the course of the last eight years, but I will tell you this Maria, in arriving at the $54 billion, there's a couple of different things that got us to that number. First, it was the number that the President promised during the campaign. It's the number that would be for the military, $603 billion if there were no military sequester. That was very specific. The President set out to undo the military sequester, that’s exactly what this does. We sat down with the Defense Department, with the Pentagon, to go over how much money they actually needed to start solving some of these problems. We are not going to undo the damage that has been done in just one year. This is the first step of several years of additional defense spending this President wants to see, but, again, we worked in close lock step with the DOD to arrive at this number. … I’m just saying we managed to do so, and I don’t want to minimize this at [missing word??]. It would be easy to take any number out of the air, but it would inevitably add to the deficit this year. What I don't want to get lost in all of this is the President's commitment to move money within our current budget to prioritize defense. He's doing this $54 billion of additional spending for the military without adding to the already large 2018 budget. That's exactly what he said he would be do and that’s what he’s delivering.”\nCounselor to the President Kellyanne Conway on CBS’ Sunday Morning on the President’s Joint Address: “It is President Trump who was writing and rewriting entire passages, and he really wanted it to be in his voice.”\nNORAH O’DONNELL: “It was called a presidential speech and he's been President for five weeks. What went into this speech that changed the way he's communicating?” KELLYANNE CONWAY: “Well, first of all, I was part of the process -- others did the bulk of the work. But I will tell you that it [was] President Trump who was writing and rewriting entire passages, and he really wanted it to be in his voice.  And he works with [a] brilliant speech writer, Stephen Miller, who is able to really reflect the President's tone and content.

He called for corporate tax reform and export incentives, and he lashed out at Nafta and China for draining America’s manufacturing base.\n…\nAlthough cheap, labor-intensive goods often come to mind when Americans think of job-displacing imports, the more capital- and technology-intensive segments of manufacturing have hardly been immune. Sectors like motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, nonelectrical machinery (like machine tools, farm machinery and power-generating turbines) and industrial chemicals add up to nearly half of manufacturing’s enormous, chronic annual trade deficits nowadays.\n…\nSince then, moreover, trade deficits in advanced manufacturing have worsened, and the stagnation of productivity growth suggests that the robots have been replacing fewer workers. So trade-related job loss in these sectors surely has grown — and smart, pro-domestic manufacturing policies can bring them back.\n…\nThe United States is not only the world’s biggest single national economy, but for all its recent sluggishness, it has also generally been the fastest-growing major economy, and it is the most open to imports. That’s why it’s the single largest export market for a fifth of the world’s countries. That’s why it has remained the world’s largest consumer of foreign goods, despite slashing its previously huge purchases of foreign oil. That’s largely why each percentage point of new American growth lifts global growth by much more than similar expansion in China, and nearly as much as growth in the euro area — which unlike the United States is relatively poor in natural resources and needs to buy many more commodities from overseas. That’s also why nearly all leading countries and groupings — including the eurozone — have long-run trade surpluses with the United States.\nThe United States plays an even more central role in countries that have come into Mr. Trump’s trade crosshairs. Slow-growing Mexico, for example, would be performing much more sluggishly if it were not able to export the equivalent of 28 percent of its annual economic output to the United States. Its auto shipments to America alone are its biggest generator of foreign exchange reserves.\n…\nBut the official manufacturing job and trade statistics make entirely obvious that the rewards to the American economy will be substantial. And as Mr. Trump’s speech on Tuesday made clear, America has a president who understands its ample power to reap them.\nRead the entire article here.", "timestamp": "2017-03-03T00:00:00", "title": "ICYMI: Alan Tonelson in the New York Times: ‘What Trump Gets Right On Trade’"}

Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\nOn receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life. Today she is 20 years old—and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan’s story is about the unbounded power of a father’s love for a daughter.\nFinally, to keep America safe we must provide the men and women of the United States Military with the tools they need to prevent war and – if they must – TO FIGHT AND TO WIN.\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\nMy budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our Veterans have delivered for this nation – and now we must deliver for them.\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great.\nBut our people are even greater.\nAnd none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\nBut we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past – we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\nThe only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\nAmerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\nCures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\nAmerican footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\nAnd streets where mothers are safe from fear—schools where children learn in peace—and jobs where Americans prosper and grow—are not too much to ask.\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before.\nThe time for small thinking is over.\nThe time for trivial fights is behind us.\nWe just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\nThe bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\nAnd the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations – not burdened by our fears.", "timestamp": "2017-02-28T00:00:00", "title": "Excerpts from President Donald J.

It’s expected to significantly strengthen the office that pushes the federal government to do business with the colleges by moving it to the White House…\n…\n“It would be truly, truly historic,” said Leonard Haynes, a longtime educator who ran the office and is helping to write the executive order. “It’s part of a long time dream...none of (the other presidents) had the courage to do it.”\nThough African-Americans overwhelmingly support Democrats at the polls, many education experts credit Republican leaders for helping to improve HBCUs, the common shorthand for historically black schools.\nSome black college administrators say they were disappointed in President Barack Obama for not making the schools a priority and, in some cases, harming their financial health and contributing to declining enrollment with the changes he made to loan programs.\n…\n“The president has a strong commitment to them and understands over the last eight years they've been woefully neglected,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. “And I think he wants to really show a commitment. ... And so you’ll see, I think, not just a push this month, but in his budget and going forward.”\n…\nDuring the transition and into the start of his presidency, Trump’s advisers met with HBCU officials as they considered how to make good on Trump’s “New Deal For Black America,” which he unveiled at a speech in Charlotte, N.C. that alluded to black colleges.\nThose meetings included Omarosa Manigault, a graduate of Central State University in Ohio and Washington’s Howard University, both HBCUs. She gained fame in the first season of “The Apprentice” and now serves as communications director for the Office of Public Liaison in the White House.\n…\nSome are pushing him to commit to a goal that HBCUs be awarded 5 percent of total federal grant, internship and cooperative agreement funding; and 10 percent of total federal contract funding awarded to colleges and universities, which would nearly double federal support to HBCUs. They also hope he will boost funding in his budget to be released mid-March.\n…\nThe executive order will coincide with the visit of about 90 presidents of historically black colleges and universities, who will be in Washington for a daylong conference. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. are scheduled to attend.\nRead the entire article here.", "timestamp": "2017-02-27T00:00:00", "title": "ICYMI: President Trump Seeks to Outdo Obama in Backing Black Colleges"}

Those are their words, so I apologize to my mom. But literally those are the words of the FBI, that the story is B.S. They came to us, they approached us. We're putting that story out there. I think the American people deserve to know the truth and that’s exactly what it is, that there's nothing here. Just because reporters say something over and over and over again doesn't start to make it true. At some point, we get to a place where we have got to move on and start focusing on the things that the American people care about and I don't think this is it. We’ve talked about it time and time and time again, asked and answered. Let's move forward. Let's start talking about the economy. Let's talk about education. Let's talk about border security. Let's talk about national security. That's what's keeping most Americans up at night. That's what they want us focused on and that's what this Administration is doing day in and day out.”\nSanders: “Even Democrats will admit Obamacare is simply not sustainable. It's collapsing under itself.”\nSANDERS: “What I know that the President can promise is exactly what he's been saying. . . . This is not just a repeal program, [and] we absolutely have to repeal it but replace it with something that's better. George, even Democrats will admit Obamacare is simply not sustainable. It's collapsing under itself. It cannot maintain the track we're on. We have to make big changes. I think both Republicans and Democrats agree with that. This was a program that was shoved through with so many problems and we're still every day finding out new problems [with] this program. We know that we can't just repeal it and not do anything else. We have to repeal it, and we have to replace it with something better. That’s what this President is committed to doing and that’s exactly what we’re working to do.”\nSanders: “This was a President who campaigned on speaking directly to Americans and that's exactly what he's going to spend his time doing.”\nSANDERS: “George, I think it's pretty safe to say, I think we all spend enough time around each other as it is. But look, this wasn't a President who was elected to spend his time with reporters and celebrities. This was a President who campaigned on speaking directly to Americans and that's exactly what he's going to spend his time doing. I think it's kind of naive of us to think we can all walk into a room for a couple of hours and pretend that some of that tension isn't there. You know, one of the things we say in the south: ’if a girl scout egged your house, would you buy cookies from her?’ I think this is a pretty similar scenario. There's no reason for him to go in and sit and pretend like this is going to be just another Saturday night. I think he's very focused on protecting our borders, national security, growing our economy, and instead of going and spending a night doing that, I think he'll spend the night focused on what he can do to better America.”", "timestamp": "2017-02-26T00:00:00", "title": "Top Highlights From Sunday’s Shows"}

The stock market is shattering records. Job numbers are improving. These data points are evidence that the economic \"spirit of optimism\" about which President Trump has spoken frequently in recent days is real.\nAs the National Association of Manufacturers kicks off its annual \"State of Manufacturing\" tour this week, we can declare that manufacturers in America are optimistic about the future because we now have a true advocate, partner and ally in the White House.\n…\nBut there is a new focus with this administration. From the very first day of business, Trump opened up the White House for listening sessions for manufacturers to share ideas and concerns with him and his staff. And the president personally visited Boeing — a major manufacturing exporter — to celebrate the unveiling of its impressive new Dreamliner.\nRecently, Intel’s CEO stood in the Oval Office to announce the company's plan to invest $7 billion in a U.S. factory that will create 10,000 American jobs. Lockheed-Martin pledged to add 1,800 jobs. Numerous automakers have announced major investments in U.S. facilities. And, similarly, other global companies are making major investments in the future of manufacturing in the United States. Take for example, Bayer's $8 billion acquisition of Monsanto. This is the largest deal ever in the agriculture industry and will keep the headquarters in St. Louis, Mo.\n…\nTo connect more people with solid manufacturing careers, we need to see more change from Washington. Trump pledged to slash bureaucratic red tape, cut taxes for our workers and businesses, and negotiate strong trade deals. He vowed to unleash American energy. Manufacturers look forward to Trump delivering on his promises, just as he has already delivered on promises to prioritize major infrastructure projects and reduce the burden of government regulations.\nIndeed, Trump is off to a great start, and we are excited about the pro-growth tax reform, healthcare and infrastructure investment plans that are expected to come in the near future.\nManufacturers will continue engaging with the administration to craft policies that put Americans back to work. The only way to lift everyone up and leave no one behind is with a strong and growing manufacturing jobs base. We are proud to work alongside President Trump — and any leader who believes in manufacturing's promise — to make manufacturing and our nation greater than ever before.\nJay Timmons is president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\nRead the entire article here.", "timestamp": "2017-02-24T00:00:00", "title": "ICYMI: President Trump's Focus Brings Renewed Optimism to America's Manufacturers"}

Chuck Grassley\n“We will keep our word” and put Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\nThe late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was an intellectual giant and a revered defender of the Constitution and the limited role of the judiciary in our Republic. His contributions to the court and to broader judicial philosophy will endure for years. Now, we’ll keep our word to the American people to consider a nominee by the new president.\n…\nThe nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia’s seat is the product of the most transparent and democratic judicial nomination process in recent history. On the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump’s list of 21 potential nominees for the vacancy provided rare insight into who could be the next justice in a Trump presidency. The vacancy was on the minds of many voters as they elected Trump to be our next president. According to the Pew Research Center, 65% of voters considered the vacancy very important as they went to the polls.\nPrior to the president’s announcement, the minority leader called on him to nominate a “mainstream” candidate. There can be no serious debate that Judge Gorsuch meets that standard. He’s been praised by legal experts across the political spectrum as a mainstream jurist who applies the law without regard to person, politics or his own preferences. President Obama’s former solicitor general called him “one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.” That’s high praise. In 2006 Judge Gorsuch sailed through the Senate with unanimous approval. Thirty-one sitting senators were in the Senate when Gorsuch was confirmed, including 12 Democrats. Nonetheless, we have promised a rigorous and thorough review of this nominee, and that’s what we’ll do.\nThe committee will follow the established confirmation timeline for modern Supreme Court vacancies, with a hearing roughly six weeks after the initial nomination. That is more than sufficient time for senators to review his record.\n…\nUnfortunately, some Senate Democrats signaled plans to block any nomination made by the newly-elected president even before he announced his nomination. They’re doing so after criticizing Republicans for taking a principled position about a lame duck president that was advocated by Democrats for decades.\n…\nInstead, we will keep our word and we will fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.\nSen.

Not only will these efforts enhance efficiency at our shared border, they will also strengthen our shared security.  In the spirit of a more efficient and secure border, we will also examine ways to further integrate our border operations, including analysis of the feasibility of co-locating border officials in common processing facilities.\nBecause we share a strong concern about the increase in opioid-related deaths, our countries will work together on common solutions to protect our people from opioid trafficking.\nGiven the integrated nature of the infrastructure that supports our intertwined economies, cyber threats to either country can affect the other.  We therefore commit to further cooperation to enhance critical infrastructure security, cyber incident management, public awareness, private sector engagement, and capacity building initiatives.\nAllies in the World\nWe are indispensable allies in the defense of North America and other parts of the world, through NATO and other multilateral efforts.  Our troops have time and again fought together and sacrificed their lives for our shared values.  The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) illustrates the strength of our mutual commitment.  United States and Canadian forces jointly conduct aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in defense of North America.  We will work to modernize and broaden our NORAD Partnership in these key domains, as well as in cyber and space.\nThe United States welcomes Canada’s recently announced decision to launch an open and transparent competition to replace its legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft.  The United States also welcomes Canada’s decision to explore the immediate acquisition of 18 new Super Hornet aircraft as an interim capability to supplement the CF-18s until the permanent replacement is ready.  Canada appreciates the cooperation of the United States to facilitate these processes.\nThe United States values Canada’s military contributions, including in the Global Coalition to Counter-ISIS and in Latvia.  Together, we are harnessing all elements of national power to achieve the goal of degrading and destroying ISIS through our military operations to deny it safe havens and to build the capacity of local partners, stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters into the Middle East region, cut off access to financing and funding, counter the ISIS narrative, and support the stabilization of communities liberated from ISIS.\nEmpowering Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders\nIt is a priority of both countries to ensure equal opportunities for women in the workforce.  We are committed to removing barriers to women’s participation in the business community and supporting women as they advance through it.  As part of this effort, we are creating a United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.  We expect this initiative to promote the growth of women-owned enterprises and to further contribute to our overall economic growth and competitiveness, as well as the enhanced integration of our economies.\nThe Way Forward\nWe share a commitment to continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our mutual prosperity and security. We look forward to our cabinets following up on today’s meeting with further discussions in their respective areas of responsibility.  Our countries deserve our full commitment to increased economic growth, which we will deliver.  The partnership between the United States and Canada will continue to be unique and a model for the world.", "timestamp": "2017-02-13T00:00:00", "title": "Joint Statement from President Donald J.

That includes, you can continue the appeal [in] the Ninth [Circuit], you can seek an emergency stay at the Supreme Court, you can have a trial hearing on the merits at the district level, or you can take it en banc for the emergency hearing also at the Ninth Circuit, and yes, you can pursue additional executive actions. The bottom line is that we are pursuing every single possible action to keep our country safe from terrorism. And I also want to be clear, we’ve heard a lot of talk about how all of the branches of government are equal. That’s the point. They are equal. There’s no such thing as judicial supremacy. What the judges did both at the Ninth [Circuit] and at the district level was to take power for themselves that belongs squarely in the hands of the President of the United States.”\nMiller on Fox’s Fox News Sunday on the President’s authority to conduct immigration and national security policy: “The President’s powers here are beyond question. . . .They represent the very apex of Presidential authority.”\nMILLER: “But I want to say something very clearly, and this is going to be very disappointing to the people protesting the President and the people in Congress like Senator Schumer who have attacked the President for his lawful and necessary action. The President’s powers here are beyond question. The President has the authority under the INA, section 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), to suspend the entry of aliens into this country and he has Article II foreign [affairs] powers to also engage in conducting border control and immigration control [for] this country. Those powers are substantial. They represent the very apex of Presidential authority. And so we are contemplating new and additional actions to ensure that our immigration system does not become a vehicle for admitting people into our country who are hostile to this Nation and its values.”\nMiller on ABC’s This Week on North Korea’s Missile Test: “The message we’re sending to the world right now is a message of strength and solidarity.”\nMILLER: “The message we’re sending to the world right now is a message of strength and solidarity. We stand with Japan and we stand with our allies in the region to address the North Korean menace. And the important point is that we’re inheriting a situation around the world that is as challenging as any we’ve ever seen in our lives. The situation in North Korea, the situation in Syria, the situation in Yemen. These are complex and difficult challenges, and that’s why President Trump is displaying the strength of America to the whole world. And it’s why we’re going to begin a process of rebuilding our depleted defense capabilities on a scale we have not seen in generations.”\nMiller on NBC’s Meet The Press: “We should have a program in which American workers are given jobs first.”\nMILLER: “I believe that we should have a program in which American workers are given jobs first. The President campaigned on this, it’s an issue where the labor unions agree with us, it’s an issue where many Democrat members of Congress agree with us. If you have an open job in this country, a U.S. citizen or existing legal permanent resident ought to have the ability to make the first application for that job. The problem is in the way the media covers this issue, present company excluded, is [that] they don’t spend enough time talking about the well-being of the 300 million people here today, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, many of whom are living in poverty, many of whom who haven’t seen wage growth in 20 [or] 30 years, and its time we talked about them—their needs, their families, and their concerns—and yes we’ll have a lawful immigration system. It will enrich and benefit our country. But the President has made clear that he believes [it] should be a merit-based system, where individuals coming to the country bring the kinds of benefits economically that will grow our economy and help lift up wages for everybody.”\nMiller on CBS’s Face The Nation on the Trump Administration’s opening weeks: “On issue after issue, we’re taking forceful action to deliver on the President’s campaign promises on a breathtaking scale.”\nMILLER: “The President of the United States has accomplished more in just a few weeks than many presidents accomplish in an entire administration. You’ve seen, for instance, profound regulatory reform: for every one new regulation, two must go. You’ve seen ethics reforms to drain the swamp. You’ve seen efforts to bring back jobs with Intel and Ford and General Motors. You’ve seen action taken with an executive order to go after criminal cartels that have plagued our cities for years with no effective response. On issue after issue, we’re taking forceful action to deliver on the President’s campaign promises on a breathtaking scale.”", "timestamp": "2017-02-12T00:00:00", "title": "Top Highlights From Sunday’s Shows"}

Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held their first official meeting today in Washington D.C. and affirmed their strong determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance and economic relationship.\nU.S.-Japan Alliance\nThe unshakable U.S.-Japan Alliance is the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and freedom in the Asia-Pacific region.  The U.S. commitment to defend Japan through the full range of U.S. military capabilities, both nuclear and conventional, is unwavering.  Amid an increasingly difficult security environment in the Asia-Pacific region, the United States will strengthen its presence in the region, and Japan will assume larger roles and responsibilities in the alliance.  The United States and Japan will continue to implement and expand defense cooperation as laid out in the 2015 U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines.  The United States and Japan will further enhance cooperation with allies and partners in the region.  The two leaders underscored the importance of maintaining international order based upon the rule of law.\nThe two leaders affirmed the commitment of the United States and Japan to the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan, to ensure the long-term, sustainable presence of U.S. forces.  They affirmed that the United States and Japan are committed to the plan to construct the Futenma Replacement Facility at the Camp Schwab/Henoko area and in adjacent waters.  It is the only solution that avoids the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.\nThe two leaders affirmed that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security covers the Senkaku Islands.  They oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine Japan's administration of these islands.  The United States and Japan will deepen cooperation to safeguard the peace and stability of the East China Sea.  The two leaders underscored the importance of maintaining a maritime order based on international law, including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea.  The United States and Japan oppose any attempt to assert maritime claims through the use of intimidation, coercion or force.  The United States and Japan also call on countries concerned to avoid actions that would escalate tensions in the South China Sea, including the militarization of outposts, and to act in accordance with international law.\nThe United States and Japan strongly urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and not to take any further provocative actions.  The U.S.-Japan Alliance is fully capable of ensuring the security of Japan.  The United States is fully committed to defending its homeland, forces, and allies, through the full range of U.S. military capabilities.  The two leaders affirmed the importance of an early resolution of the abductions issue.  They also affirmed the importance of trilateral cooperation among the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea.  The United States and Japan are also committed to rigorous implementation of the U.N.

Why? Trump's War On Regulation\nBy Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer at US Global Investors\nCNBC\nFebruary 7, 2017\nConfidence among chief executives of U.S.-based companies — and relative to other CEOs around the world — just experienced one of the largest single-quarter gains in history, up by 4.2 points in the quarterly YPO Global Pulse survey. Why? By now it's easy to just say \"Trump.\" Here's an underappreciated part of that business optimism story.\nLast week President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring that for every new federal regulation that's adopted, two old ones must be scrapped. This goes a step further than Canada's One-for-One Rule, implemented in 2012. It managed to save Canadian businesses more than $22 million and 290,000 compliance hours between 2012 and 2014 alone, according to the Government of Canada.\nSuch a rule has been long overdue in U.S. regulations — or indirect taxation, as I call them — which often stand in the way of growth and create economic friction. The libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute calculates that the annual cost of regulations amounts to a jaw-dropping $1.9 trillion, a figure that in 2014 exceeded the $1.7 trillion collected in federal income taxes.\nClick Here To Read The Full Article", "timestamp": "2017-02-08T00:00:00", "title": "ICYMI: CNBC: “CEO Confidence At Near-Record High.

So Why Is This Time Different?\nMcClatchy\nAnita Kumar\nFebruary 6, 2017\nhttp://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article131121184.html\nDonald Trump’s travel ban isn’t new.\nSix of the last seven presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have relied on the same federal law to keep certain groups of foreigners out of the United States.\nJimmy Carter denied entry to Iranians in April 1980 after a failed rescue mission for American hostages in Iran. Ronald Reagan barred migrants arriving at the borders from “the high seas” in September 1981, targeting Haitians and Cubans. Bill Clinton in November 1999 barred those responsible for repressing civilians in Kosovo. And George W. Bush in June 2001 banned those who planned or carried out wartime atrocities in the Western Balkans.\n“In general, all presidents have used executive orders to impact immigration policy,” said Clete Samson, an immigration attorney who spent years as a federal trial attorney for the Department of Homeland Security.\nIn each case, the presidents relied on 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), a statute that gives them wide latitude over who can come into the country.\n“Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,” the law says.\nTrump cited the law when issuing his executive order last month that froze refugee admissions and temporarily blocked people from seven Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – from entering the United States, even with valid visas.\n…\nCritics call Trump’s order a Muslim ban, the same one he spoke of on the campaign trail. But the White House pushes back on the label, saying the nations were not chosen because they are Muslim majority. More than 40 countries that are Muslim-majority were not included in the ban.\n“Congress has given the office of the president broad power to suspend entry of foreign nationals when doing so would be in the national interest,” said Raj Shah, deputy communications director at the White House. “President Trump acted well within his authority and in a manner also exercised by previous presidents in similar ways.”\n…\nMost recently, President Barack Obama in August 2011 banned immigrants who had committed or participated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, violations of human rights or violence against any civilian population based on race, color, descent, sex and a host of other conditions that ranged from disability to membership in a particular social group.\n“The United States’ enduring commitment to respect for human rights and humanitarian law requires that its government be able to ensure that the United States does not become a safe haven for serious violators of human rights and humanitarian law and those who engage in other related abuses,” he wrote in his order.\n…\n[W]hite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Monday dismissed suggestions that the administration could withdraw the order and rewrite it.\n“Clearly the law is on the president’s side,” he said. “The Constitution is on the president’s side. He has broad discretion to do what’s in the nation’s best interest to protect our people.”\n…\nClick Here to view full article.", "timestamp": "2017-02-07T00:00:00", "title": "IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: McClatchy On Historical Precedent For President’s National Security Executive Order"}

Trump.  This is an interview about the Super Bowl and issues important to sports fans.  We will get to the news of the day shortly.  Mr. President, how are you today?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’m very good, thank you, Jim.\nMr. President, you sit with Bob Kraft, you communicate with Bill Belichick, Tom Brady is a friend -- can we take that from your personal relationships that you’re rooting for the Patriots today?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I guess you have to say that.  They’ve been great friends of mine for a long period of time and they’re terrific people.  And I have to tell you, the Falcons have terrific people also.  But I’ve known them a long time, so I guess we’re allowed to do that every once in a while.  They are really wonderful.  I think it’s going to be a wonderful game, actually.\nQ    Have you communicated with Tom Brady or Bill Belichick this week?  And if so, what advice have you given them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t have to give them advice.  These are champions.  These are winners, they know how to win.  And I speak to them on occasion, but I don’t have to really speak very much about winning.  They know how to do it.  And it’s a lot of pressure on them, but probably less so because they’ve been there and they’ve done it before.  So more pressure always on the ones that haven’t done it.\nQ    Mr. President, how do you feel about the abuse that’s being directed to Tom Brady because he’s a friend of yours?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I haven’t seen it.  I mean, honestly, I’ve been so busy doing other things I haven’t seen that.  I haven’t noticed it.  But I can tell you that, generally speaking, that’s a two-way street.  There may be some people that aren’t liking the fact that he may feel good about me, but there are a lot of other people that like him a lot better because of it.\nSo that really has proven to be a two-way street.  There have been many instances of that, where people have sort of said -- a little bit negative about whatever it may be, even a store or a chain, and the chain’s business goes through the roof.  I mean, we’ve had cases like that too.  So it really is a two-way street, Jim.\nQ    Mr. President, what are your thoughts on Deflate-gate and the way that Tom Brady was treated?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think Tom Brady is a great guy.  And it’s over with, and we don’t have to discuss it, but it was a rough period of time and it was very sad.  I thought it was very sad.  And look at the season he’s had -- missing four games, and look at the great season he’s had.  So I just think it was an unfortunate experience, and I think it was bad for probably everybody involved.  And that’s all behind us, so that’s a good thing.\nQ    You’ve had some very strong negative opinions about Roger Goodell in the aftermath of his decisions on domestic violence and Deflate-gate.  You’re now President; he’s obviously the commissioner of the NFL.  If you were to see him and your paths were to cross, what would you say to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’d just say good luck, just do a good job with the NFL.  I mean, he handled the various situations -- this was prior to me running for office -- and he handled the various situations in his way, and I hope he’s happy with it.  I think it’s good if he is.  But people can disagree on everything.  I may really have looked upon the way he handled it a little bit differently than others, but, you know what, it’s the NFL.  It’s going to do well.  The game is going to be very interesting.  We’ll see what happens.\nQ    You plan to pardon Tom Brady?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, Tom is always pardoned, you know that.  Tom doesn’t need a pardon.  His game pardons him, and his talent.  He’s a great champion.  So I think his game really pardons him.  And, frankly, I don’t think he’s somebody that has to be pardoned.\nQ    With all the head injuries and concussions, a big concern now with football, would you allow your grandchildren and Barron to play if they wanted?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If they wanted I would allow them to play, but I will say that they have to be very careful, because that would be the big risk to the NFL if it gets to a point where people are afraid to let their children play.  That would not be a good thing for the NFL, certainly.  But it depends on the level.  I mean, I know -- I played football at a certain level, and I will tell you, it’s a rough game, it’s a tough game.  And there’s something really good about that in terms of competition and learning how to compete and win.  But it’s a rough game, and a lot of people are deciding the other way.\nBut regardless, I would also leave it up to the young person in the family.  I think I would have to do that.\nQ    Mr. President, the NFL Players Association is fighting to legalize the use of medicinal marijuana for its players.  These guys take a physical beating.  Would you support them in this fight?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I have no opinion on it.  They’re going to have to take a look at that.  They’re going to talk with the League, they’re going to be talking to, obviously, government officials wherever it may be.  And when it comes up to the level of the presidency I’ll have an opinion.\nQ    You know quite a bit, as a former casino owner, and you have a particular insight -- today an estimated $5 billion will be wagered, $4.8 billion, unregulated and untaxed illegally.  What is your position and thoughts on making sports gambling legal nationwide?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I’d do is I’d sit down with the commissioners.  I would be talking to them, and we’ll see how they feel about it.  Some would not want it, and probably others -- and I’ve read others maybe do.  But I would certainly want to get their input and get the input from the various leagues, and we’ll see how they feel about it.  I’d also get the input from lots of law enforcement officials, because, obviously, that’s a big step.\nSo we wouldn’t do it lightly, I can tell you.  It will be studied very carefully.  But I would want to have a lot of input from a lot of different people.\nQ    Jim Gray with President Trump.  This interview was recorded just prior to kickoff.  Mr. President, Los Angeles will bid for the 2024 Olympics in the fall.  Do you support that bid, and would it be a good thing for Los Angeles and our country?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ve been asked to support it, and I’ve actually spoken to the Olympic Committee in Europe.  And they are -- I think were very happy when they spoke to me.  They wanted to have an endorsement from me and I gave it to them very loud and clear.  I would love to see the Olympics go to Los Angeles.  I think that it would be terrific.  The United States’ committee’s members have asked me to speak up about it, and I have.  And I think I’ve helped them.  And let’s see what happens.\nBut I’d be very happy and honored if they would choose Los Angeles and would stand behind it.\nQ    Do you feel your immigration policy and the recent executive order might hurt the bid and cost LA some IOC votes?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t know, but we have to have -- regardless, we have to have security in our country.  We have to know who’s coming into our country.  We have to have people that are coming in with good intentions, Jim.  If people are coming in with bad intentions, I want to be able to find out before they get here.\nYou see what’s happened in other countries, you see what’s happened in our country.  Take a look at so many different events, including the World Trade Center.  So if people want to come into our country, they have to come in with good intentions.  And we want to have strong borders.  And we want to have extreme vetting, and we want to know what we’re doing, frankly.  And right now, it’s tied up in the courts.  And I think it’s a bad situation for the country.  I think it’s very, very bad.  We have to know exactly who’s coming into our country.  And I think most people agree with me on that.  And they may not express it, but you’re seeing it more and more, people are agreeing with me.  I want security for the United States.\nQ    Now, Mr. President, many Russian athletes were banned from competing in the Rio Olympics last summer due to the Russian state-sponsored doping program.  Should that ban continue in 2018 in Korea and 2020 in Tokyo until the Russians can prove that they’re clean, and are you willing to express that to President Putin?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that’s going to be really up to the various Olympic committees.  They’ve taken a very strong stand, and that’s going to be up to them, much more so than me.  So we’ll see what they have to say, Jim.\nQ    Mr. President, leaving aside your desire to have a productive relationship with President Putin, your comments earlier today to Bill O’Reilly on Fox before the Super Bowl seemed to indicate an equivalency between the actions of our government and the actions of the Russian government.  Can you kind of clarify that statement?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t have to clarify it.  The question was do you respect him -- he’s a head of a major country.  He’s actually very popular in his country if you listen to the various reports that are actually put out by polling agencies and various groups within our country, whether they like it or not.  But they asked me whether or not I respect him.  He’s the leader of a major country, and you know what my answer was.\nAnd, frankly, there are a lot of bad things going on in a lot of places in this world, and if we get along with Russia -- I don’t know that we will, I don’t know the gentleman, but I’ve had two conversations or three conversations with him.  He called to congratulate me on the inauguration recently, and called to congratulate me previously on the election.  And it was very nice and I appreciated the call.  But I’ve been called by virtually every leader of the world.  We’ve been called by just about everybody, so I don’t put a lot of credence to that.\nI will say this.  If we get along with Russia and other countries -- I mean, I want to get along with all countries -- but if we got along with Russia, if we got along with China, if we got along with Japan -- and the Prime Minister is coming next weekend.  In fact, he’s coming to the White House and then he’d like to play golf, and we’re going to come down to Florida, Palm Beach, and we’re going to play golf.  We’re going to have a round of golf, which is a great thing.  That’s the one thing about golf -- you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch.\nSo if we are able to get along with other countries, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.\nQ    Will you have a bet?  Is he a good golfer?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  I think -- I know he loves the game, and we’re going to have a lot of fun.  It won’t matter.  I’ll just make sure he’s my partner.\nQ    Mr. President, people feel that divides are getting deeper in our country.  The first couple of weeks in office, you see what’s happening across the country.  Today in sports, right here on the field, and in the military, we see people with different backgrounds come together for the common good.  What concrete plans do you have to unite our country and bring our nation together?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s great that they come together.  But I will say, we were a very divided country before I came along.  And one of the reasons I won the election is because of the fact that we were such a divided country.  We have a tremendous group of people that -- you look at issues and you look at what’s going on, and there was such division in our country.  And I think a lot of people think that I’m going to be able to bring it together, and I think I will be able to do that.\nBut we have been a very, very divided country for a very long period of time.  And, you know, I guess they consider me to be very much of an outsider, but it’s an outsider that can bring us together.  And I think I’ll be able to do that.\nQ    Is it tougher being a boxing promotor or President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, boxing is an interesting -- I’ve had many, many fights, as you know.  I’ve been involved with just about everybody in that business, and I really enjoy the boxing and I enjoy what they’ve done with the UFC, Dana White and all of the folks, the families that have done such a great job with that.  And I enjoy sports of any kind.  I enjoy virtually every sport.\nAnd sports -- nothing is easy.  Sports isn’t easy.  But I have great respect for what they’re doing and what they’re doing with the -- I think today’s game is terrific, and I think it’s going to be terrific.\nQ    You’ve now been in office a couple of weeks.  Monday-morning-quarterback yourself, how would you assess how you’ve done?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think I’ve done well.  I think polls are showing that I’ve done well.  It’s been tough on a lot of people because we’re breaking the glass a little bit.  We’re doing what has to be done.  We’re being strong on vetting, we’re being strong on coming into the country.  It’s very easy if you just let it be the way it was, but the FBI has over 1,000 investigations going on right now on terror and terrorism.  They’ve never had anything like that before.  And that’s been reported all over the place.\nAnd frankly, we have to have a safe country.  But I think I’ve done very well.  We have plants coming back and going into Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the car companies are pouring back into our country.  I’ve saved hundreds of millions of dollars in negotiation on the F-35 fighter jet and various military elements that I’ve gotten involved in the negotiation.  I’ve saved hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.  That will end up being many, many billions of dollars.\nI think I’ve getting very high marks by a lot of people.\nQ    Mr. President, thank you so much for your time.  I really appreciate it.  It’s an honor to have you join us and share your views.  Enjoy the rest of Super Bowl Sunday.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Jim.  Thank you.\nEND", "timestamp": "2017-02-05T00:00:00", "title": "Radio Interview of President Trump by Jim Gray, Westwood One Sports Radio"}

And in Judge Neil Gorsuch he has done that. This is someone who is extraordinarily qualified. His academic background is remarkable from Columbia, to Harvard, to Oxford. He literally was ten years ago confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate and we are very encouraged at this point that more than at half a dozen Democrats have committed themselves to an up or down look on the floor of the Senate. Neil Gorsuch belongs on the United States Supreme Court. But no Associate Justice to the Supreme Court in American history has ever faced a successful filibuster and Neil Gorsuch should not be the first. That’s why both the President and I have made it clear that we are going to work with Senate leadership and one way or another, Judge Gorsuch is going to get an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate. And we are confident he will be confirmed as the newest Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.”\nVice President Mike Pence On CBS’ “Face The Nation”: The Trump Administration Is “Busy Keeping Our Promises To The American People.”\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “Probably, you know, I look at the first few days of this administration, and I love to tell people to watch this president work sitting behind that Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. You see a president who is in the promise-keeping business. And, my view, chief among those promises, was his commitment to nominate someone to the Supreme Court who will be faithful to the Constitution, interpret the law as written. But he also said he wanted someone who was exceptionally qualified, and Judge Neil Gorsuch, with his academic background, with ten years on the court, as someone who was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate ten years ago to the Court of Appeals in the Tenth Circuit, I think represents that promise kept to the American people. And we remain very confident that, despite some of the posturing that we see in the Senate today, that Judge Gorsuch is going to be well received by the members in the Senate.”\nVice President Mike Pence On NBC’s “Meet The Press”: “President Trump Has Made It Clear He's Going To Put The Safety And The Security Of The American People First.”\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “From the outset of his campaign for president and the outset of this administration, President Trump has made it clear he's going to put the safety and the security of the American people first. And using a list of countries that the Obama Administration and the Congress have certified, were compromised by terrorist influence. Seven different countries, permanently suspending immigration from Syria, and suspending for a set period of time the remaining six countries, is consistent with the president's commitment to do just that. We are very confident the president is operating within his authority as president, both under the constitution and under clear, statutory law.”\nVice President Mike Pence On Fox’s “Fox News Sunday”: “The Iranians Would Do Well To Look At The Calendar And Recognize That We’ve Got A New President In The Oval Office.”\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “The Iranians would do well to look at the calendar and recognize that we’ve got a new president in the oval office. That disastrous nuclear deal that the last administration entered into with Iran, as General Flynn said, should have encouraged better behavior by the Iranians. But instead what we see, whether it be their flouting UN Security Council resolutions banning ballistic missile tests, or whether it be the way they’re arming the Houthis in Yemen who just last week attacked a Saudi Arabian ship. What we’re seeing here is hostile action, belligerent action, being supported by or taken by the Iranians, and we’re just not going to put up with it anymore.”\nVice President Mike Pence On Fox’s “Fox News Sunday”: “We Are Going To Work Hard To Advance That Kind Of Regulatory Reform That Will Make Resources And Loans Available For A Growing America.”\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “The message that we are sending to Main Street is that we are going to pull back this mountain of red tape that is stifling access to capital and loans, particularly for small businesses across this country. We will get this economy moving again. I’ve got to tell you, both on the campaign trail with the president and since the outset of this administration, in meetings with business leaders and labor leaders, they tell us that in addition to cutting taxes, that rolling back the avalanche of red tape that is stifling the economy, and, frankly, stifling the availability of loans and financial resources for companies, is of paramount importance. And the action the president took this week, surrounded by leaders in Congress who have been working to reform, if not repeal Dodd-Frank, is just the beginning of that effort, and we’re going to continue to work hard while we protect consumers along the way. We are going to work hard to advance that kind of regulatory reform that will make resources and loans available for a growing America.”", "timestamp": "2017-02-05T00:00:00", "title": "Top Highlights From Sunday’s Shows"}

Walker, who became one of the most successful female entrepreneurs of her time, paved the way for both women and African Americans in their respective fields.  Robert Smalls, a man born into slavery, founded our Nation's first free and compulsory public school system.  Later in life, he served as a lawmaker in South Carolina's State legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives.  The strength and determination of men and women like these remind us that our Nation brims with people whose contributions continue to make it stronger and better.\nThis year, African American History Month calls upon us to reflect on the crucial role of education in the history of African Americans.  It reminds us of the importance of teaching and reflecting upon the many roles African Americans have played in building this Nation and driving it forward.  This year's theme also calls upon us to rededicate ourselves to the work of ensuring that all children in this Nation have access to quality educational opportunities that give them the skills, experiences, relationships, and credentials that can empower them to follow in the footsteps of people like Katherine Johnson, Madam C.J. Walker, and Robert Smalls.\nAs we journey toward a stronger, more united Nation, let us use this commemoration of African American History Month to serve as a reminder of the need for meaningful dialogue and shared commitment to collective action that uplifts and empowers, as well as of the strength, ingenuity, and perseverance required of us in the years to come.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as National African American History Month.  I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Gorsuch U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nNeil M. Gorsuch has served for over a decade as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, building a nationally respected and distinguished judicial record and reputation.\nJudge Gorsuch is a brilliant jurist with an outstanding intellect and a clear, incisive writing style. He is universally respected for his integrity, fairness, and decency. And he understands the role of judges is to interpret the law, not impose their own policy preferences, priorities, or ideologies.\nJudge Gorsuch is a native Westerner and avid outdoorsman.  He spent his childhood in Colorado and chose to return West to raise his family.  He enjoys fishing, hiking, and skiing.  And he and his wife care for animals, including a horse, in the small barn at their home.  As a young man, he delivered papers and worked as a front desk clerk at a Howard Johnson to make extra money.\nJudge Gorsuch has an impressive range of professional experience.\nJudge Gorsuch was confirmed by the U.S. Senate without opposition on July 20, 2006, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  Indeed, 11 current Democrat Senators—including Minority Leader Schumer, Sen. Leahy, and Sen. Feinstein—and 20 current Republican Senators were in office when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed by voice vote, without opposition.  He received a “unanimously well qualified rating” by the American Bar Association.\nPrior to serving on the court, Judge Gorsuch had extensive trial and appellate litigation experience as a practicing attorney, and then served his country the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General in 2005.  In that position he assisted in managing major aspects of the Department’s work in areas such as constitutional law, counterterrorism, environmental regulation, and civil rights.\nJudge Gorsuch worked as an associate and partner at the law firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel, PLLC from 1995 to 2005.\nJudge Gorsuch’s academic credentials are impeccable.\nJudge Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School as a Harry Truman Scholar and graduated with honors in 1991.  He graduated with honors from Columbia University in 1988, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.  After law school, he attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar, and he received his Doctorate in Philosophy in 2004.\nHe clerked for Justice Byron White and Justice Kennedy of Supreme Court of the United States and Judge David Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\nJudge Gorsuch is a “judge’s judge” who decides cases based on the law, not personal policy preferences.  He is not afraid to reach results contrary to his own policy views.\nEchoing a common theme of Justice Scalia’s jurisprudence, Judge Gorsuch once wrote that “a judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.”\nFederal Judicial Service\nJudge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (Denver)\nNominated by President George W.

I think it's one of these things that-- and if you ask a lot of the people at the customs and border patrol would just tell you you’ve got to just rip off the Band-Aid and you have to move forward. It wasn't chaos. The fact of the matter is 325,000 people from foreign countries came into the United States yesterday and 109 people were detained for further questioning. Most of those people were moved out. We've got a couple dozen more that remain, and I would suspect as long as they're not awful people that they will move through before another half a day today and perhaps some of these people should be detained further, and if they're folks that shouldn't be in this country they're going to be detained. So apologize for nothing here.”\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer On ABC’s “This Week”: We Must “Ensure That The People That We're Letting Into Our Country Are Coming Here With Peaceful Purposes And Not To Do Us Harm.”\nSPICER: “Let’s look at the facts of what happened. There’s 325,000 people from foreign countries that traveled into the United States yesterday. There were 109 people that this (Executive Order) actually addressed, that had come in post-entry from seven countries that we've identified. In fact, actually, the Obama Administration had previously identified (those seven countries) needed further travel restrictions. We've gone in, as Terry pointed out, it's a 90-day ban to ensure that we have further vetting restrictions so that we know who is coming to this country. The safety of the American citizens, the safety of our country has got to be paramount. And that's what the President did yesterday, is to ensure that the people that we're letting into our country are coming here with peaceful purposes and not to do us harm. So this really comes down to 109 people who are all being processed through the system to make sure that when they've gone out of the country, gone somewhere that is one of those seven countries and coming back, that they've done so and not tried to go there and do anything that would cause our nation harm.”\nOn The President Keeping His Promises\nConway On Fox’s “Fox News Sunday”: “There's A Fundamental Fairness That Donald Trump Ran, Won On And Will Execute” On.\nCONWAY: “There's a fundamental fairness that Donald Trump ran, won on and will execute as President of the United States.

This idea that we’re always worried about the other country, we’re always worried about its citizens. This President says ‘America First.’”\nSpicer On ABC’s “This Week”: President Trump Is Successfully Doing What He Promised The American People He Would Do.\nSPICER: “Look, this is nothing new. President Trump talked about this throughout the campaign and the transition and he's doing exactly what he told the American people he was going to do. It's interesting, the criticism that's coming is from someone who has gotten into office, hit the ground running, had a flurry of activity to do exactly what he said he was going to do.

With such danger, we must have the ability to properly screen each individual seeking to enter our country.\n*\nThis order has absolutely nothing to do with religion – there is no religious test to enter the country.\n*\nWe need to take these steps to ensure that the United States government honors its most important obligation, which is to protect the American people.\nThis EO:\n*\nSuspends visa issuances to countries where adequate screening cannot occur;\n*\nImplements uniform screening standards across all immigration programs to ensure that those who come to the United States do not pose a risk to public safety or national security;\n*\nSuspends the Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days to determine which nationalities pose the least risk for admission to the United States;\n*\nExpedites completion of the biometric entry-exit system;\n*\nEnsures that applicants for visas are, in fact, interviewed before approval; and\n*\nAligns visa-validity periods with the law.\nPresidential Memorandum to Rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces\nTop Line:\n*\nQuote from the President: “We will rebuild our military and alliances, destroy terrorists and face all our enemies head on, and make America safe again.”\n*\nWithin 30 days the Secretary of Defense will submit a “readiness review” to the President and within 60 days a plan to address deficiencies will be put into effect.\n*\nIn an effort to pursue peace through strength, the U.S. military will bolster its capabilities in all areas, including missile defense, cyber defense and nuclear deterrence.\n*\nThe safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President’s top priorities.\nThis Presidential Memorandum:\n*\nMakes it clear that the policy of the United States shall be to rebuild the U.S. armed forces.\n*\nInstructs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a 30-day “readiness review,” in which he will:\n*\n1. Assess readiness conditions, including training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization and infrastructure; and,\n*\n2. Submit to the President a report identifying actions that can be implemented within the current fiscal year and that are necessary to improve readiness conditions.\n*\nInstructs the Secretary of Defense to, within 60 days, submit to the President a plan of action to achieve the levels of readiness identified in the Secretary’s Readiness Review before FY 2019.\n*\nInstructs the Secretary of Defense to produce a National Defense Strategy, which will give the President and the Secretary maximum strategic flexibility and to determine the force structure necessary to meet requirements.\n*\nInstructs the Secretary of Defense to initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review to ensure that the United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies.\n*\nInstructs the Secretary of Defense to initiate a new Ballistic Missile Defense Review to identify ways of strengthening missile-defense capabilities, rebalancing homeland and theater defense priorities, and highlighting priority funding areas.\nPOTUS SCHEDULE\n*\nPhone Call with Prime Minister of Japan\n*\nPhone Call with Chancellor of Germany\n*\nVideo Teleconference with President of Russia\n*\nPhone Call with President of France\n*\nExecutive Order Signing\n*\nPhone Call with Prime Minister of Australia\nNEWS OF THE DAY\nUK PM Theresa May Visits White House\n*\nThe UK and US have a longstanding special relationship, and will continue to work closely together on our mutual security and economic interests.\n*\nIn this meeting, the President hopes to assure the PM and the UK that we remain very focused on the special and vibrant relationship between our two countries.\n*\nThese are two leaders who came into office very similarly – the people of the United States and United Kingdom sent a clear message that they wanted a break from the establishment with a government that puts people first.\n*\nThe President looks forward discussing a bilateral trade agreement with the UK that will create jobs and boost wages for American workers.\n*\nAs the PM said in Philadelphia on Thursday, “we have the opportunity – indeed the responsibility – to renew the Special Relationship for this new age. We have the opportunity to lead, together, again.”\nManufacturing Jobs Initiative\n*\nPresident Trump was put into office in large part due to his promise to bring life back to America’s manufacturing industry, that’s what this initiative is all about.\n*\nThrough this initiative, the President will meet with some of the world’s most successful and creative business leaders to share their experiences and gain their insights.\n*\nThe President plans to continually seek information and perspectives from a diverse range of business leaders on how to get Americans back to work again.\n*\nThis is a continuation of what the President has been doing all week: bringing back jobs that have been outsourced due to policies that don’t help American workers, expanding our manufacturing base, and boosting wages for American workers.\nMarch for Life\n*\nWith both the Vice President and Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway speaking, this administration will have the strongest White House presence in the March’s four-decade history.\n*\nWhen Vice President Pence addresses the March for Life, it will be the first time a sitting Vice President has spoken to the March in person.\n*\nThis week, President Trump signed an Executive Order reestablishing the Mexico City Policy, ending the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas, along with coercive abortion and sterilization practices.\n*\nPresident Trump will continue to pursue policies that support his deep commitment to life.\nPOTUS phone call with Mexican President\n*\nPOTUS and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto spoke by phone Friday morning for an hour.\n*\nThe two had a productive and constructive call regarding the bilateral relationship between the two countries, the current trade deficit the United States has with Mexico, the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales.\n*\nWith respect to payment for the border wall, both presidents recognize their clear and very public differences of positions on this issue but have agreed to work these differences out as part of a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationship.\n*\nBoth presidents have instructed their teams to continue the dialogue to strengthen this important strategic and economic relationship in a constructive way.\nHow to Pay for the Wall\n*\nThe President is working closely with congressional leaders on a plan to pay for a wall along the U.S.’s southern border.\n*\nA tax on Mexican exports coming into the U.S. is just one example of the many ways Mexico could ultimately pay for the wall through comprehensive tax reform.\n*\nThe U.S. has substantial leverage to obtain from Mexico the funds necessary to pay for a border wall.\nOutreach to Congress\n*\nThis week, the Legislative Affairs office met or spoke with more than 110 offices.\n*\nThat’s in addition to the President and Vice President speaking at the Congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia and several Capitol Hill trips from the Vice President.\n*\nAll this was accomplished in just the first week, we intend to continue to reach out to additional members in the days ahead.\n*\nIn just his first few days in office, President Trump has shown a willingness to engage with legislators from both parties in order to get his agenda moving, something that his predecessor rarely did.\n*\nThe President and Vice President together are actively engaging on the Hill, pushing policies that will make Americans safer and get them back to work.\nNational School Choice Week\n*\nFulfilling a campaign promise that he would be the country’s biggest cheerleader for school choice, the President has signed a Proclamation declaring this week National School Choice Week.\n*\nThe foundation of a good life begins with a great education, and today, too many of our children are stuck in schools that do not provide them this opportunity.\n*\nParents should be empowered to make decisions about what type of education best serves their children.\n*\nOur country is home to so many great schools and many extraordinary teachers, serving in all kinds of educational environments – traditional public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, private and religious schools and homeschools.\n*\nMore choices for students will make our schools better for everybody.\nEnhanced Interrogation\n*\nThe President believes enhanced interrogation tactics work, based on the information he has seen.\n*\nHowever, he is deferring to Defense Secretary James Mattis’s position that these tactics should not be reinstated.\n*\nThe President will always follow the law with regard to the interrogation and detention of enemy combatants.\n*\nThe safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland come first.\nExecutive Actions on Immigration and National Security\n*\nTop Line:\n*\nPresident Trump has quickly signed a series of executive actions keeping his promises to reduce the burden of regulations, expedite high priority energy and infrastructure projects, secure our borders, and enforce our immigration laws.\n*\nThese moves will create jobs, boost wages and strengthen our national security.\n*\nThe President has gotten right to work, fighting on behalf of American families, workers and manufacturers.\n*\nEO on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement\n*\nBy directing the immediate construction of a physical wall along the border, this executive order will begin the process of finally securing our border with Mexico once and for all.\n*\nIt will also provide additional tools and resources for the Department of Homeland Security to support the dedicated men and women within the agency who are responsible for securing the border, and will begin the process of hiring more men and women to secure our border.\n*\nThese tools and resources will include more detention space for detained illegal immigrants along the Mexican border, the elimination of the dangerous “catch-and-release” policy, and expanded cooperation with state and local law enforcement.\n*\nThis executive order will also direct the Attorney General to have the Department of Justice prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses with a nexus to the southern border.\n*\nEO on Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\n*\nThis executive order will give the Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to enforce federal immigration law within the United States.\n*\nIt will remove the restraints that have been placed on the dedicated men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and allow them to arrest, detain, and remove illegal immigrants from the United States.\n*\nIt will require the State Department to withhold visas and use other tools to make other countries accept the return of their criminals.\n*\nIt will restore the popular and successful Secure Communities Program, which will once again allow ICE to target criminal illegals for removal.\n*\nIt will also authorize the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to withhold certain types of federal grant funding from sanctuary jurisdictions for efforts to undermine federal immigration law.\nNikki Haley Sworn In as UN Ambassador\n*\nGov. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, is one of the Republican Party's brightest young stars. She will bring the kind of tough, energetic leadership to the United Nations that the United States needs. Her confirmation makes her the first cabinet-level individual of Indian American descent in history.\n*\nGov. Haley agrees with President Trump that the United States needs to turn the page on the failed diplomacy of the past and introduce a bold new, America-first agenda on the international stage.\n*\nShe is the first Republican UN Ambassador to serve in a president’s cabinet in three decades. UN Ambassadors for both Presidents Bush were not Cabinet officers, while they were under Reagan, and subsequently under Clinton and Obama.\nJohn Kelly Sworn In as Secretary of Homeland Security\n*\nWith Secretary Kelly atop DHS, our borders will be secure and our laws will be enforced.\n*\nHis four decades of exemplary military service have prepared him well to fight the growing threat of terrorism.\n*\nUnder Secretary Kelly’s leadership at DHS:\n*\nAmerica will be a tolerant and open society.\n*\nAmerica will be a safe society.\n*\nWe will protect our borders.\n*\nWe will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.\nSCOTUS\n*\nThe President intends to nominate an Associate Justice to the United States Supreme Court next Thursday.\n*\nThis will be one of the most important decisions he makes – impacting generations of Americans – and he is taking it very seriously.\n*\nThe individuals under consideration were selected, first and foremost, because of their commitment to constitutional principles, with input from respected conservative leaders.\n*\nA significant number of voters considered the Supreme Court the most important issue of the election. Those voters overwhelmingly supported President Trump, and he is going to deliver a worthy successor to Justice Scalia.\n*\nDemocrat attempts to block the President’s nominee would mean they’re casting aside the will of the public when a significant part of it voted based on this issue.\n*\nJustice Scalia was a brilliant and remarkable Supreme Court Justice. He never legislated from the bench, always upheld the Constitution, and protected Americans’ most cherished freedoms.\n*\nThe next Supreme Court Justice will embody the ideals and principles that defined Justice Scalia’s career, and will represent the constitutional principles the President values.\nVoter Fraud\n*\nAs you saw from his tweet, the President is looking into various options to address voter fraud.\n*\nOn Thursday, while in Philadelphia for the Congressional Republicans retreat, he will also provide an update on actions he may be taking to that end.\n*\nThe concept of “one person, one vote” is a hallmark of our democracy, it’s so important to maintain the integrity of our voting process.\n*\nThe President has stated before his concerns about voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign - this is a belief he maintains and is based on studies and evidence that has been brought before him.\nExecutive Actions on Trade and Jobs\n*\nPipelines\n*\nPresidential Memorandum for the Keystone XL Pipeline\n*\nThis memorandum fulfills a campaign promise:  inviting TransCanada to re-submit their Keystone pipeline proposal and directing agencies to swiftly approve it.\n*\nThe Keystone pipeline is an $8 billion private sector investment that would create thousands of new jobs and enhance U.S. energy security. The Obama administration blocked it for political reasons.\n*\nContinuing to block the Keystone pipeline also means energy companies will transport oil with more dangerous, less environmentally friendly, and more expensive methods.\n*\nPresidential Memorandum for the Dakota Access Pipeline\n*\nA strong energy pipeline infrastructure is key for America’s energy independence, national security, and economic growth.\n*\nThis memorandum directs agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining portions of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Obama stalled.\n*\nThis $3.8 billion pipeline will carry 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the U.S. It it is already almost 90% complete.\n*\nInfrastructure\n*\nExecutive Order – High Priority Infrastructure Projects\n*\nThis Executive Order establishes a framework for expediting environmental reviews for high priority infrastructure projects.\n*\nIt also delays and other inefficiencies in the environmental review and permitting process are severely impeding critically important projects to rebuild and modernize our nation’s infrastructure.\n*\nAll too often, projects of critical importance to our nation’s infrastructure get tied-up in bureaucratic red-tape. This Order will help put an end to those delays.\n*\nExecutive Order – Project Labor Agreements\n*\nThis EO revokes an Obama EO that encouraged requiring Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) on federal construction projects. This EO instead requires neutrality toward PLAs.\n*\nFederal contracts should go to whoever offers the best value for taxpayer dollars – whether they are unionized or not.\n*\nPLA mandates waste taxpayers’ money. They raise construction costs by one-sixth.\n*\nPLA mandates discriminate against non-union workers.  PLAs require hiring through union hiring halls and following union work rules. This can make it very difficult for non-union workers to get work on federal projects.\n*\nRegulatory Streamlining\n*\nExecutive Order – Environmental Justice & Urban Renewal\n*\nA 1994 EO requires all agencies to make achieving environmental justice part of their mission.\n*\nTo help communities in the inner-cities, it is crucial to promote strong economic growth and job creation.\n*\nThis EO order updates the 1994 order to ensure that environmental justice policies are administered so as to promote, and not to discourage, urban renewal, economic revitalization, job creation, and the rebuilding of our nation’s minority and low-income communities.\n*\nPresidential Memorandum to Streamline Reviews and Reduce Regulatory Burdens for Domestic Manufacturing\n*\nManufacturers are telling the President that excessive regulations are driving them out of the U.S.\n*\nThis Memo requires the Commerce Secretary to reach out to manufacturers and the public to identify the regulations that are hurting manufacturing.\n*\nThe Commerce Secretary, working with other agencies, will then give me a report recommending how to streamline manufacturing permitting and reduce the regulatory burden on our manufacturers.\n*\nWithdrawal from TPP\n*\nThis multinational trade agreement was negotiated in secret and is not in the best interest of American workers.\n*\nThe President’s action ushers in a new era of U.S. trade policy.\n*\nHe is moving quickly to advance trade policies that increase the competitiveness of American workers and manufacturers.\n*\nWe will pursue bilateral free trade opportunities with allies around the world, wherever possible.\n*\nThe President's vision is to negotiate fair trade deals that create American jobs, increase American wages, and reduce America's trade deficit.\n*\nMexico City Policy\n*\nUnder this initiative, the United States will end the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas, along with coercive abortion and sterilization practices.\n*\nPresident Trump is committed to life -- for both the unborn and the born -- and he will pursue policies that support that commitment.\n*\nHiring Freeze\n*\nThis memorandum imposes a hiring freeze on the executive branch to counter the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years and the costs attendant to that expansion.\n*\nPresident Trump is committed to being a responsible steward of taxpayer resources.\n*\nThe Federal workforce has expanded significantly during the last two Administrations, from approximately 1.8 million Federal civilian employees during the Clinton Administration to approximately 2.1 million as of 2016 (an approximately 17 percent increase).\n*\nMeanwhile, Federal employee health and retirement benefits continue to be based on antiquated assumptions and require a level of generosity long since abandoned by most of the private sector.\n*\nThose costs are unsustainable for the Federal government, just as they are proving to be unsustainable for state and local governments with similar health and retirement packages.\n*\nObamacare\n*\nThis executive order is an emergency, stop-gap measure intended to help ObamaCare’s victims until President Trump and the Republican Congress can swiftly repeal and replace the disastrous law once and for all.\n*\nIn broad terms, it orders departments and agencies to exercise all their authority and discretion to relieve the crushing burden on Americans caused by ObamaCare.\n*\nSpecifically, this order:\n*\nAllows federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of ObamaCare elements that impose a cost, penalty or regulatory burden on American patients, doctors, hospitals, employers and other businesses.\n*\nDefers as much authority and flexibility to the States as possible, still consistent with law, to meet the healthcare needs of their citizens.\n*\nEases regulatory and other impediments to the flourishing of a free and open health care market that offers the maximum options for patients and other key stakeholders.\n*\nThe President will vigorously advocate for legislative action to broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.\n*\nThe President and congressional Republicans are taking action, putting the health and safety of the American people first, and working toward delivering on their promises.\n*\nMyth vs. Fact:\n*\nMyth: You’re taking away people’s healthcare!\n*\nFact: No, former President Obama and his party took away people’s healthcare. Millions of people have already lost their plans, or their insurance company, or their doctor. Millions more have coverage that they can’t use because their deductibles are too high. This order is merely an attempt to stop the bleeding and relieve Americans from the worst and most pressing burdens of Obamacare’s mandates, taxes and red tape.\n*\nMyth: You’re backing away from your promise to repeal and replace legislatively (with Congress).\n*\nFact: No, the House and the Senate and they are assembling the pieces of our legislative package for ObamaCare repeal and replace right now. We want to cross all the t’s and dot the i’s so that there are no mistakes and no surprises. Unlike Nancy Pelosi, we believe in knowing what’s in the bill before it passes.\nRegulatory Freeze\nTop Line:\n*\nThis memorandum freezes all regulations that were in process, but were not finalized by noon on Inauguration Day.\n*\nIt is patterned after similar memoranda issued by the incoming Chiefs of Staff of both President Bush and President Obama.\n*\nhis process helps avoid “midnight” rulemaking by the outgoing administration and ensures that the President’s appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations.\nAdditional details:\n*\nNo regulation will be sent to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) -- unless granted an exception by the Acting Director of the OMB -- until the agency head appointed by President Trump reviews and approves the regulation.\n*\nRegulation that has been sent to the OFR but not published in the Federal Register will be immediately withdrawn.\n*\nRegulations that have been published in the OFR but have not taken effect will temporarily postpone their effective date for 60 days for the purpose of review.\nCall with Prime Minister Modi\n*\nPresident Trump emphasized that the United States considers India a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world.\n*\nThe two discussed opportunities to strengthen the partnership between the United States and India in broad areas such as the economy and defense.\n*\nThey also discussed security in the region of South and Central Asia.\n*\nPresident Trump and Prime Minister Modi resolved that the United States and India stand shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism.\n*\nPresident Trump looked forward to hosting Prime Minister Modi in the United States later this year.\nFBI Director\n*\nNo decision has been made on the FBI Director’s position. An announcement will be made at the appropriate time.\nFalse Allegations Against HHS Secretary-designate Price\n*\nThe allegations being made or insinuated are completely false.\n*\nNothing that Dr. Price has done is unethical, and no one has alleged any rules were violated.\n*\nPursuant to the arrangement with his brokerage firm, the financial advisor, and not Dr. Price, has the discretion to decide which securities to buy and sell in his account.\n*\nThe President has full confidence in Dr. Price and looks forward to working with him to increase the quality and affordability of healthcare for all Americans.\nEPA/DOI Social Media Policies\n*\nTo be clear, in both cases, the White House has not directed a halt to any employee communications. Any direction has come from the agencies and is consistent with that respective agency’s social media college.\n*\nIt is within the administration’s right to request agencies temporarily cease certain media communications until new teams are in place.\n*\nThis is to prevent certain executive agencies from putting out messaging content that would conflict with the agenda the American people just voted into office.\nLegislative Agenda\n*\nSpeaker Ryan has laid out six areas Republicans in Congress plan to focus on during the current legislative session, each of which is an integral part of the President’s plan to Make America Great Again.\n*\n1. Repealing Obamacare\n*\nPresident Trump's healthcare reform agenda will broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.\n*\nHHS nominee Dr. Tom Price is the go-to expert on quality health care policy and will play an integral role in this process.\n*\n2. Regulatory relief\n*\nWe must craft a modern regulatory framework that slashes the out-of-control bureaucracy that costs our economy $2 trillion dollars each year.\n*\n3. Reforming the tax code\n*\nThe President’s pro-growth tax plan ensures every income group will receive a tax cut and low-income Americans will pay no taxes at all.\n*\n4. Securing the border\n*\nAmerica's immigration policy must prioritize the jobs, wages and security of the American people.\n*\n5. Rebuilding our military\n*\n6. Infrastructure\n*\nWe must transform America’s crumbling infrastructure into a golden opportunity for accelerated economic growth and productivity gains with a deficit-neutral plan targeting substantial new infrastructure investments.\nObamaCare Repeal and Replace\nTop Line:\n*\nUpon taking office President Trump immediately moved to ease the burden of ObamaCare via executive order in an effort to smooth the transition from repeal to replace.\n*\nHe has made it clear that ObamaCare should be repealed and replaced \"essentially simultaneously.\"\n*\nSpeaker Paul Ryan has echoed those sentiments, saying, \"We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill,\" so the President and Congressional Leadership are on the same page.\n*\nThe President will vigorously advocate for legislative action to broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.\n*\nReminder: ObamaCare passed without a single Republican vote.\n*\nDemocrats share the sole responsibility for this disastrous law, which has devolved into a death spiral of skyrocketing costs and poor coverage.\n*\nThe President and congressional Republicans are taking action, putting the health and safety of the American people first, and working toward delivering on their promises.\nAdditional background:\n*\nPresident Obama repeatedly promised that his health care policies would bring down costs, allow Americans to keep their doctors and their health plans, increase competition amongst insurers, and would not increase taxes on the middle class – all promises that he subsequently broke.\n*\nPolls show the American people think ObamaCare is failing and has hurt the health care that they and their families receive.\n*\nWith ObamaCare’s failures piling up, Democrats are starting to turn on it. Even Bill Clinton called the law a “crazy system” where people end up with “premiums doubled and coverage cut in half.”", "timestamp": "2017-01-28T00:00:00", "title": "Evening Communications Briefing - January 27, 2017"}

Trump today signed a series of Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda in keeping with his promise to reduce the burden of regulations and expedite high priority energy and infrastructure projects that will create jobs and increase national security.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline\nWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump will help fulfill the campaign promise of initiating the process for approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.\nThe Keystone XL Pipeline is an 1,100-mile crude oil pipeline to connect oil production in Alberta, Canada to refineries in the United States.\nConstruction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, as well as oil production and refining activities related to it, would create tens of thousands of jobs for American workers, enhance our nation’s energy security, support affordable and reliable energy for American families, and generate significant State and local tax revenues that can be invested in schools, hospitals, and infrastructure.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline\nWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump directed the relevant Federal agencies (including the Army Corps of Engineers) to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining portions of the Dakota Access Pipeline., a $3.8 billion, 1,100-mile pipeline designed to carry around 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the U.S.\nAt this time, DAPL is more than 90% complete across its entire route.  Only a limited stretch of the project is not yet constructed. Timely review and approval of energy pipelines is critical to a strong economy, energy independence, and national security.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of American Pipelines\nIn keeping with his commitment to “Buy American, Hire American”, President Trump directed the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with all relevant executive departments and agencies, to develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States, including portions of pipelines, use materials and equipment produced in the United States, to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.  The Secretary shall submit the plan to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum.\nPresidential Memorandum Streamlining Permitting and Reducing Regulatory Burdens for Domestic Manufacturing\nWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump helps fulfill the campaign promise of boosting domestic manufacturing by determining a plan of action for expediting approvals for manufacturing and reducing regulatory burdens.\nUnder this Presidential Memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce will conduct outreach to stakeholders and solicit comments from the public concerning Federal actions to streamline permitting and reduce regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturers.\nThe Commerce Secretary will submit a report to the President identifying recommendations to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturers. The report should identify priority actions as well as recommended deadlines for completing actions.\nExecutive Order Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals For High Priority Infrastructure Projects\nWith this Executive Order, President Trump will establish a framework for expediting environmental reviews for high priority infrastructure projects.\nDelays and other inefficiencies in the environmental review and permitting process are severely impeding critically important projects to rebuild and modernize our nation’s infrastructure, such as highways, bridges, tunnels, the electrical grid, ports, water systems, airports, railways and pipelines.\nAccording to one study, our antiquated power rigs wastes the equivalent of 200 coal-fired power plants, water pipes leak trillions of gallons of water, and gridlock on roads and railroads wastes hundreds of billions annually.", "timestamp": "2017-01-24T00:00:00", "title": "President Trump Takes Action to Expedite Priority Energy and Infrastructure Projects"}

It is the policy of the Trump Administration to represent the American people and their financial well-being in all negotiations, particularly the American worker, and to create fair and economically beneficial trade deals that serve their interests.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding the Hiring Freeze\nPresident Trump issued a memorandum which imposes a hiring freeze on the executive branch to counter the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years and the costs attendant to that expansion.\nThe Federal workforce has expanded significantly during the last two Administrations, from approximately 1.8 million Federal civilian employees during the Clinton Administration to approximately 2.1 million as of 2016 (an approximately 17 percent increase).  Meanwhile, Federal employee health and retirement benefits continue to be based on antiquated assumptions and require a level of generosity long since abandoned by most of the private sector.  Those costs are unsustainable for the Federal government, just as they are proving to be unsustainable for state and local governments with similar health and retirement packages.\nPresidential Memorandum Regarding the Mexico City Policy\nPresident Trump issued a memorandum reestablishing the Mexico City Policy.

{"source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states", "text": "The White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\nFor Immediate Release\nMarch 06, 2017\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\n- - - - - - -\nPROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Policy and Purpose.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals.  The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States.  It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.\n(b)  On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).\n(i)    Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries:  Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.  These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States.  Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.  In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security:  \"(I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.\"  8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii).  Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.\n(ii)   In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part:  \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"  8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries -- each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States -- would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.\n(iii)  Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days.  Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs.  Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees.  Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.\n(iv)   Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion.  While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion.  That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities -- whoever they are and wherever they reside -- to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.\n(c)  The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation.  Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States.  On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the \"political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions\" about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.\n(d)  Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats.  Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones.  Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States.  Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States.  Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.\n(e)  The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:\n(i)    Iran.  Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq.  Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia.  Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\n(ii)   Libya.  Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals.  In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions.  Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country.  The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters.  The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.\n(iii)  Somalia.  Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens.  Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries.  Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents.  The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.\n(iv)   Sudan.  Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas.  Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train.  Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.\n(v)    Syria.  Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979.  The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country.  At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups.  It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq.  ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States.  The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012.  Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.\n(vi)   Yemen.  Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition.  Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks.  Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities.  In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country.  Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\n(f)  In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high.  Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.\n(g)  Iraq presents a special case.  Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones.  Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq.  Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents.  Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq.  In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States.  In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal.  Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.\n(h)  Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security.  Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States.  They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees.  For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses.  And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon.  The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n(i)  Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern.  In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.\nSec. 2.  Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.\n(c)  To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.\n(d)  Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.\n(e)  After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means.  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.\n(f)  At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.\n(g)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.\nSec. 3.  Scope and Implementation of Suspension.\n(a)  Scope.  Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:\n(i)    are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;\n(ii)   did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and\n(iii)  do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.\n(b)  Exceptions.  The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:\n(i)    any lawful permanent resident of the United States;\n(ii)   any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;\n(iii)  any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;\n(iv)   any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;\n(v)    any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or\n(vi)   any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n(c)  Waivers.  Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner's delegee, may, in the consular officer's or the CBP official's discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer's satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest.  Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged.  Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:\n(i)    the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;\n(ii)    the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;\n(iii)   the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;\n(iv)    the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;\n(v)the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;\n(vi)    the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;\n(vii)   the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), 22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of an international organization not designated under the IOIA;\n(viii)  the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or\n(ix)    the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.\nSec. 4.  Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq.  An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS.  Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.\nSec. 5.  Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry.  This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.\nSec. 6.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.  During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures.  The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State.  The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n(b)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.\n(c)  Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following:  the individual's entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.\n(d)  It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.  To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\nSec. 7.  Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility.  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.\nSec. 8.  Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry exit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section.  The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit further reports every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\nSec. 9.  Visa Interview Security.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.  This suspension shall not apply to any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the IOIA; or traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government.\n(b)  To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.\nSec. 10.  Visa Validity Reciprocity.  The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements and arrangements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment.  If another country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a truly reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by that foreign country, to the extent practicable.\nSec. 11.  Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following information:\n(i)    information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national-security-related reasons;\n(ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States;\n(iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called \"honor killings,\" in the United States by foreign nationals; and\n(iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall release the initial report under subsection (a) of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this order and shall include information for the period from September 11, 2001, until the date of the initial report.  Subsequent reports shall be issued every 180 days thereafter and reflect the period since the previous report.\nSec. 12.  Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with appropriate domestic and international partners, including countries and organizations, to ensure efficient, effective, and appropriate implementation of the actions directed in this order.\n(b)  In implementing this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, as appropriate, those providing an opportunity for individuals to claim a fear of persecution or torture, such as the credible fear determination for aliens covered by section 235(b)(1)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A).\n(c)  No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order.\n(d)  Any individual whose visa was marked revoked or marked canceled as a result of Executive Order 13769 shall be entitled to a travel document confirming that the individual is permitted to travel to the United States and seek entry.  Any prior cancellation or revocation of a visa that was solely pursuant to Executive Order 13769 shall not be the basis of inadmissibility for any future determination about entry or admissibility.\n(e)  This order shall not apply to an individual who has been granted asylum, to a refugee who has already been admitted to the United States, or to an individual granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, consistent with the laws of the United States.\nSec. 13.  Revocation.  Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017, is revoked as of the effective date of this order.\nSec. 14.  Effective Date.  This order is effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern daylight time on March 16, 2017.\nSec. 15.  Severability.  (a)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or

certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements.\nSec. 16.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and

 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

foster more and better opportunities in higher education; strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education; provide equitable opportunities for HBCUs to participate in Federal programs;

or\n(iii)  the illegal concealment or transfer of proceeds derived from such illicit activities.\n(b)  ensure that Federal law enforcement agencies give a high priority and devote sufficient resources to efforts to identify, interdict, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including through the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of members of such organizations, the extradition of members of such organizations to face justice in the United States and, where appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, the swift removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are members of such organizations;\n(c)  maximize the extent to which all Federal agencies share information and coordinate with Federal law enforcement agencies, as permitted by law, in order to identify, interdict, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;\n(d)  enhance cooperation with foreign counterparts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including, where appropriate and permitted by law, through sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information and through increased security sector assistance to foreign partners by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n(e)  develop strategies, under the guidance of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to maximize coordination among agencies -- such as through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), Special Operations Division, the OCDETF Fusion Center, and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center -- to counter the crimes described in subsection (a) of this section, consistent with applicable Federal law; and\n(f)  pursue and support additional efforts to prevent the operational success of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States, to include prosecution of ancillary criminal offenses, such as immigration fraud and visa fraud, and the seizure of the implements of such organizations and forfeiture of the proceeds of their criminal activity.\nSec. 3.  Implementation.  In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, or their designees, shall co-chair and direct the existing interagency Threat Mitigation Working Group (TMWG), which shall:\n(a)  work to support and improve the coordination of Federal agencies' efforts to identify, interdict, investigate, prosecute, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States;\n(b)  work to improve Federal agencies' provision, collection, reporting, and sharing of, and access to, data relevant to Federal efforts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;\n(c)  work to increase intelligence and law enforcement information sharing with foreign partners battling transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, and to enhance international operational capabilities and cooperation;\n(d)  assess Federal agencies' allocation of monetary and personnel resources for identifying, interdicting, and dismantling transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, as well as any resources that should be redirected toward these efforts;\n(e)  identify Federal agencies' practices, any absence of practices, and funding needs that might hinder Federal efforts to effectively combat transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;\n(f)  review relevant Federal laws to determine existing ways in which to identify, interdict, and disrupt the activity of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, and ascertain which statutory authorities, including provisions under the Immigration and Nationality Act, could be better enforced or amended to prevent foreign members of these organizations or their associates from obtaining entry into the United States and from exploiting the United States immigration system;\n(g)  in the interest of transparency and public safety, and in compliance with all applicable law, including the Privacy Act, issue reports at least once per quarter detailing convictions in the United States relating to transnational criminal organizations and their subsidiaries;\n(h)  to the extent deemed useful by the Co-Chairs, and in their discretion, identify methods for Federal agencies to coordinate, as permitted by law, with State, tribal, and local governments and law enforcement agencies, foreign law enforcement partners, public-health organizations, and non-governmental organizations in order to aid in the identification, interdiction, and dismantling of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;\n(i)  to the extent deemed useful by the Co-Chairs, and in their discretion, consult with the Office of National Drug Control Policy in implementing this order;

methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section.  The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements.\nSec. 3.  Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget.  (a)  Beginning with the Regulatory Plans (required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, or any successor order) for fiscal year 2018, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the head of each agency shall identify, for each regulation that increases incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 2(c) of this order, and provide the agency's best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.\n(b)  Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order.\n(c)  Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included on the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director.\n(d)  During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for the next fiscal year.  No regulations exceeding the agency's total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director.  The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost.\n(e)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section.\nSec. 4.  Definition.  For purposes of this order the term \"regulation\" or \"rule\" means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, but does not include:\n(a)  regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, or foreign affairs function of the United States;\n(b)  regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or\n(c)  any other category of regulations exempted by the Director.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States.  The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.  The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.  In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \"honor\" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\nSec. 3.  Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.\n(c)  To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).\n(d)  Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.\n(e)  After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.\n(f)  At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.\n(g)  Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.\n(h)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.\nSec. 4.  Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.\nSec. 5.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days.  During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures.  Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures.  Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n(b)  Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.  Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.\n(c)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n(d)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.\n(e)  Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.\n(f)  The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n(g)  It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.  To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\nSec. 6.  Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility.  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.\nSec. 7.  Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section.  The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order.  Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\nSec. 8.  Visa Interview Security.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.\n(b)  To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.\nSec. 9.  Visa Validity Reciprocity.  The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment.  If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.\nSec. 10.  Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:\n(i)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;\n(ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n(iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n(iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\n(b)  The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.\nSec. 11.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

(INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States.  Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety.  Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States.  The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.\nTransnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs.  Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct.  Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.\nFederal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border.  Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws - and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders - the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility.  The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to:\n(a)  secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;\n(b)  detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;\n(c)  expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;\n(d)  remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed;\n(e)  cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.\nSec. 3.  Definitions.  (a)  \"Asylum officer\" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).\n(b)  \"Southern border\" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.\n(c)  \"Border States\" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.\n(d)  Except as otherwise noted, \"the Secretary\" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n(e)  \"Wall\" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.\n(f)  \"Executive department\" shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.\n(g)  \"Regulations\" shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.\n(h)  \"Operational control\" shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.\nSec. 4.  Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States.  The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:\n(a)  In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\n(b)  Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\n(c)  Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\n(d)  Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\nSec. 5.  Detention Facilities.  (a)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\n(b)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.\n(c)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.\nSec. 6.  Detention for Illegal Entry.  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law.  The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as \"catch and release,\" whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.\nSec. 7.  Return to Territory.  The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.\nSec. 8.  Additional Border Patrol Agents.  Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.\nSec. 9.  Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements.  The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.\nSec. 10.  Federal-State Agreements.  It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n(a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).\n(b)  To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary.  Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.\n(c)  To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.\nSec. 11.  Parole, Asylum, and Removal.  It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.\n(a)  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.\n(b)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.\n(c)  Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).\n(d)  The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.\n(e)  The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.\nSec. 12.  Authorization to Enter Federal Lands.  The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:\n(a)  permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement this order; and\n(b)  enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to implement this order.\nSec. 13.  Priority Enforcement.  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern border.\nSec. 14.  Government Transparency.  The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily understandable by the public.\nSec. 15.  Reporting.  Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order.\nSec. 16.  Hiring.  The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.\nSec. 17.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Immediate Release\nJanuary 25, 2017\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\n- - - - - - -\nENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE INTERIOR OF THE\nUNITED STATES\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to ensure the public safety of the American people in communities across the United States as well as to ensure that our Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby declare the policy of the executive branch to be, and order, as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States.  Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety.  This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.\nSanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States.  These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.\nTens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation.  Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails.  The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.\nAlthough Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility.  We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.  The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to:\n(a)  Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;\n(b)  Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;\n(c)  Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;\n(d)  Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and\n(e)  Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.\nSec. 3.  Definitions.  The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.\nSec. 4.  Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States.  In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.\nSec. 5.  Enforcement Priorities.  In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:\n(a)  Have been convicted of any criminal offense;\n(b)  Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;\n(c)  Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;\n(d)  Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;\n(e)  Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;\n(f)  Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or\n(g)  In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\nSec. 6.  Civil Fines and Penalties.  As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States.\nSec. 7.  Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers.  The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357).\nSec. 8.  Federal-State Agreements.  It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n(a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).\n(b)  To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary.  Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.\n(c)  To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction.\nSec. 9.  Sanctuary Jurisdictions.  It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.\n(a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.  The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction.  The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.\n(b)  To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\n(c)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction.\nSec. 10.  Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies.  (a)  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as \"Secure Communities\" referenced in that memorandum.\n(b)  The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law.\n(c)  To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies.\nSec. 11.  Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators.  The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States.\nSec. 12.  Recalcitrant Countries.  The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate.  The Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States.\nSec. 13.  Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens.  The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims.  This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.\nSec. 14.  Privacy Act.  Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.\nSec. 15.  Reporting.  Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order within 90 days of the date of this order and again within 180 days of the date of this order.\nSec. 16.  Transparency.   To promote the transparency and situational awareness of criminal aliens in the United States, the Secretary and the Attorney General are hereby directed to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports on the following:\n(a)  the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons;\n(b)  the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated as Federal pretrial detainees under the supervision of the United States Marshals Service; and\n(c)  the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States.\nSec. 17.  Personnel Actions.  The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate and lawful action to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.\nSec. 18.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its

Purpose. Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American families and consumers. Too often, infrastructure projects in the United States have been routinely and excessively delayed by agency processes and procedures. These delays have increased project costs and blocked the American people from the full benefits of increased infrastructure investments, which are important to allowing Americans to compete and win on the world economic stage. Federal infrastructure decisions should be accomplished with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, while also respecting property rights and protecting public safety and the environment. To that end, it is the policy of the executive branch to streamline and expedite, in a manner consistent with law, environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially projects that are a high priority for the Nation, such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.\nSec. 2. Identification of High Priority Infrastructure Projects. With respect to infrastructure projects for which Federal reviews and approvals are required, upon request by the Governor of a State, or the head of any executive department or agency (agency), or on his or her own initiative, the Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall, within 30 days after a request is made, decide whether an infrastructure project qualifies as a \"high priority\" infrastructure project. This determination shall be made after consideration of the project's importance to the general welfare, value to the Nation, environmental benefits, and such other factors as the Chairman deems relevant.\nSec. 3. Deadlines. With respect to any project designated as a high priority under section 2 of this order, the Chairman of the CEQ shall coordinate with the head of the relevant agency to establish, in a manner consistent with law, expedited procedures and deadlines for completion of environmental reviews and approvals for such projects. All agencies shall give highest priority to completing such reviews and approvals by the established deadlines using all necessary and appropriate means. With respect to deadlines established consistent with this section that are not met, the head of the relevant agency shall provide a written explanation to the Chairman explaining the causes for the delay and providing concrete actions taken by the agency to complete such reviews and approvals as expeditiously as possible.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(c) All actions taken pursuant to this order shall be consistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods. Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.\n(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

and\n(b)  ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary to rigorously evaluate all grounds of inadmissibility or deportability, or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.\nSec. 3.  Enforcement of All Laws for Entry into the United States.  I direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of all other relevant executive departments and agencies (as identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security) to rigorously enforce all existing grounds of inadmissibility and to ensure subsequent compliance with related laws after admission.  The heads of all relevant executive departments and agencies shall issue new rules, regulations, or guidance (collectively, rules), as appropriate, to enforce laws relating to such grounds of inadmissibility and subsequent compliance.  To the extent that the Secretary of Homeland Security issues such new rules, the heads of all other relevant executive departments and agencies shall, as necessary and appropriate, issue new rules that conform to them.  Such new rules shall supersede any previous rules to the extent of any conflict.\nSec. 4.  Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To ensure that the American people have more regular access to information, and to ensure that the executive branch shares information among its departments and agencies, the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, issue regular reports regarding visas and adjustments of immigration status, written in non-technical language for broad public use and understanding.  In addition to any other information released by the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security:\n(i)   Beginning on April 28, 2017, and by the last day of every month thereafter, the Secretary of State shall publish the following information about actions taken during the preceding calendar month:\n(A)  the number of visas that have been issued from each consular office within each country during the reporting period, disaggregated by detailed visa category and country of issuance; and\n(B)  any other information the Secretary of State considers appropriate, including information that the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may request be published.\n(ii)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue reports detailing the number of adjustments of immigration status that have been made during the reporting period, disaggregated by type of adjustment, type and detailed class of admission, and country of nationality.  The first report shall be issued within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, and subsequent reports shall be issued every 90 days thereafter.  The first report shall address data from the date of this memorandum until the report is issued, and each subsequent report shall address new data since the last report was issued.\n(b)  To further ensure transparency for the American people regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of our immigration programs in serving the national interest, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, submit to me a report detailing the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs.\n(c)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, produce a report estimating how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long-term cost as supporting refugees in the United States, taking into account the full lifetime cost of Federal, State, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  All actions taken pursuant to this memorandum shall be consistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods, personally identifiable information, and the confidentiality of visa records.  Nothing in this memorandum shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.\n(d)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(e)  The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

my highest priority is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.  In order to advise and assist me in executing this solemn responsibility, as well as to protect and advance the national interests of the United States at home and abroad, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development and decision-making shall be organized as follows:\nA.The National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Supporting Staff\nThe National Security Act of 1947, as amended, established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.  There is also a Homeland Security Council (HSC) -- established through Executive Order 13228 of October 8, 2001, and subsequently codified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 -- that has the purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security.  Each Council is also responsible for the effective coordination of the security-related activities and functions of the executive departments and agencies.\nThe security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries.  Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative.  Both Councils are statutory bodies that the President will continue to chair.  Invitations to participate in specific Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue or issues under consideration.  When the President is absent from a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President's direction.\nThe Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (Homeland Security Advisor) shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President's direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC or HSC, respectively, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared, and recording Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner.  When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy shall perform these tasks in concert.\nThe NSC and HSC shall have as their regular attendees (both statutory and non-statutory) the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations.  When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the NSC's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.  The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings.  The Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are invited as attendees to any NSC meeting.\nIn addition to the NSC and HSC, there is also a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President that serves both the NSC and HSC.  The staff is composed of regional, issue-focused, and functional directorates and headed by a single civilian Executive Secretary, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 3021, who is also the Chief of Staff.  All policy and staff activity decisions will be transmitted to the Executive Secretary for appropriate distribution and awareness.  The purpose of the NSC staff is to advise me, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, the NSC members, the HSC members, and others in the White House; to facilitate the implementation of Administration policy; and to help coordinate the national-security-related activities of the executive departments and agencies.\nB. The Principals Committee\nThe Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States.  The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor or the Homeland Security Advisor, as appropriate, in consultation with the appropriate attendees of the PC.  The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the appropriate committee members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner.  Invitations to participate in or attend a specific PC shall be extended at the discretion of the National Security Advisor and the Homeland Security Advisor, and may include those Cabinet-level heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue under consideration.\nThe PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the National Security Advisor, and the Homeland Security Advisor.  The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.  The Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all PC meetings.\nThe Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor (Deputy National Security Advisor), the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the Executive Secretary (who shall serve as the Executive Secretary of the PC) shall attend all of the meetings of the PC, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations and the Assistant to the President for Intragovernmental and Technology Initiatives may attend as appropriate.\nWhen international economic issues are on the agenda of the PC, the Committee's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (who shall serve as Chair for agenda items that principally pertain to international economics).\\\nC. The Deputies Committee\nThe Deputies Committee (DC) shall continue to serve as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of, and where appropriate, decision-making on, policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States.  The DC shall be convened and chaired by the Deputy National Security Advisor or the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor (Deputy Homeland Security Advisor), as appropriate.  The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the regular DC members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner.  Invitations to participate in or attend a specific DC meeting shall be extended by the Chair to those at the Deputy or Under Secretary level of executive departments and agencies, and to other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue under consideration.\nThe DC shall have as its regular members the Deputy Secretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Attorney General, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, the Deputy National Security Advisor, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.\nThe Executive Secretary shall attend the DC meetings.  The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs may attend all DC meetings.  The relevant Deputy Assistant to the President for the specific regional and functional issue under consideration shall also be invited to attend.  Likewise, when and where appropriate, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communication, the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Transnational Issues, and the Deputy Representative of the United States to the United Nations, shall also be invited to attend.  Other senior officials shall be invited where appropriate.\nThe DC shall review and monitor the work of the interagency national security process, including the interagency groups established pursuant to section D below.  The DC shall help to ensure that issues brought before the NSC, HSC, and PC have been properly analyzed and prepared for decision.  The DC shall also focus significant attention on monitoring the implementation of policies and decisions and shall conduct periodic reviews of the Administration's major national security and foreign policy initiatives.  The DC is responsible for establishing Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) and for providing objectives and clear guidance.\nD. Policy Coordination Committees\nManagement of the development and implementation of national security policies by multiple executive departments and agencies typically shall be accomplished by the PCCs, with participation primarily occurring at the Assistant Secretary level.  As the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordination of national security policies, the PCCs shall provide policy analysis for consideration by the more senior committees of the national security system and ensure timely responses to the President's decisions.\nRegional and issue-related PCCs shall be established at the direction of the DC.  Members of the NSC staff (or National Economic Council staff, as appropriate) will chair the PCCs; the DC, at its discretion, may add co-chairs to any PCC.  The PCCs shall review and coordinate the implementation of Presidential decisions in their respective policy areas.  The Chair of each PCC, in consultation with the Executive Secretary, shall invite representatives of other executive departments and agencies to attend meetings of the PCC where appropriate.  The Chair of each PCC, with the agreement of the Executive Secretary, may establish subordinate working groups to assist that PCC in the performance of its duties.\nAn early meeting of the DC will be devoted to establishing the PCCs, determining their memberships, and providing them with mandates and strict guidance.  Until the DC has established otherwise, the existing system of Interagency Policy Committees shall continue.\nE. General\nThe President and the Vice President may attend any and all meetings of any entity established by or under this memorandum.\nThis document is part of a series of National Security Presidential Memoranda that shall replace both Presidential Policy Directives and Presidential Study Directives as the instrument for communicating relevant Presidential decisions.  This memorandum shall supersede all other existing Presidential guidance on the organization or support of the NSC and the HSC.  With regard to its application to economic matters, this document shall be interpreted in concert with any Executive Order governing the National Economic Council and with Presidential Memoranda signed hereafter that implement either this memorandum or that Executive Order.\nThe Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

and\n(F)  a detailed strategy to robustly fund the Plan.\n(b)  Participants.  The Secretary of Defense shall develop the Plan in collaboration with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\n(c)  Development of the Plan.  Consistent with applicable law, the Participants identified in subsection (b) of this section shall compile all information in the possession of the Federal Government relevant to the defeat of ISIS and its affiliates.  All executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly comply with any request of the Participants to provide information in their possession or control pertaining to ISIS.  The Participants may seek further information relevant to the Plan from any appropriate source.\n(d)  The Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register\nDONALD J.

Anthony, the publisher and editor of The Revolution and her friend, Dr. Charlotte Lozier, one of the first women medical doctors in the United States, both of whom advocated for the dignity and equality of women, pregnant mothers, and their children; Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat accelerated the modern civil rights movement; Shirley Temple Black, the famous actress turned diplomat and first chief of protocol for the President of the United States; Anna Bissell, the first woman CEO in American history; Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean; Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song and the Queen of Jazz; and Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut.\nAmerica will continue to fight for women's rights and equality across the country and around the world.  Though poverty holds back many women, America cannot and will not allow this to persist.  We will empower all women to pursue their American dreams, to live, work and thrive in safe communities that allow them to protect and provide for themselves and their families.\nAmerica is also mindful of the fight that continues for so many women around the world, where women are often not protected and treated disgracefully as second-class citizens.  America will fight for these women too, and it will fight to protect young girls who are robbed of their rights, trafficked around the world, and exploited.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

Mancini, Acting Administrator\nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs\nSUBJECT:   Spring 2017 Data Call for the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions\nThis memorandum and its attachment contain guidelines and procedures for publishing the Spring 2017 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (“Unified Agenda”) (see “Attachment,” infra). Publication of the Unified Agenda represents a key component of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order (“EO”) 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” 58 FR 51735 (Sept. 30, 1993), and reaffirmed in EO 13563, “Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,” 76 FR 3821 (Jan. 18, 2011).\nThe complete Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. We plan to continue our practice of publishing in the Federal Register only the Unified Agenda information required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.). For further information about publication format, please refer to the attached guidelines and procedures.\nAs you design your submissions (which are due by March 31, 2017) we ask that you give especially careful attention to the principles and requirements identified in EO 13771, “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,” 82 FR 9339 (Jan. 30, 2017); EO 13659, \"Streamlining the Export/Import Process for America’s Businesses,\" 79 FR 10657 (Feb. 19, 2014); EO 13563; EO 13610, “Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens,” 77 FR 28469 (May 10, 2012); and EO 13609, “Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation,” 77 FR 26413 (May 1, 2012).\nIn particular, EO 13771 recognizes it is “the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds,” and that “it is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations.” Consistent with these principles, and with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs’ (“OIRA’s”) February 2, 2017 memorandum entitled, “Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the EO of January 30, 2017, Titled ‘Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,’” (and any successor memos), your submissions should reflect attention to the following requirements:\n*\nThe total incremental costs of any new significant regulatory actions issued between noon on January 20, 2017 and September 30, 2017 shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully offset as of September 30, 2017; and\n*\nAgencies should, for each new significant regulatory action that imposes costs and that an agency plans to issue on or before September 30, 2017, identify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before September 30, 2017.\nIn addition, we recognize that Unified Agenda submissions will likely include regulatory actions that you plan to issue in Fiscal Year 2018. Section 3 of EO 13771 states that “Beginning with the Regulatory Plans (required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, or any successor order) for fiscal year 2018, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the head of each agency shall identify, for each regulation that increases incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 2(c) of this order, and provide the agency's best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.” While OIRA recognizes that EO 13771 refers to The Regulatory Plan traditionally issued in the fall, in order to facilitate the fiscal year 2018 regulatory budget planning process we are requesting that your spring 2017 submissions include a preliminary estimate of the total costs or savings associated with each of your planned fiscal year 2018 significant regulatory actions and offsetting deregulatory actions. Such cost estimates should be consistent with OMB Circular A-4, “Regulatory Analysis,” (Sept. 17, 2003). Some of these regulatory and deregulatory actions may fall out of the 12 month reporting window for this Unified Agenda cycle: if that is that case, we nevertheless request that the agencies base this cost estimate on your best current prediction of the planned fiscal year 2018 actions. We understand that these preliminary estimates are subject to discussion and revision during the rulemaking, review, and regulatory budgeting processes. We remind agencies of EO 13771’s directives that “for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.”\nAlso, the process for designating significant regulatory actions set forth in EO 12866 has not changed and we ask that you consult with your agency’s OIRA desk officer on significance determinations for planned regulatory actions. Finally, please ensure that a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2017, or his or her delegate, has had an opportunity to review significant regulatory actions in light of these directives.\nPlease note that the immediately preceding requirements apply only to those agencies required to submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review under EO 12866, and are subject to any additional exceptions identified in EO 13771, by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or in any implementing guidance issued by OIRA. Nevertheless, we encourage independent regulatory agencies to identify existing regulations that, if repealed or revised, would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of new significant regulatory actions.\nPreparing and Transmitting Agency Unified Agenda Submissions:\nThe Attachment to this memorandum identifies the materials you will need and explains in detail how to prepare your agency’s submission for the Unified Agenda (whether you enter the information directly into the database, transmit a complete electronic file, or submit the information on paper forms). Please follow the procedures explained in the Attachment carefully and be sure to include all required documents with your submission.\nYour agency may direct any questions regarding the content of its Unified Agenda submission to the appropriate desk officer in the OIRA.\nIt is very important that your agency submits all Unified Agenda materials by March 31, 2017. Please direct your submissions and production questions, as well as requests for additional materials, to the Regulatory Information Service Center (“RISC”), General Services Administration, 1800 F Street NW., Room 2219F, Washington, DC 20405-0001, telephone (202) 482-7340.\nWays for an Agency to Make Its Unified Agenda Submission More Open and Informative to the Public:\nAs you prepare your Unified Agenda submission, please keep in mind that agencies can help achieve the objectives of open government by making clear, meaningful, and informative contributions to the Unified Agenda. By supplying accurate, timely content, you will increase the transparency and accessibility of the regulatory process, maximizing the value of these documents to the public, while also improving planning and coordination.\nThe Unified Agenda offers optional data elements for the URLs of websites with more information about a rulemaking and for submitting public comments. To help promote accessibility, we encourage you to provide relevant URLs whenever available. In addition, please include in your preamble a reference to www.regulations.gov, the government-wide website for submission of comments on proposed regulations.\nThe following are suggested steps you can take to improve your agency’s Unified Agenda:\n*\nIn recent years, a large number of Unified Agenda entries have reflected regulatory actions for which no substantial activity was expected within the coming year. Many of these entries are listed as “Long-Term.” We have retained the ability to list these items in the Agenda, and see merit in their continued inclusion, particularly in some instances of notable rulemakings for which no action is planned in the coming year. Please, however, consider whether the listing of such entries still benefits readers.\n*\nMany entries are listed with projected dates that have simply been moved forward year after year, with no action taken. Unless you realistically intend and have the resources to take action over the next 12 months, please consider removing these items from the Unified Agenda.\n*\nPlease review any Unified Agenda entries marked “Routine and Frequent” or “Informational/Administrative/Other” and consider whether these entries (1) are categorized correctly and (2) meet the criteria for inclusion in the Unified Agenda under EO 12866.\n*\nThe timetables that appear for each entry in the Unified Agenda are particularly important for public understanding of the timeframes for participation in the regulatory process. Please take all reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of timetable information.\n*\nAn overall effort to maintain the quality of agency Unified Agenda content necessarily includes an emphasis on consistency of agency data. As one example of coordinating related information, please make sure that responses for Priority, Major, Unfunded Mandates, Federalism, and Government Levels Affected are consistent within an agency.\n*\nAbstracts should inform readers of the reason the rulemaking is under development and what the agency intends to accomplish. Entries with outdated information, or abstracts that merely repeat content appearing elsewhere in the entry—such as the title, timetable, or legal authority—detract from the usefulness of the Unified Agenda, and should be avoided.\nThank you for your cooperation and prompt attention. All submissions are due by March 31, 2017.\nAttachment\nGuidelines and Procedures for the Spring 2017 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions\nWhy Is the Unified Agenda Published?\nAll executive departments and establishments subject to Executive Order (“EO”) 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” 58 FR 51735 (Sept. 30, 1993), are required by section 4(b) to publish a regulatory agenda. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (“Unified Agenda”) is a compilation of each entity’s regulatory agenda (“agency agenda”). In addition, the Unified Agenda furthers the purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.) (“RFA”); EO 13771, “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,” 82 FR 9339 (Jan. 30, 2017); EO 13132, “Federalism,” 64 FR 43255 (Aug. 4, 1999); the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. §§ 1501–04, 1531–38, 1551–56 (“UMRA”); and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, 5 U.S.C. § 601 note. A central goal of the Unified Agenda is to promote transparency and open government. In the Fall edition, the Unified Agenda also includes The Regulatory Plan, describing the most important significant regulatory and deregulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form during the upcoming year.\nWhat Regulations Should Agencies Include in Their Agendas?\nRegulatory agendas should describe all regulations under development or review during the 12 months following publication. Agencies should include, at a minimum, any plans to publish or otherwise implement an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”), a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”), or a Final Rule. Agencies may include any plans to conduct a review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 610(c) or section 5 of EO 12866. An agency need not include in its regulatory agenda those rulemaking actions that are excluded by section 3(d)(1)–(4) of EO 12866.\nAgencies have the option of including activities that will have an action beyond 12 months. However, such entries should be limited to rulemakings for which listing in the Unified Agenda will provide a benefit to users. Agency agendas also should include actions or reviews completed or withdrawn since the last Unified Agenda.\nIn What Format Will the Spring 2017 Edition of the Unified Agenda Be Published?\nThe Unified Agenda will be available online, in its entirety, at www.reginfo.gov, in a format that offers users the ability to obtain information easily from the Unified Agenda database. Publication in the Federal Register is mandated for the regulatory flexibility agendas required by the RFA, and therefore it will continue. Agency agendas printed in the Federal Register will consist of the following:\n*\nThe agency’s Unified Agenda preamble;\n*\nRules that are in the agency’s regulatory flexibility agenda, in accordance with the RFA, because they are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and\n*\nAny rules that the agency has identified for periodic review under section 610 of the RFA.\nPrinting of these entries will be limited to fields that contain information required by the RFA’s agenda requirements (5 U.S.C. § 602). Additional information on these entries will be available in the Unified Agenda published on the Internet. If an agency has no entries in the printed Federal Register version of the Unified Agenda, its preamble will not be printed. Under Federal Register regulations, GPO Access will have the same content as the printed Federal Register.\nHow Will the Printed Edition of the Unified Agenda Be Organized?\nThe portion of the Unified Agenda that will be printed in the Federal Register for Spring 2017 will, in general, follow the organizational pattern of prior editions of the Unified Agenda, displaying only the information required in the regulatory flexibility agenda, along with agency preambles. Part II of the Federal Register on the day of publication will have RISC’s Introduction to the Unified Agenda. The individual agency agendas will then appear in separate parts, organized alphabetically in four groups: Cabinet departments; other executive agencies; the Federal Acquisition Regulation, a joint authority; and independent regulatory agencies. Departments may be divided into their component agencies. If an agency has no entries in the printed Federal Register version of the Agenda, its preamble will not be printed, and the agency will not have a separate part in the Federal Register.\nEach agency’s part of the Unified Agenda begins with a preamble providing information specific to that part. RISC will provide a table of contents for each agency after the agency’s preamble. The table of contents will list the agency’s printed entries. Agencies should consider including in their Unified Agenda preambles a statement indicating that the agency’s complete regulatory agenda is available online at www.reginfo.gov. RISC provides some suggested language for this purpose in the “Unified Agenda News” section of RISC’s website.\nEach agency presents its entries, divided by sub-agency if applicable, under one of five headings according to the rulemaking stage of the entry. The stages are:\n*\nPrerule Stage—actions agencies will undertake to determine whether or how to initiate rulemaking. Such actions occur prior to an NPRM and may include an ANPRM or a review of existing regulations.\n*\nProposed Rule Stage—actions for which agencies plan to publish an NPRM as the next step in their rulemaking process or for which the closing date of the NPRM Comment Period is the next step.\n*\nFinal Rule Stage—actions for which agencies plan to publish a final rule or an interim final rule or to take other final action as the next step.\n*\nLong-Term Actions—items under development but for which the agency does not expect to have a regulatory action within the 12 months after publication of this edition of the Unified Agenda. Some of the entries in this section may contain abbreviated information.\n*\nCompleted Actions—actions or reviews the agency has completed or withdrawn since publishing its last Unified Agenda. This section also includes items the agency began and completed between issues of the Unified Agenda.\nSome agencies use Agency Sort Codes to arrange the order of their entries in the printed Unified Agenda, with the final sort by “regulation identifier number” (“RIN”). OMB has also asked agencies to include RINs in the headings of their Final and Proposed Rule Documents published in the Federal Register to make it easier for the public and agency officials to track the publication history of regulatory actions through their development.\nA bullet (•) preceding the title of an entry indicates that the entry is appearing in the Unified Agenda for the first time.\nAll entries are numbered sequentially from the beginning to the end of the printed publication. The sequence number preceding the title of each entry identifies the location of the entry in this edition. The printed Unified Agenda will not have any separate indexes.\nHow Will the Online Unified Agenda Be Organized?\nThe entire Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. The Unified Agenda will be presented in the form of a searchable database, rather than as a single document that is ordered according to a prescribed sequence. Users will be able to view an individual agency’s complete agenda. The Unified Agenda will have an alphabetical Subject Matter Index based on the Federal Register Thesaurus of Indexing Terms. Because the online Unified Agenda will not utilize sequence numbers, the Subject Matter Index will be linked to individual entries by hyperlinked RINs. Each individual entry may be viewed in its entirety.\nWhat Information Appears for Each Regulation Included in the Agency Agenda?\nAll entries in the online Unified Agenda contain uniform data elements including, at a minimum, the following information:\nTitle of the Regulation—a brief description of the subject of the regulation.\nPriority—an indication of the significance of the regulation. Agencies assign each entry to one of the following five categories of significance:\n*\nEconomically Significant—As defined in EO 12866, a rulemaking action that will have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or will adversely affect in a material way the economy; a sector of the economy; productivity; competition; jobs; the environment; public health or safety; or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. The definition of an “economically significant” rule is similar but not identical to the definition of a “major” rule under the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 801 et seq. (“CRA”). (See below.)\n*\nOther Significant—A rulemaking that is not economically significant but is considered significant by the agency. This category includes rules that the agency anticipates will be reviewed under EO 12866 or rules that are a priority of the agency head.\n*\nSubstantive, Nonsignificant—a rulemaking that has substantive impacts but is neither Significant, nor Routine and Frequent, nor Informational/Administrative/Other.\n*\nRoutine and Frequent—a rulemaking that is a specific case of a multiple recurring application of a regulatory program in the Code of Federal Regulations and that does not alter the body of the regulation.\n*\nInformational/Administrative/Other—a rulemaking that is primarily informational or pertains to agency matters not central to accomplishing the agency’s regulatory mandate but that the agency places in the Unified Agenda to inform the public of the activity.\nMajor—an indication that a rule may be “major” under the CRA, because it has resulted in or is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or meets other criteria specified in that Act. The CRA provides that the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (“OIRA”) will make the final determination as to whether a rule is major.\nUnfunded Mandates—whether the rule is covered by section 202 of UMRA. UMRA requires that, before issuing an NPRM likely to result in a mandate that may result in expenditures by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of more than $100 million in 1 year, agencies, other than independent regulatory agencies, shall prepare a written statement containing an assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the Federal mandate. If the agency believes the entry is not subject to UMRA, this data element will not be printed.\nLegal Authority—the section(s) of the United States Code or Public Law or the EO that authorize(s) the regulatory action. Agencies may provide popular name references to laws in addition to these citations.\nCFR Citation—the part(s) or section(s) of the Code of Federal Regulations that will be affected by the action.\nLegal Deadline—whether the action is subject to a statutory or judicial deadline, the date of that deadline, and whether the deadline pertains to an NPRM, a Final Action, or some other action.\nAbstract—a brief description of the problem the regulation will address; the need for a Federal solution; to the extent available, alternatives that the agency is considering to address the problem; and potential costs and benefits of the action.\nTimetable—the dates and citations (if available) for all past steps and a projected date for at least the next step for the regulatory action. A date printed in the form mm/00/yyyy means the agency is predicting the month and year the action will take place but not the day it will occur. In some instances, agencies may indicate what the next action will be, but the date of that action is “To Be Determined.” Agencies indicate this by entering a date in the form 00/00/0000. “Next Action Undetermined” indicates the agency does not know what action it will take next.\nFor every entry that is not a completion, it is important that you provide in the Timetable section an estimated date for the “Next Action”—the first action scheduled to occur on or after—or indicate “Next Action Undetermined.”\nRegulatory Flexibility Analysis Required—whether the RFA requires an analysis because the rulemaking action is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Act.\nSmall Entities Affected—the types of small entities (businesses, governmental jurisdictions, or organizations) on which the rulemaking action is likely to have an impact as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agencies have the option of indicating likely effects on small entities even though they believe that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will not be required.\nGovernment Levels Affected—whether the action is expected to affect levels of government and, if so, whether the governments are State, local, tribal, or Federal.\nInternational Impacts—whether the regulation is expected to have international trade and investment effects, or otherwise may be of interest to our international trading partners.\nFederalism—whether the action has “federalism implications” as defined in EO 13132. This term refers to actions “that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.” If the action does not have federalism implications, this data element will not be printed. Independent regulatory agencies are not required to supply this information.\nAgency Contact—the name and phone number of at least one person in the agency who is knowledgeable about the rulemaking action. The agency may also provide the title, address, fax number, e-mail address, and TDD for each agency contact.\nSome agencies have provided the following optional information:\nAdditional Information—any information that the agency wants to provide for which there is not a specific data element.\nAgency Sort Codes—alternative or additional criteria for the order in which RINs are published within an agency’s agenda, as requested and specified by the agency.\nCompliance Cost to the Public—the estimated gross compliance cost of the action.\nAffected Sectors—the industrial sectors that the action may most affect, either directly or indirectly. Affected Sectors are identified by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.\nEnergy Effects—an indication of whether the agency plans to prepare or has prepared a Statement of Energy Effects for significant energy actions, as required by EO 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,” 66 FR 28355 (May 18, 2001).\nRelated RINs—one or more past or current RIN(s) associated with activity related to this action, such as merged RINs, split RINs, new activity for previously completed RINs, or duplicate RINs.\nRelated Agencies—any other agencies participating in this action if it is a joint rulemaking or common rule.\nRFA Section 610 Review—an indication that the agency has selected the rule for its periodic review of existing rules under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. § 610(c)). Some agencies have indicated completions of section 610 reviews or rulemaking actions resulting from completed section 610 reviews.\nURLs—if available, enter a URL for a website that provides the public with more information about the rulemaking and a URL for a website on which the public can submit comments on the rulemaking. If the agency does not provide its own specific website for submission of comments, then you should enter the Government-wide e-rulemaking address: http://www.regulations.gov.\nThe data elements printed for an entry appearing in the Federal Register (other than The Regulatory Plan entries in Fall editions) will be limited to the information required by the RFA. These elements are: Title; Section 610 Review, if applicable; Legal Authority; Abstract; Timetable; Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required; Agency Contact; and Regulation Identifier Number (RIN). In Fall editions, all entries in The Regulatory Plan are printed in full in the Federal Register.\nHow Should an Agency Prepare Its Data for Publication in the Unified Agenda?\nAgencies participating in the Unified Agenda should submit their respective portions in the uniform format specified in the instructions of RISC. RISC edits and compiles the Unified Agenda on behalf of OIRA.\nAgencies have three alternative methods to prepare data on individual entries for publication in the Unified Agenda:\n*\nDirect Entry. The agency establishes a connection to the RISC/OIRA Consolidated Information System (ROCIS) from one or more of its own computer terminals, through an Internet browser. Agency personnel should enter data directly into the ROCIS database.\n*\nData File. An agency that stores its Unified Agenda data in its own database may choose to transmit to ROCIS all of its data in electronic files prepared according to the specific file format prescribed by RISC. Please note that to allow sufficient time for editing, it is especially important to submit data files prior to the deadline. If you are interested in data file submission, contact RISC for further information.\n*\nPaper Forms. Agencies that cannot use direct entry or submit a data file may choose to submit their Unified Agenda entries on paper forms. The RISC staff will key the data into ROCIS. For entries that will appear for the first time, please use only the Spring 2017 edition of the Regulatory Information Data Form. You can print copies of this form from http://reginfo.gov/public/jsp/regform/download.jsp. To update entries that appeared in the 2016 Unified Agenda, you should submit marked copies of Agenda Review Reports that you have obtained from RISC.\nReports. ROCIS provides agencies with two main reports: The Agenda Review Report, which is a printout of the agency’s entries, and the Error Report, which lists inaccurate or missing data. These reports may be run for all of an agency’s entries, for entries updated since a specified date, or for a particular RIN or set of RINs. For each agency that prepares its agenda by direct entry or data file, ROCIS provides the agency’s agenda contact staff the ability to generate and print out these reports on the agency’s own printers. Please use the Agenda Review Report to review the content of your submission; you should use the Error Report to help you correct any errors and supply any missing data.\nPreambles. If you are designating section 610 reviews in the Unified Agenda, your preamble should include a reference to section 610 reviews. Each direct entry or data file agency must save from ROCIS to its own computer system a copy of its preamble from the preceding Unified Agenda. Please make changes in that file to update the preamble for the previous Unified Agenda (the Fall edition) and then upload the file to ROCIS. Do not cut and paste into ROCIS. Print the preamble file you are uploading for the required, signed copies of preambles (see below).\nFor further information about these procedures, please contact RISC.\nWhat Documents and Information Should an Agency Submit?\nEach agency should submit the following documents and information to RISC:\n*\nOne signed original and two certified copies of the preamble to its Unified Agenda entry. (Please note that the signature is required to be that of the person whose name and title are typed in the document’s signature block. One person may not sign for another person.) The preamble must meet the normal requirements for printing in the Federal Register, including a list of CFR chapters pertaining to the agency.\n*\n(For agencies that use direct entry or data file) When the agency is satisfied that its entries are complete, accurate, and represent what the agency wishes to publish, a designated person at the agency will be able to submit the entries to RISC electronically through ROCIS.\n*\n(Only for agencies that choose to submit their data on paper forms) A paper copy of the agency’s agenda entries. New entries should be on Regulatory Information Data Forms. Repeating entries should be on marked copies of Agenda Review Reports that the agency has obtained from RISC.\n*\nA letter addressed to the Office of the Federal Register (see sample letter) authorizing RISC to assemble the agency’s agenda and authorizing the Government Printing Office (“GPO”) to bill the agency for printing its portion of the Unified Agenda. The letter should include the agency’s billing code and be delivered to RISC at 1800 F Street, NW., Room 2219F, Washington, DC 20405-0001, telephone (202) 482-7340.\nIn addition, agencies may also identify rules or actions they would like to be considered as pending. A pending rule or action is one the agency does not plan to take action on in the coming calendar year, and does not want to include as a notable “Long-Term” action in the Unified Agenda itself. For internal agency tracking and overall transparency, we understand that it can be important to retain consistent RINs over time; identifying a rule or action as pending allows the agency to preserve the existing RIN for that rulemaking so that the RIN is available to the agency in subsequent Unified Agenda publication cycles.\nWhen and How Should Agencies Submit Their Agendas?\nThe deadline for submission of all completed agenda materials is March 31, 2017. This is a firm deadline.\nAgencies should submit the applicable forms and other required documents to RISC.\nRISC will then assemble the entire Unified Agenda and arrange for online publication at www.reginfo.gov. RISC will also ensure that all agency regulatory flexibility agendas are compiled and forwarded to GPO for printing in a single day’s issue of the Federal Register.\nGPO will bill each agency for the cost of printing its portions of the Unified Agenda that appear in the Federal Register. Because the Unified Agenda is submitted by RISC to GPO for publication in a fully coded format, agencies receive the maximum discount from GPO’s regular charges.\nHow Can Agencies Obtain Further Information?\nFor further information concerning the content requirements of agency agendas, contact your agency’s OIRA desk officer.\nFor further information concerning automated agenda production, specific data requirements, format, completion, or submission of agency agendas, contact the Regulatory Information Service Center, 1800 F Street NW, Room 2219F, Washington, DC 20405-0001; telephone (202) 482-7340.", "timestamp": "2017-03-06T00:00:00", "title": "Memorandum: Spring 2017 Data Call for the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions"}

Please share this with policy officials in your agency.\nAdherence to the requirements ofthe clearance process serves the needs ofthe President by ensuring that agency legislative proposals and recommendations, as well as testimony, are consistent with his policies and programs. We request that agency legislative proposals, letters, and testimony discussing or involving legislation be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as far in advance ofa needed clearance as feasible.\nOMB runs a clearance process on these items, which requires sufficient time to review and coordinate with all relevant agencies, and offices in the Executive Office ofthe President.\nOMB Circular No. A-19 details the requirements and procedures for legislative coordination and clearance. The attachment summarizes the major elements and the essential purposes ofthe clearance process.\nWe will be working with you to ensure the timely transmittal to Congress of legislative proposals necessary to support the President's legislative agenda and the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget. As decisions are made on these matters, we will be in contact about details related to the drafting, review, and clearance ofthese proposals.\nThank you for your cooperation.\nTHE LEGISLATIVE CLEARANCE FUNCTION\nThis paper summarizes the major elements of the legislative clearance function that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), working with other offices in the Executive Office ofthe President (EOP) and with the agencies, carries out on behalf of the President.\nBackground\nThe President's legislative responsibilities are founded in his constitutional duties and powers. In executing his executive duties, the President generally outlines legislative recommendations through the Inaugural address, State ofthe Union address, Budget, Economic Report, and other communications. The compilation ofthese recommendations constitutes the President's Program. In supporting the President's Program, agencies within the Administration: (1) submit to the Congress legislative proposals needed to carry out the President's Program; (2) convey the Administration's views on legislation that the Congress has under consideration; and\n(3) recommend approval or disapproval ofbills passed by the Congress.\nOMB's legislative clearance function allows for all affected agencies to engage and reconcile differences on legislative proposals and communications that are cleared and transmitted to the Congress. The primary goals of the clearance process are to ensure that: (1) agencies' legislative communications with Congress are consistent with the President's policies and objectives; and\n(2) the Administration \"speaks with one voice\" regarding legislation. During clearance, OMB circulates items to affected agencies and EOP offices for their review, and ensures that all issues are resolved before providing final clearance to the transmitting agency.\nItems that are Subject to the Clearance Process\nLegislative Proposals -All draft legislation that Executive branch agencies wish to transmit to the Congress must be sent to OMB for clearance. OMB circulates the draft bills, along with any other supporting documents, to affected agencies and appropriate EOP offices.\nAny agency reviewing a draft bill may respond that it: (1) supports or has no objection to the draft bill; or (2) proposes substantive or technical amendments, or even a complete substitute. OMB facilitates reconciliation ofdivergent views. Most disagreements are resolved through discussions at the staff level by OMB, other EOP offices, and the agencies.\nAfter obtaining appropriate policy guidance on a draft bill and resolving all issues, OMB advises the proposing agency ofclearance. OMB directs the originating agency to convey the draft bill, a transmittal letter, and a sectional analysis to the Congress. Ifthe draft bill is contrary to or conflicts with the Administration's objectives, clearance is withheld and OMB advises the proposing agency that it may not transmit the bill.\nTestimony and Letters on Pending Legislation -Congressional committees often invite agency officials to testify on pending legislation on behalf ofthe Administration, or request that agencies submit their views through a letter. Agencies may also choose to submit a letter on pending legislation without a congressional request. Such testimonies and letters must be submitted to\nOMB for clearance. OMB circulates legislative testimonies and letters to affected agencies for\ntheir review and resolves of any issues.\nOther Legislative Communications -All transmittals to Congress communicating legislative views or recommendations must be submitted to OMB for clearance. In addition to testimonies and letters, an agency may communicate in another form, such as submitting talking points to convey comments (often informally) on a bill under consideration by Congress, or responding to questions for the record following a congressional hearing. Also, agencies have numerous requirements to submit certain reports to Congress, and reports that contain any legislative views or recommendations must be submitted to OMB for clearance.\nStatements ofAdministration Policy (SAPs) -SAPs allow the Administration to state publicly its views on legislation for the record. Generally, the House releases a weekly schedule that provides notice ofbills that will be considered the following week. The Senate schedule is ascertained informally. OMB coordinates with lead agencies and other EOP entities to prepare SAPs. Once drafted, SAPs are circulated to agencies for review and comment. Once cleared, a SAP is sent to the Congress by OMB's Legislative Affairs Office, and OMB publishes the SAP on its public website. Due to the timing between the notice and congressional action, SAPs are often cleared under tight time constraints. Agencies should anticipate hard deadlines on SAP review requests.\nEnrolled Bills -Once a bill passes the House and Senate it is then enrolled and sent to the President for action --either approval or disapproval. With regard to the timing ofpresidential action, the Constitution permits the President ten days from receipt ofthe enrolled bill to take action (including holidays but excluding Sundays). This ten-day clock begins on the day after the bill is received.\nTo assist the President in deciding his course of action on a bill, OMB requests that each stakeholder agency submit its recommendation for the President's action on the bill. OMB requests a formal views letter from the lead agency or agencies. This letter must be signed by the head ofthe agency or another Presidential appointee. All formal enrolled bill views letters must specifically provide a recommendation as to whether the President should approve/sign or disapprove/veto the enrolled bill. OMB also requests views from other affected agencies, which may be provided informally. OMB prepares a memorandum to the President for each enrolled bill which includes a summary ofthe bill, analysis of significant provisions in the bill, and agency and OMB recommendations for Presidential action on the bill. Any agency recommending disapproval of a bill or the issuance of a signing statement must submit for clearance a statement for the President.", "timestamp": "2017-02-28T00:00:00", "title": "Memorandum: For the Heads of Departments and Agencies"}

Mancini, Acting Administrator\nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs\nSUBJECT:   Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, Titled “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs”\nI. General Requirements\nThis interim guidance, in the form of Questions and Answers (Q&As), addresses the requirements in Section 2, “Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2017,” of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, titled “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs” (EO). Specifically, the guidance explains, for purposes of implementing Section 2 in Fiscal Year 2017, the following requirements:\n*\n”Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency . . . publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.” Sec. 2(a).\n*\n“For fiscal year 2017, . . .the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . . . .” Sec. 2(b).\n*\n“In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.” Sec. 2(c).\nIn general, executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) may comply with those requirements by issuing two “deregulatory” actions (described below) for each new significant regulatory action that imposes costs. The savings of the two deregulatory actions are to fully offset the costs of the new significant regulatory action.\nIn addition, beginning immediately, agencies planning to issue one or more significant regulatory action on or before September 30, 2017, should for each such significant regulatory action:\n*\nA reasonable period of time before the agency issues that action, identify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before September 30, 2017; and\n*\nFully offset the total incremental cost of such new significant regulatory action as of September 30, 2017.\nPlease consult with your Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Desk Officer if you have any particular questions regarding the applicability or interpretation of the EO not addressed in these Q&As. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans to issue further guidance regarding the application of EO for Fiscal Years 2018 and beyond soon. In addition, OMB may revise these Q&As.\nComments on this interim guidance should be provided to reducingregulation@omb.eop.gov by February 10, 2017.\nII. Coverage\nQ: Which new regulations are covered?\nA: The EO’s requirements for Fiscal Year 2017 apply only to those significant regulatory actions, as defined in Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, an agency issues between noon on January 20 and September 30, 2017. This includes significant final regulations for which agencies issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking before noon on January 20, 2017. Significant guidance documents may also be covered (see below).\nPlease continue to follow the standard significance determination process outlined in Executive Order 12866. Regulations that affect only other Federal agencies (and not the public); that are issued with respect to a military, national security, or foreign affairs function of the United States; and that are related to agency organization, management, or personnel are not subject to Section 2’s requirements.\nQ: What about rules that implement Federal spending programs?\nA: In general, Federal spending rules that primarily cause income transfers from taxpayers to program beneficiaries (e.g., rules associated with Pell grants and Medicare spending) are considered “transfer rules” and are not covered by this EO. However, in cases where these rules impose requirements on non-Federal entities, such as reporting or recordkeeping, agencies would need to account for these costs. Please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer on these rules. See OMB Circular A-4 for a discussion of the distinction between transfers and costs generally.\nQ: Do Section 2’s requirements apply to significant regulatory actions of independent agencies?\nA: No, the requirements of Section 2 apply only to those agencies required to submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review under EO 12866. Nevertheless, we encourage independent regulatory agencies to identify existing regulations that, if repealed or revised, would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of new significant regulatory actions.\nQ: Are new guidance/interpretive documents covered?\nA: New significant guidance or interpretive documents will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Consult with your OIRA Desk Officer before issuing new significant guidance or regulatory interpretations. Agencies should continue to adhere to OMB’s 2007 Memorandum on Good Guidance Practices. As always, agencies should ensure that such documents are the appropriate vehicle for the particular policy goal, and that it is clear that compliance with any agency guidance is voluntary. Any cost savings claimed for guidance or other documents must be specific and verifiable.\nQ: Which existing regulatory actions, if repealed or revised, would be considered deregulatory actions, and thus qualify for savings?\nA: Any existing regulatory action that imposes costs and the repeal or revision of which will produce verifiable savings may qualify. Meaningful burden reduction through the repeal or streamlining of mandatory reporting, recordkeeping or disclosure requirements may also qualify. Agencies should also confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives after the deregulatory action is undertaken. Please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer regarding information collections or other actions you believe should qualify as deregulatory actions under Section\nQ: Do regulatory actions issued before January 20 that are vacated or remanded by a court after that date qualify for savings?\nA: Generally no, based on the presumption that a court determined these regulatory actions were issued, at least in part, with insufficient legal basis. There may be individual cases, however, where we would consider counting such savings, and specifically request comment on this topic. As one example, the agency may be directed by a court, under remand, to modify a rule through full notice and comment rulemaking, in order address particular issues.\nQ: Do regulatory actions overturned by subsequently enacted laws qualify for savings?\nA: Generally yes. We will consider Acts of Congress that overturn final regulatory actions, such as disapprovals of rules under the Congressional Review Act, to operate in a similar manner as agency deregulatory actions for the purposes of the requirements of Section 2 of the EO.\nIII. Accounting Questions\nQ: How should costs be measured?\nA: Costs should be measured as the opportunity cost to society. OMB Circular A-4 defines this concept.\nQ: How should agencies account for deregulatory actions that do not outright repeal existing regulations but revise existing requirements to produce real cost savings?\nA: OMB will address deregulatory actions that continue to allow agencies to meet regulatory goals on a case-by-case basis. Purely deregulatory actions that confer only savings to all affected parties generally will not trigger the requirement under Section 2(a) for the agency to identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed. However, if such deregulatory actions impose costs on individuals or entities, agencies will need to offset those costs.\nQ: Can effects such as future energy cost savings for rules that require the adoption of more energy efficient technologies be counted against the compliance costs of a regulatory action for purposes of Section 2(b) of the EO?\nA: In most circumstances, such effects would not be counted as offsets to costs according to OIRA’s reporting conventions for benefit-cost analysis.\nQ: What about costs that occur over different time periods?\nA: All costs estimates should be annualized in accordance with OMB Circular A-4. While timing issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis, in general, the start and end points for the annualization of costs should be directly comparable across the new and corresponding repealed regulatory actions.\nQ: Can agencies use previously estimated costs from an original Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIA) in determining the cost savings generated by an eliminated regulatory action?\nA: In general, no. While the original RIA may have information that will be useful in calculating cost savings, the most current information available on projected cost savings (e.g., new information on the cost of operating compliance technologies) must be included to the extent feasible. Agencies are also strongly encouraged to use program evaluations and similar techniques to determine the actual cost and other effects of eliminating regulatory actions.\nQ: What costs of existing regulatory actions should be counted as cost savings from a deregulatory action?\nA: All costs that would have occurred after the effective date of the repeal of the existing regulatory action should be the basis for the cost savings estimate. This means, for example, that agencies should not count sunk costs.\nQ: How should costs that duplicate those in another regulatory action be addressed?\nA: In general, costs should be counted only once, in the regulatory action that imposes the legally binding requirement resulting in those costs. Exceptions should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with your OIRA Desk Officer.\nQ: How should agencies treat unquantified costs and cost savings?\nA: These will be handled on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, the weight assigned to unquantified effects will depend on their significance and degree of certainty. See OMB Circular A-4 for more information on unquantified costs.\nIV. Process and Waiver Questions\nQ: Which significant regulatory actions might qualify for individual waivers?\nA: Emergencies addressing critical health, safety, or financial matters, or for some other compelling reason, may qualify for a waiver from some or all of the requirements of Section 2. Please submit requests for a waiver assessment to your OIRA Desk Officer prior to submitting the rule for OMB review under EO 12866.\nNote that Section 2(b) of EO applies “unless otherwise required by law.” Agencies may proceed with significant regulatory actions that need to be finalized in order to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline even if they are not able to identify offsetting regulatory actions by the time of issuance. In the unlikely case where your agency believes other regulatory actions, which are not needed to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline, are required by law, please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer. In all cases, however, agencies should identify additional regulatory actions to be repealed in order to offset the cost of the new significant regulatory action, even if such action is required by law.\nQ: Can regulatory and deregulatory actions be bundled in the same regulatory action?\nA: Yes, under certain circumstances. In practice, many regulatory actions can both impose new requirements and remove or streamline existing requirements on the same regulated entities and within the same regulatory program. In this case, the agency must clearly identify the specific provisions that are counted within the regulatory and deregulatory portion of the rules, and the costs and cost savings associated with each. The net cost impact (the difference between costs imposed and cost savings) of such rules will generally determine whether they are regulatory actions that need to be offset. Agencies, however, should avoid artificially bundling provisions that are not logically connected in a single regulatory action.\nQ: What must agencies do to “identify” existing regulatory actions to be repealed?\nA: At a minimum, the agency should identify all of the associated regulatory actions to be repealed, along with cost saving estimates, no later than the date of issuance of the corresponding new significant regulatory action. Agencies should confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives (such as health or environmental protection). All of the regulatory actions slated for repeal but not yet finalized also must be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda.\nQ: Do deregulatory actions have to be finalized before new regulatory actions can be finalized?\nA: Per Section 2(a), each agency must identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed. For many significant regulatory actions, the most appropriate place for such an identification is in the preamble of the rule being issued for notice and comment or promulgated. To the extent feasible, regulatory actions should be eliminated before or on the same schedule as the new regulatory action they offset. In cases where finalizing an offsetting regulation is not possible, agencies should provide a plan for finalizing the offsetting regulation. The most appropriate place for such a plan is the preamble of the rule being issued. The plan should include a commitment to include the offsetting regulation in the next addition of the Unified Regulatory Agenda, with dates for any required regulatory actions and estimates of the associated cost savings.\nQ: How does this EO interact with other EOs and guidance addressing regulatory activities?\nA: All requirements under other EOs and implementing guidance (e.g., EO 12866 and OMB Circular A-4) remain applicable.\nQ: Can savings be transferred within an agency?\nA: Yes. The requirements of this EO apply agency-wide. Regulatory savings by a component in one agency can be used to offset a regulatory burden by a different component in that same agency.\nQ: Can savings be transferred from other agencies?\nA: Agencies that are not able to generate sufficient savings to account for new regulatory actions they must issue may submit a written request to the Director of OMB to transfer savings from another agency before they submit a regulatory action for review that does not contain the needed offset. However, if the Director does not concur with this request, the Agency must identify adequate offsets absent a waiver.\nQ: How does the regulatory cost cap in Section 2 of the EO affect the consideration of regulatory benefits or other requirements under EO 12866?\nA: The regulatory cost cap has no effect on the requirements of EO 12866 or the consideration of regulatory benefits in making regulatory decisions. The goal of the requirement to eliminate two existing regulatory actions for each new significant regulatory action is to provide a mechanism for agencies to identify and repeal outdated, ineffective, or unnecessary regulatory actions. Similar to fiscal spending caps, the goal of the regulatory cost cap is to provide a mechanism for the prudent management and control of regulatory costs imposed on society by agencies attempting to achieve regulatory benefits.", "timestamp": "2017-02-02T00:00:00", "title": "Memorandum: Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, Titled “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs”"}

Res. 37 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Defense, the General\nServices Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Relating\nto the Federal Acquisition Regulation\n(Rep. Foxx, R-NC, and 3 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America’s businesses. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act have established burdensome compliance requirements that force jobs out of our communities and discourage doing business in the United States. The House is also considering overturning a Social Security Administration Rule that would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits.\nH.J. Res. 38 would nullify the Stream Protection Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 93066 (Dec. 20, 2016), a final rule recently promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The bill disapproves a rule that would establish onerous requirements for coal mining operations, and impose significant compliance burdens on America’s coal production. The disapproved rule also duplicates existing protections in the Clean Water Act and is unnecessary given the other Federal and State regulations already in place. The Administration is committed to reviving America’s coal mining communities, which have been hurting for too long.\nH.J. Res. 36 would nullify the final rule Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation. 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (Nov. 18, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. The bill disapproves an expensive rule that would require oil and gas producers to reduce natural gas waste and emissions, regardless of whether or not it is economically viable to do so. The majority of affected oil and gas operators are small businesses, and productive wells could be unnecessarily shut in to meet the requirements of this rule. While minimizing waste remains an important component of responsible energy development, the Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on American businesses, supporting energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans, maximizing the use of American resources, and freeing us from dependence on foreign oil.\nH.J. Res. 41 would nullify the final rule Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, 81 Fed. Reg. 49359 (July 27, 2016), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bill disapproves a rule that would require resource extraction issuers to report payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals. In some cases, the rule would require companies to disclose information that the host nation of their project prohibits from disclosure or is commercially sensitive. The rule would impose unreasonable compliance costs on American energy companies that are not justified by quantifiable benefits. Moreover, American businesses could face a competitive disadvantage in cases where their foreign competitors are not subject to similar rules.\nH.J. Res. 40 would nullify the final rule Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (Dec. 19, 2016), promulgated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The bill disapproves a rule that would allow SSA to provide records on certain individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act or Supplemental Security Income payments under title XVI of the Social Security Act to the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The rule would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits. Applications of this rule could endanger the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens.\nH.J. Res. 37 would nullify the rule Federal Acquisition Regulation; Fair Pay and Safe Workspaces, 81 Fed. Reg. 58562 (August 25, 2016). The bill disapproves a rule that would require federal contractors to disclose findings of non-compliance with labor laws. The rule would bog down Federal procurement with unnecessary and burdensome processes that would result in delays, and decreased competition for Federal government contracts. Rolling back this rule will also help to reduce costs in Federal procurement. The Administration is committed to reducing onerous regulatory burdens on America's businesses and using existing authorities to continue enforcing the Nation's workplace laws.\nIf these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.", "timestamp": "2017-02-01T00:00:00", "title": "H.J.

This memorandum provides additional guidance regarding the freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees as directed by the President on January 23, 2017, via Presidential Memorandum (PM) entitled \"Hiring Freeze.\" This guidance is in addition to the initial implementation guidance issued by the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on January 25, 2017. This guidance provides information on the types of exemptions authorized under this hiring freeze as well as instructions on how departments and agencies can request exemptions from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for critical situations where additional exemptions may be warranted.\n*\nCoverage. This memorandum applies to all Executive departments and agencies regardless of the sources of their operational and programmatic funding and to all types of Federal civilian appointments, regardless of the length of the appointment, except as provided for below or otherwise provided in law. No vacant positions existing at noon on January 22, 2017, may be filled and no new positions may be created, except in limited circumstances. For the purposes of this memorandum, a position is not considered vacant if an individual has been given an offer of employment prior to noon on January 22, 2017, has accepted the position, and has a designated start date on or before February 22, 2017.\nContracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of the PM shall not be permitted. For example, agencies shall not acquire by contract with a commercial vendor services that are substantially similar to those that would have been provided by a Federal civilian in a vacancy covered by the PM. However, nothing in this memorandum is intended to restrict agencies from continuing, modifying, or entering into service contracts for other purposes, consistent with law, regulation, and any applicable management direction.\nThe guidance in this memorandum should be implemented consistent with any lawful collective bargaining obligations that may apply.\n*\nExemptions. The following exemptions to the Federal civilian hiring freeze are permitted:\n*\nMilitary personnel in the armed forces and all Federal uniformed personnel, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Commissioned Officer Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n*\nFilling of positions under programs where limiting the hiring of personnel would conflict with applicable law.\n*\nNomination and appointment of officials to positions requiring Presidential appointment, with or without Senate confirmation.\n*\nAppointment of officials to non-career positions in the Senior Executive Service or to Schedule C appointments in the Excepted Service, or the appointment of any other officials who serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority (i.e., \"appointed\" positions of a political/non-career nature).\n*\nAppointment of seasonal employees and short-term temporary employees necessary to meet traditionally recurring seasonal workloads, provided that the agency informs its OMB Resource Management Office in writing in advance of its hiring plans.\n*\nHiring by the U.S. Postal Service.\n*\nFederal civilian personnel hires made by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n*\nAppointments made under the Pathways Internship and Presidential Management Fellows programs (this does not include the Recent Graduates program). Agencies should ensure that such hires understand the provisional nature of these appointments and that conversion is not guaranteed.\n*\nConversions in the ordinary course to the competitive service of current agency employees serving in positions with conversion authority, such as Veteran's Recruitment Act (VRA) and Pathways programs.\n*\nAppointments made under 5 C.F.R. § 213.3102(r) (time limited positions in support of fellowship or professional/industry exchange programs) provided that the total number of individuals employed under this authority does not exceed the number of employees onboard (hired under this authority) on January 22, 2017.\n*\nPlacement of persons with restoration rights accorded by law, such as restoration after absence with injury compensation and restoration after military duty.\n*\nJob offers made prior to January 22, 2017, for which the individual has a confirmed start date on or before February 22, 2017. Those individuals should report to work according to their respective designated start dates.\n*\nJob offers made prior to January 22, 2017, but for which the individual has a confirmed start date that is later than February 22, 2017 (or does not have a confirmed start date), should be decided on a case-by-case basis and must go through an agency-head review. The agency head should review each position to determine whether the job offer should be revoked, or whether the hiring process should continue. Agency heads should consider essential mission priorities, current agency resources, and funding levels when making determinations about whether or not to revoke job offers.\n*\nInternal career ladder promotions.\n*\nReallocations (i.e., noncompetitive reassignments and details) of current Federal civilian employees within an agency to meet the highest priority needs (including preservation of national security and other essential services) are not affected. Details (reimbursable and non-reimbursable) between agencies are also not affected; however, agency leadership should ensure that any reimbursable details between agencies are not being used to circumvent the intent of the hiring freeze.\n*\nTerm and temporary appointments of existing Federal employees may be extended up to the maximum allowable time limit, consistent with the conditions/requirements of the legal authority originally used to appoint the employee.\n*\nA limited number of voluntary transfers of current SES between agencies, as necessary to secure the leadership capacity of agencies, and where needs cannot be met by reallocation of resources within an agency's current workforce; however, filling of such vacancies is subject to OPM approval in accordance with section 4 below.\n*\nThe head of any agency may exempt any positions that it deems necessary to:\n*\nMeet national security (including foreign relations) responsibilities, or\n*\nMeet public safety responsibilities (including essential activities to the extent that they protect life and property). Agencies may refer to longstanding guidance, which provides examples of such activities in OMB Memorandum. Agency Operations in the Absence of Appropriations. dated 11/17/1981 [see examples 3(a) to 3(k)].\nAgency heads should consult with appropriate personnel, including the agency Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) or equivalent and agency counsel when determining what positions to exempt from the hiring freeze. Agency heads are also required to consult with OPM and the agency's OMB Resource Management Office on their intent to exempt positions using their agency head authority before implementing these exemptions. Note that in the case of an Inspector General's (IG) office, the Inspector General is considered the agency head for the purposes of determining which positions in the IG office are exempt based on the definitions above, as well as for the purposes of the agency-head review of job offers in the IG office that either do not have a start date or have a designated start date beyond February 22, 2017.\n*\nExemptions Granted by the Director of OPM. The Director of OPM may grant additional exemptions from the hiring freeze for critical situations. Accordingly, if an agency head assesses that circumstances warrant additional exemptions to the hiring freeze other than those specified above, a request must be made in writing to the Director of OPM and signed by the agency head. The request must:\n*\nExplain the critical need and how it relates to essential services or critical mission requirements.\n*\nExplain why reallocation (reassignment/detail) of existing staff within the agency is not possible to meet the needs outlined in the request.\n*\nExplain the urgency of the need and the consequences of not filling the position within a 3 to 6 month timeline.\nAgencies must also notify their respective OMB Resource Management Office of exemption requests to OPM under this provision.\n*\nEffective Dates. The guidance in this memorandum is effective immediately. Within 90 days of the publication of the PM issued on January 23, 2017, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Director of OPM, shall recommend a long-term plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through attrition. The hiring freeze will expire upon implementation of the OMB plan.\n*\nInquiries. Questions from departments and agencies regarding the instructions and guidance in this memorandum should be addressed to agency OMB Resource Management Officers and OPM contacts provided to Chief Human Capital Officers and HR Directors.", "timestamp": "2017-01-31T00:00:00", "title": "Memorandum: Federal Civilian Hiring Freeze Guidance"}

The purpose of this initial guidance is to clarify immediate actions to be taken by Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies to implement the PM while further guidance is being finalized. As stated in the PM, the freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees is to be applied to all executive branch departments and agencies regardless of the sources of their operational and programmatic funding, excepting military personnel.\nFurther guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB} and/or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM} (including further details on exemptions, potential reporting requirements, and other instructions) is forthcoming.

Where appropriate and as permitted by applicable law, you should consider proposing for notice and comment a rule to delay the effective date for regulations beyond that 60 day period. In cases where the effective date has been delayed in order to review questions of fact, law, or policy, you should consider potentially proposing further notice-and-comment rulemaking.\nYour agency staff has identified or should promptly identify regulation[1] that have been published in the Federal Register but have not yet taken effect. For such regulations, paragraph 3 of the Freeze Memo instructs your agency to undertake several actions.\nFirst, absent applicable exceptions (discussed below), postpone for 60 days the effective dates of regulations that have been published but have not yet taken effect for the purpose of reviewing questions of fact, law, and policy \"as permitted by applicable law.\" To the maximum extent possible, your explanations for postponement should be individualized to the regulation being postponed. In addition, the Administrative Procedure Act generally establishes procedural requirements for agencies promulgating rules, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions. Please consult with your agency's Office of General Counsel as you implement the Freeze Memo and this Memorandum.\nSecond, consider postponing the effective date beyond 60 days where appropriate. If such a postponement is appropriate, seek comment on the extended postponement, in accordance with the Freeze Memo.[2] If your agency takes comment on the initial 60-day postponement, e.g., by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, consider using the same action to take comment on an extended postponement. In addition, please consider taking comment on the regulation itself, including about questions of fact, law, and policy that the agency should recognize as it considers whether the regulation raises any substantial questions.\nFinally, if during your review you determine a regulation raises no substantial question of fact, law, or policy, please provide your Office of lnformation and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Desk Officer a list of such regulations on which you plan to take no further action no later than two weeks prior to the postponed effective date for those regulations. Alternately, if you determine a regulation raises a substantial question of fact, law, or policy, please notify your OIRA Desk Officer promptly and consider whether you agency should perform additional rulemaking or take other further actions. If your agency determines it should take further actions, please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer in accordance with the Freeze Memo.\nActions Related to the Federal Register and OIRA\nSubject to any exceptions, withdraw all regulations that have been sent to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) but have not yet been published. This will allow review of those regulations as the Freeze Memo envisions. To facilitate such withdrawals, please see an example withdrawal letter in Appendix A.\nNote that the OFR's specific requirements for the withdrawal of documents depend on whether those documents have been filed for public inspection. Some of those requirements are particularly time sensitive. Specifically, for those regulations that have been filed for public inspection but not published, Chapter 4.3 of the Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook requires the following for withdrawals:\nIf we have filed the document for public inspection, your [Federal Register] Liaison Officer may withdraw it from publication only by submitting a letter requesting the withdrawal .... An official with authority to sign Federal Register documents or the Liaison Officer must sign this letter.\nThe Liaison Officer must e-mail the OFR at fedreg.liaison@nara.gov as soon as possible to confirm that the letter has been sent. In addition:\nThe letter must reach the OFR during regular office hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. ET) before noon on the workday before the document's scheduled publication date. We will not withdraw the document until we receive your letter.\nThus, if it has not already done so, your agency should submit withdrawal letters to the OFR as soon as possible.\nIn addition, subject to any exceptions, send no further regulations to the OFR until an agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2017, reviews and approves the regulations.[3] Also, consistent with the Freeze Memo's direction to comply with applicable Executive Orders (EOs) concerning regulatory management, please continue to follow the process outlined in EO 12866 to determine whether any such approved regulation is significant and therefore subject to OIRA review.\nFinally, consistent with the Freeze Memo's broad scope, and to ensure that OIRA reviews only those regulations that have already been reviewed by the appropriate person at each agency, I am requesting that your agency withdraw any regulations currently at OIRA.\nExceptions\nThere are two exceptions to the above directions. First, exclude from those actions any regulations \"subject to statutory or judicial deadlines.\" These are regulations where performing the otherwise required review actions would endanger compliance with an operative statutory or judicial deadline. For example, agency civil monetary penalty adjustments that were due this month [4] and were not significant regulatory actions under EO 12866 likely fall within this exception. After you have identified such regulations, please contact your OIRA Desk Officer with a list of those regulations as well as a brief explanation of your determination that provides a reference to the statutory or judicial deadline.\nSecond, the Freeze Memo authorizes the Director or Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget to make exceptions from the Freeze Memo's requirements under paragraphs 1-3 \"for emergency situations or other urgent circumstances relating to health, safety, financial, or national security matters, or otherwise.\" Please send your OIRA Desk Officer a list of such regulations, if any; the type of regulatory action each regulation is; which paragraphs of the Freeze Memo those regulations should be excepted from; and a brief explanation for each such regulation of the emergency situation or urgent health, safety, financial, national security, or other matter that forms the basis of the requested exception. The Office of Management and Budget will review your justification promptly and provide further guidance.\nApplicability\nAs used in this Memorandum, \"regulation\" has the meaning given to \"regulatory action\" in section 3( e) of EO 12866, and also includes any \"guidance document\" as defined in section 3(g) of EO 12866 as it existed when EO 13422 was in effect.

The legislation would prohibit any funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law to be expended for any abortion, or for direct payments to insurers for health benefits coverage that includes coverage for abortions. H.R. 7 also would prohibit the purchase of abortion coverage with matching funds from federally subsidized programs, including Federal and State Medicaid funds. The legislation would not relate to the treatment of any complication caused by or worsened by an abortion, nor to the treatment of abortions in the case of rape, incest, or preserving the life of the mother. This bill would continue to prohibit the Federal government from paying for affected procedures with the taxes of Americans who find abortion morally or religiously objectionable.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 7 in its present form, he would sign the bill.", "timestamp": "2017-01-24T00:00:00", "title": "H.
