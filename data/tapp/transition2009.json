Today, we face challenges like never before in our lifetime. A lot of folks here in DC and across America are hurting and filled with uncertainty about what the future holds. And as I prepare to take that oath tomorrow, I know my Administration has our work cut out for us.\nBut I also know this: that however well government does its job; however hard we work to make good plans and policies and restore a sense of responsibility to Washington, our problems cannot be solved by government alone – or even mostly by government. It's going to take all of us, putting our shoulder to the wheel, doing our part to remake this nation.\nThat's why we've called on the American people to come together and devote their time and effort to work in their communities today. And that's why we chose this particular day, when we honor a man who lived his life as a servant to his fellow citizens – and whose greatness can be measured not just in his own extraordinary contributions, but in how he inspired others to contribute.\nDr. King taught us that we could no longer view our own day-to-day cares and responsibilities as somehow separate from what was happening in the wider world that we read about in the newspaper and saw on TV. Because ultimately, for each of us, our own story and the American story are not separate, they are shared. And they are both strengthened and enriched each time we stand up and answer the call to help meet the challenges of our new century.\nSo today, I am asking you to roll up your sleeves and join in the work of remaking this nation. I pledge to you that government will do its part to open up more opportunities for citizens to participate. And in return, I ask you to play your part – to not just pitch in today, but to make an ongoing commitment that lasts far beyond one day, or even one presidency.\nAnd to those who are skeptical about whether this will happen – to anyone who thinks that the American people are selfish or apathetic – I invite them to come here to Coolidge High School and to the more than 11,000 other places across this country where people have spent today fixing up schools and renovating homes and organizing food drives and blood drives and so much more. I see what the American people are doing today and every day. So don't tell me that we can't usher in a new spirit of service in this country.\nI know we can do this. America is a great nation precisely because Americans have been willing to stand up when it was hard; to give when they had little left to give; to rise above moments of great challenge and terrible trial.\nAnd I know that I am here today – as are so many of you – because somebody, at some point, decided that loving their community and their country meant doing something to change it.\nThat's what we are called to do once again, in this moment – our moment – in history. So today, in the words of Dr. King, \"Let us rise up…with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be.\"\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2009-01-19", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect at the Day of Service Luncheon at Coolidge High School"}

His was a vision that all Americans might share the freedom to make of our lives what we will; that our children might climb higher than we would.\nDr. Martin Luther King's was a life lived in loving service to others. As we honor that legacy, it's not a day just to pause and reflect - it's a day to act. Today, ordinary citizens will gather together all across the country to participate in the more than eleven thousand service projects they've created using USAservice.org. And I ask the American people to turn today's efforts into an ongoing commitment to enriching the lives of others in their communities, their cities, and their country.\nTomorrow, we will come together as one people on the same mall where Dr. King's dream echoes still. As we do, we recognize that here in America, our destinies are inextricably linked. We resolve that as we walk, we must walk together. And as we go forward in the work of renewing the promise of this nation, let's remember King's lesson - that our separate dreams are really one.", "timestamp": "2009-01-19", "title": "Statement by the President-Elect on Martin Luther King Day"}

And then, according to the rules agreed to by both parties, John will have approximately thirty seconds to make a rebuttal.\nBut in all seriousness, on this night, we are glad that the days of rebuttals and campaigning are for now behind us. There is no doubt that throughout the summer and the fall, John and I were fierce competitors who engaged in a vigorous and sometimes heated debate over the issues of the day. And in a great democracy, this debate is both healthy and necessary.\nBut what is even healthier and more necessary is the recognition that after the season of campaigning has ended, each of us in public life has a responsibility to usher in a new season of cooperation built on those things we hold in common. Not as Democrats. Not as Republicans. But as Americans.\nAnd there are few Americans who understand this need for common purpose and common effort better than John McCain. It is what he has strived for and achieved throughout his life. It is built into the very content of his character.\nI could stand here and recite the long list of John's bipartisan accomplishments. Campaign finance reform. Immigration. The Patients' Bill of Rights. All those times he has crossed the aisle and risked the ire of his party for the good of his country. And yet, what makes John such a rare and courageous public servant is not the accomplishments themselves, but the true motivation behind them.\nIt has not been a quest for fame or vanity that has driven this man. It has not been the need to compromise for politics' sake that has shaped his distinguished career. It is rather a pure and deeply felt love of his country that comes from the painful knowledge of what life is like without it.\nFew of us can imagine what John endured during the days he spent in that lonely prison cell, but perhaps we can imagine that surviving such an ordeal provides a unique and renewed perspective about what is important and what is not; about what is worth fighting over and what is not.\nWe can imagine that the pettiness and bitterness and immaturity that often pervades our politics seems even more unworthy of our country from this perspective; that the incessant bickering and partisanship for the sake of scoring a few political points seems even smaller. And what seems bigger and more worthy of defending are those ideals we hold in common as Americans: liberty, equality, and opportunity.\nThose are the ideals that John has spent and risked his life fighting for, and his example is one for all of us to remember and to follow as we seek to defend those ideals against the common threats to our prosperity and our security.\nSo I'd like to thank John for all he's done and ask him to come join me on stage for a moment.\nThank you, John, for your service to America and the service you will continue to render in the months and years ahead. And I'd like to close by asking all of you to join us in making this bipartisan dinner not just an inaugural tradition, but a new way of doing the people's business in this city. We will not always agree on everything in the months to come, and we will have our share of arguments and debates. But let us strive always to find that common ground, and to defend together those common ideals, for it is the only way we can meet the very big and very serious challenges that we face right now. Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2009-01-19", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect Honoring Senator John McCain at the Bipartisan Dinner"}

And I want to thank all of you for braving the cold and the crowds and traveling in some cases thousands of miles to join us here today. Welcome to Washington, and welcome to this celebration of American renewal.\nIn the course of our history, only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now. Our nation is at war. Our economy is in crisis. Millions of Americans are losing their jobs and their homes; they're worried about how they'll afford college for their kids or pay the stack of bills on their kitchen table. And most of all, they are anxious and uncertain about the future - about whether this generation of Americans will be able to pass on what's best about this country to our children and their children.\nI won't pretend that meeting any one of these challenges will be easy. It will take more than a month or a year, and it will likely take many. Along the way there will be setbacks and false starts and days that test our fundamental resolve as a nation. But despite all of this - despite the enormity of the task that lies ahead - I stand here today as hopeful as ever that the United States of America will endure - that the dream of our founders will live on in our time.\nWhat gives me that hope is what I see when I look out across this mall. For in these monuments are chiseled those unlikely stories that affirm our unyielding faith - a faith that anything is possible in America. Rising before us stands a memorial to a man who led a small band of farmers and shopkeepers in revolution against the army of an Empire, all for the sake of an idea. On the ground below is a tribute to a generation that withstood war and depression - men and women like my grandparents who toiled on bomber assembly lines and marched across Europe to free the world from tyranny's grasp. Directly in front of us is a pool that still reflects the dream of a King, and the glory of a people who marched and bled so that their children might be judged by their character's content. And behind me, watching over the union he saved, sits the man who in so many ways made this day possible.\nAnd yet, as I stand here tonight, what gives me the greatest hope of all is not the stone and marble that surrounds us today, but what fills the spaces in between. It is you - Americans of every race and region and station who came here because you believe in what this country can be and because you want to help us get there. It is the same thing that gave me hope from the day we began this campaign for the presidency nearly two years ago; a belief that if we could just recognize ourselves in one another and bring everyone together - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents; Latino, Asian, and Native American; black and white, gay and straight, disabled and not - then not only would we restore hope and opportunity in places that yearned for both, but maybe, just maybe, we might perfect our union in the process.This is what I believed, but you made this belief real. You proved once more that people who love this country can change it. And as I prepare to assume the presidency, yours are the voices I will take with me every day I walk into that Oval Office - the voices of men and women who have different stories but hold common hopes; who ask only for what was promised us as Americans - that we might make of our lives what we will and see our children climb higher than we did.\nIt is this thread that binds us together in common effort; that runs through every memorial on this mall; that connects us to all those who struggled and sacrificed and stood here before.\nIt is how this nation has overcome the greatest differences and the longest odds - because there is no obstacle that can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.\nThat is the belief with which we began this campaign, and that is how we will overcome what ails us now. There is no doubt that our road will be long. That our climb will be steep. But never forget that the true character of our nation is revealed not during times of comfort and ease, but by the right we do when the moment is hard. I ask you to help me reveal that character once more, and together, we can carry forward as one nation, and one people, the legacy of our forefathers that we celebrate today.", "timestamp": "2009-01-18", "title": "Remarks at the Lincoln Memorial"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85438", "text": "We are here to mark the beginning of our journey to Washington. This is fitting because it was here, in this city, that our American journey began. It was here that a group of farmers and lawyers, merchants and soldiers, gathered to declare their independence and lay claim to a destiny that they were being denied.\nIt was a risky thing, meeting as they did in that summer of 1776. There was no guarantee that their fragile experiment would find success. More than once in those early years did the odds seem insurmountable. More than once did the fishermen, laborers, and craftsmen who called themselves an army face the prospect of defeat.\nAnd yet, they were willing to put all they were and all they had on the line - their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor - for a set of ideals that continue to light the world. That we are equal. That our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness come not from our laws, but from our maker. And that a government of, by, and for the people can endure. It was these ideals that led us to declare independence, and craft our constitution, producing documents that were imperfect but had within them, like our nation itself, the capacity to be made more perfect.\nWe are here today not simply to pay tribute to our first patriots but to take up the work that they began. The trials we face are very different now, but severe in their own right. Only a handful of times in our history has a generation been confronted with challenges so vast. An economy that is faltering. Two wars, one that needs to be ended responsibly, one that needs to be waged wisely. A planet that is warming from our unsustainable dependence on oil.\nAnd yet while our problems may be new, what is required to overcome them is not. What is required is the same perseverance and idealism that our founders displayed. What is required is a new declaration of independence, not just in our nation, but in our own lives - from ideology and small thinking, prejudice and bigotry - an appeal not to our easy instincts but to our better angels.\nThat is the reason I launched my campaign for the presidency nearly two years ago. I did so in the belief that the most fundamental American ideal, that a better life is in store for all those willing to work for it, was slipping out of reach. That Washington was serving the interests of the few, not the many. And that our politics had grown too small for the scale of the challenges we faced.\nBut I also believed something else. I believed that our future is our choice, and that if we could just recognize ourselves in one another and bring everyone together - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, north, south, east and west, black, white, Latino, Asian, and Native American, gay and straight, disabled and not - then not only would we restore hope and opportunity in places that yearned for both, but maybe, just maybe, we might perfect our union in the process.\nThis is what I believed, but you made this belief real. You proved once more that people who love this country can change it. And as I prepare to leave for Washington on a trip that you made possible, know that I will not be traveling alone. I will be taking with me some of the men and women I met along the way, Americans from every corner of this country, whose hopes and heartaches were the core of our cause; whose dreams and struggles have become my own.\nTheirs are the voices I will carry with me every day in the White House. Theirs are the stories I will be thinking of when we deliver the changes you elected me to make. When Americans are returning to work and sleeping easier at night knowing their jobs are secure, I will be thinking of people like Mark Dowell, who's worried his job at Ford will be the next one cut, a devastating prospect with the teenage daughters he has back home.\nWhen affordable health care is no longer something we hope for, but something we can count on, I will be thinking of working moms like Shandra Jackson, who was diagnosed with an illness, and is now burdened with higher medical bills on top of child care for her eleven year-old son.\nWhen we are welcoming back our loved ones from a war in Iraq that we've brought to an end, I will be thinking of our brave servicemen and women sacrificing around the world, of veterans like Tony Fischer, who served two tours in Iraq, and all those returning home, unable to find a job.\nThese are the stories that will drive me in the days ahead. They are different stories, told by men and women whose journeys may seem separate. And yet, what you showed me time and again is that no matter who we are or what we look like, no matter where we come from or what faith we practice, we are a people of common hopes and common dreams, who ask only for what was promised us as Americans - that we might make of our lives what we will and see our children climb higher than we did.\nWe recognize that such enormous challenges will not be solved quickly. There will be false starts and setbacks, frustrations and disappointments. And we will be called to show patience even as we act with fierce urgency.\nBut we should never forget that we are the heirs of that first band of patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew. That is the spirit that we must reclaim today.\nFor the American Revolution did not end when British guns fell silent. It was never something to be won only on a battlefield or fulfilled only in our founding documents. It was not simply a struggle to break free from empire and declare independence. The American Revolution was - and remains - an ongoing struggle \"in the minds and hearts of the people\" to live up to our founding creed.\nStarting now, let's take up in our own lives the work of perfecting our union.\nLet's build a government that is responsible to the people, and accept our own responsibilities as citizens to hold our government accountable.\nLet's all of us do our part to rebuild this country.\nLet's make sure this election is not the end of what we do to change America, but the beginning.\nJoin me in this effort. Join one another in this effort. And together, mindful of our proud history, hopeful for the future, let's seek a better world in our time.

And thank you, Wilmington, for giving us such a great send-off.\nIt was just under five months ago that Joe Biden stood beside me on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield to accept my invitation to run for Vice President of the United States of America.\nI chose Joe because I knew where he came from, even if I hadn't spent much time here -because you can learn a lot about a person's hometown through the deeds that they've done. Joe has always fought for the middle class, while forging the consensus to get things done. He has supported the cops and firefighters and families who form the backbone of our communities, while emerging as a statesman in the community of nations. And for thirty-six years, Delaware has sent Joe Biden to change Washington, and Washington hasn't changed him. Instead, Joe Biden has changed Washington.\nThe people of Delaware know this better than anyone. Because Joe is still the scrappy kid from Scranton whose family moved here - to Wilmington - in search of a new beginning. They'd known their share of hardships, and they would come to know more. They didn't have much money. But Joe Senior taught his son about the values that stretched longer than the dollar: the dignity of a hard day's work; the primacy of family; the dream that anyone should be able to make it if they try; and the simple lesson that when we Americans get knocked down, we always - always - get back up on our feet.\nThose are values that the American people hold in common. They are shared by Irish Catholics from Wilmington and African Americans from the South Side of Chicago, and by Hispanics and Asians and Native Americans all across this great land. They form a foundation for our success, and lift us up when we face adversity.\nThose are values that Joe carried with him to the Senate. You sent him there when he was just thirty, and that's when tragedy struck. Suddenly, this man who had a limitless future before him had lost more than most of us could ever imagine. That's when Joe Biden got back up on his feet.\nHe didn't move away from Delaware. Instead, day after day, month after month, year after year, he came here - to this station - and boarded the train to our nation's capital. And then, night after night, month after month, year after year, he rode that train back home in the evening to raise his boys and a beautiful family alongside his wife Jill.\nHe would be the first to tell you that he didn't do it alone - he had the people of this city and this state with him every step of the way. Now, Delaware, I'm asking Joe Biden to take one more ride to Washington.\nTogether, we know that there is work to be done. Together, we know that America faces its own crossroads - a nation at war, an economy in turmoil, an American Dream that feels like its slipping way. Together, we know that the American people are facing adversity, and that the time has come to pick ourselves up once again.\nWe have heard your stories on the campaign trail. We've been touched by your dreams. And we will fight for you every single day that we're in Washington, because Joe and I are both committed to leading a government that is accountable - not just to the wealthy or the well-connected, but to you. To the conductors who make our trains run, and to the workers who lay down the rails. To the parents who worry about how they're going to pay next month's bills on the commute to work, and to the children who hear the whistle of the train and dream of a better life.\nThat's who we're fighting for. That's who needs change. And those are the stories that we will carry with us to Washington.\nWe will carry with us the story of Mike and Cheryl Fisher. Mike is a longtime machinist whose workplace has faced the prospect of layoffs. Cheryl works as a nurse's assistant, and waits for a grandchild who is on the way. Together, they seek only to live and work and retire in the same Indiana hometown where they raised their children.\nWe will carry with us the story of Roy Gross, a truck driver from Michigan who moves cars from the plant to the showroom. Roy has watched as his friends have lost jobs while plants have shuttered their doors. He wants to see American industry build the cars of tomorrow, and jobs that let working people leave their children a better life.\nWe will carry with us the story of Quincy Lucas, a teacher from Dover, Delaware. Quincy lost her sister in a terrible act of domestic violence, and dedicated herself to ensuring that other families don't have to suffer like hers. She works with young people to stand up to violence, and is helping to build a safer and more secure community.\nThese are the quiet heroes who have made this country great. You can find them in every city and every town in all fifty states. They work hard, they look after their families, they sacrifice for their children and their grandchildren, and they deserve a government that represents the same enduring values that they live out in their own lives.\nTheirs are the stories that will drive me in the days ahead, and this is the moment that we must come together for the sake of our country. For while we come from different places, as Americans we share a common story. That story began over two centuries ago in Philadelphia, where we started today's journey, and where are forefathers declared the birth of our nation and the creation of our Constitution.\nIt was here, in Delaware, that the Constitution was first ratified. It was here, in Delaware, where the first state joined our union. Now, it falls to us to carry forward that American story, and to make it our own. Now, it falls to us to ensure that everyone in this country can make it if they try. Now, it falls to us to pick ourselves up, to reach for the promise of a better day, and to do the hard work of perfecting our union once more.", "timestamp": "2009-01-17", "title": "Address During the Inaugural Whistle Stop Tour in Wilmington, Delaware"}

More than once did the fishermen, laborers, and craftsmen who called themselves an army face the prospect of defeat.\nAnd yet, they were willing to put all they were and all they had on the line - their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor - for a set of ideals that continue to light the world. That we are equal. That our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness come not from our laws, but from our maker. And that a government of, by, and for the people can endure. It was these ideals that led us to declare independence, and craft our constitution, producing documents that were imperfect but had within them, like our nation itself, the capacity to be made more perfect.\nA few decades after the framers met in Philadelphia, our new union faced its first true test. The White House was in flames, and the British were advancing on Baltimore. That's when the fate of our nation fell to the troops at Fort McHenry. They were a varied lot, these troops: sailors, militiamen, and even a runaway slave. But on one long and rainy night, they beat back the greatest navy that the world had ever known. And when that night was over, they raised a flag in triumph, inspiring an onlooker to compose a poem that became the Star-Spangled Banner.\nWe are here today not simply to pay tribute to those patriots who founded our nation in Philadelphia or defended it in Baltimore, but to take up the cause for which they gave so much. The trials we face are very different now, but severe in their own right. Only a handful of times in our history has a generation been confronted with challenges so vast. An economy that is faltering. Two wars, one that needs to be ended responsibly, one that needs to be waged wisely. A planet that is warming from our unsustainable dependence on oil.\nAnd yet while our problems may be new, what is required to overcome them is not. What is required is the same perseverance and idealism that those first patriots displayed. What is required is a new declaration of independence, not just in our nation, but in our own lives - from ideology and small thinking, prejudice and bigotry - an appeal not to our easy instincts but to our better angels.\nThat is the reason I launched my campaign for the presidency nearly two years ago. I did so in the belief that the most fundamental American ideal, that a better life is in store for all those willing to work for it, was slipping out of reach. That Washington was serving the interests of the few, not the many. And that our politics had grown too small for the scale of the challenges we faced.\nBut I also believed something else. I believed that our future is our choice, and that if we could just recognize ourselves in one another and bring everyone together - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, north, south, east and west, black, white, Latino, Asian, and Native American, gay and straight, disabled and not - then not only would we restore hope and opportunity in places that yearned for both, but maybe, just maybe, we might perfect our union in the process.\nThis is what I believed, but you made this belief real. You proved once more that people who love this country can change it. And as I prepare to leave for Washington on a trip that you made possible, know that I will not be traveling alone. I will be taking with me some of the men and women I met along the way, Americans from every corner of this country, whose hopes and heartaches were the core of our cause; whose dreams and struggles have become my own.\nTheirs are the voices I will carry with me every day in the White House. Theirs are the stories I will be thinking of when we deliver the changes you elected me to make. When we are seeing new jobs created that pay more to those who work them, I will be thinking of people like Kevin and Kirsten Meehan, who can't afford to turn on the heat or pay rent, and are tapping into Kevin's 401k to help support their two young children.\nWhen our children are graduating from newer, better schools that prepare them to be good citizens and sought-after workers, I will be thinking of middle school teachers like Rosa Mendoza, who is giving her students the chance to fulfill their God-given potential.\nWhen quality health care is no longer something we hope for, but something we can count on, I will be thinking of people like Patricia Stiles, who was diagnosed with a serious illness just as her husband lost his pension and her kids' tuitions were coming due.\nThese are the stories that will drive me in the days ahead. They are different stories, told by men and women whose journeys may seem separate. And yet, what you showed me time and again is that no matter who we are or what we look like, no matter where we come from or what faith we practice, we are a people of common hopes and common dreams, who ask only for what was promised us as Americans - that we might make of our lives what we will and see our children climb higher than we did.\nWe recognize that such enormous challenges will not be solved quickly. There will be false starts and setbacks, frustrations and disappointments. And we will be called to show patience even as we act with fierce urgency.\nBut we should never forget that we are the heirs of those early patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew. That is the spirit that we must reclaim today.\nFor the American Revolution did not end when British guns fell silent. It was never something to be won only on a battlefield or fulfilled only in our founding documents. It was not simply a struggle to break free from empire and declare independence. The American Revolution was - and remains - an ongoing struggle \"in the minds and hearts of the people\" to live up to our founding creed.\nStarting now, let's take up in our own lives the work of perfecting our union.\nLet's build a government that is responsible to the people, and accept our own responsibilities as citizens to hold our government accountable.\nLet's all of us do our part to rebuild this country.\nLet's make sure this election is not the end of what we do to change America, but the beginning.\nJoin me in this effort. Join one another in this effort. And together, mindful of our proud history, hopeful for the future, let's seek a better world in our time.

On Tuesday, the world will be watching as America celebrates a rite that goes to the heart of our greatness as a nation. For the forty-third time, we will execute the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next.\nThe first Inauguration took place 220 years ago. Our nation's capital had yet to be built, so President George Washington took the oath of office in New York City. It was a spring day, just over a decade after the birth of our nation, as Washington assumed the new office that he would do so much to shape, and swore an oath to the Constitution that guides us to this very day.\nSince then, Inaugurations have taken place during times of war and peace; in Depression and prosperity. Our democracy has undergone many changes, and our people have taken many steps in pursuit of a more perfect union. What has always endured is this peaceful and orderly transition of power.\nFor us, it is easy to take this central aspect of our democracy for granted. But we must remember that our nation was founded at a time of Kings and Queens, and even today billions of people around the world cannot imagine their leaders giving up power without strife or bloodshed.\nThrough the ages, many have struggled for the right to live in a land where power does not belong to one person or party, and many brave Americans have fought and died to help advance that right. Through the long twilight struggle of the Cold War, our transitions from one President to the next provided a stark contrast to the suffocating grip of Soviet Communism. And today, the resilience of our democracy stands in opposition to the extremists who would tear it down.\nHere at home, transitions also remind us that what we hold in common as Americans far outweighs our political differences. Throughout the current transition, President Bush and his Administration have extended the hand of cooperation, and provided invaluable assistance to my team as we prepare to hit the ground running on January 20th.\nThere is much work to be done. But now, all Americans hold within our hands the promise of a new beginning.\nThat is why the events of the next several days are not simply about the inauguration of an American President – they will be a celebration of the American people. We will carry the voices of ordinary Americans to Washington. We will invite people across the country to work on behalf of a common purpose through a national day of service on Monday. And we will have the most open and accessible Inauguration in history – for those who travel to the capital, and for those who choose one of the many ways to participate in the Inauguration from their own communities and their own homes.\nTogether, we know that this is a time of great challenge for the American people. Difficult days are upon us, and even more difficult days lie ahead. Our nation is at war. Our economy is in great turmoil. And there is so much work that must be done to restore peace and advance prosperity. But as we approach this time-honored American tradition, we are reminded that our challenges can be met if we summon the spirit that has sustained our democracy since George Washington took the first oath of office.\nAddressing the nation that day, Washington explained his decision to serve, saying, \"I was called by my country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love.\" This Tuesday, we can reaffirm our own veneration and love for our country and our democracy. We can once again provide an example to the world, and move forward with a renewed sense of purpose and progress at home.\nThanks.", "timestamp": "2009-01-17", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85450", "text": "I want to start by thanking the folks here at Cardinal Fastener for the tour you just gave me. The story of this company – which began building wind turbine parts just two years ago, and is now poised to make half its earnings that way – is that a renewable energy economy isn't some pie-in-the-sky, far-off future. It's happening all across America right now. It's providing alternatives to foreign oil now. It can create millions of additional jobs and entire new industries if we act right now.\nThe need for this action has never been more urgent. We've started this year in the midst of a crisis unlike any we've seen in our lifetime. Last month, we lost more than half a million jobs – a total of nearly 2.6 million in 2008. Another 3.4 million people who want and need full-time work have had to settle for part-time jobs. With each passing day, families here in Ohio and across America are watching their bills pile up and their savings disappear. And economists from across the spectrum tell us that if nothing is done, and we continue on our current path, this recession could linger for years – and America could lose the competitive edge that has served as the foundation for our strength and standing in the world.\nIt's not too late to change course – but only if we take dramatic action as soon as possible. The way I see it, the first job of my Administration is to put people back to work and get our economy working again. That's why I've moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jumpstart job creation and long-term growth. And I'm pleased that Congress has seen the urgency as well, and is moving quickly to consider such a plan.\nIt's a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs in businesses large and small across a wide range of industries – and 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector. And I want to be clear – we're not looking to create just any kind of jobs here. We're looking to create good jobs that pay well and won't be shipped overseas. Jobs that don't just put people to work in the short-term, but position our economy to be on the cutting edge in the long-term.\nThat starts with new, clean sources of energy. We know that the possibilities here are limitless. Here in Ohio and across America, we've seen old factories become new clean energy producers. We've seen entrepreneurs turning solar energy into electricity, and corn and soybeans into bio-fuels. Our scientists and engineers are hard at work developing cars that use less gas, homes and appliances that require less energy, schools and offices that are greener and more efficient than ever before.\nBut we also know that we are nowhere near realizing the full potential of their work. Take the example of wind power alone: I'm told that if we don't act now, because of the economic downturn, half of the wind projects planned for 2009 could wind up being abandoned. Think about that. Think about all the businesses that wouldn't come to be, all the jobs that wouldn't be created, all the clean energy we wouldn't produce.\nAnd think of what's happening in countries like Spain, Germany and Japan, where they're making real investments in renewable energy. They're surging ahead of us, poised to take the lead in these new industries.\nThis isn't because they're smarter than us, or work harder than us, or are more innovative than we are. It's because their governments have harnessed their people's hard work and ingenuity with bold investments – investments that are paying off in good, high-wage jobs – jobs they won't lose to other countries.\nThere is no reason we can't do the same thing right here in America. That's why, as part of our Recovery and Reinvestment plan, we're committing to double the production of renewable energy in the next three years, and to modernize more than 75% of federal buildings and improve the energy efficiency of two million American homes.\nIn the process, we'll put nearly half a million people to work building wind turbines and solar panels; constructing fuel-efficient cars and buildings; and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to new jobs, more savings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain.\nHere at Cardinal Fastener, that could mean going from operating at 50 percent capacity to 90 percent capacity and creating even more good, made-in-America jobs right here in Ohio.\nWith our Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, we'll also create hundreds of thousands of jobs by improving health care – transitioning to a nationwide system of computerized medical records that won't just save money, but save lives by preventing deadly medical errors. And we'll create hundreds of thousands more jobs in education, equipping tens of thousands of schools with 21st century classrooms, labs and computers to help our kids compete with any worker in the world for any job.\nWe'll put nearly 400,000 people to work by repairing our infrastructure – our crumbling roads, bridges and schools. And we'll build the new infrastructure we need to succeed in this new century, investing in science and technology, and laying down miles of new broadband lines so that businesses across our nation can compete with their counterparts around the world.\nFinally, we won't just create jobs, we'll also provide help for those who've lost theirs, and for states and families who've been hardest-hit by this recession. That means bi-partisan extensions of unemployment insurance and health care coverage; a $1,000 tax cut for 95 percent of working families; and assistance to help states avoid harmful budget cuts in essential services like police, fire, education and health care.\nNow, given the magnitude of the challenges we face, none of this will come easy. Recovery won't happen overnight, and it's likely that, even with these measures, things will get worse before they get better.\nBut if anyone doubts that we can dig ourselves out of this hole, I invite them to come here to Ohio and look what you've done at Cardinal Fastener. I know it hasn't been easy – and it hasn't been without risk. But you've set your sights on the future, and you haven't looked back. In an economy that's losing jobs, you're creating them. And they're the kind of jobs that don't just support families and sustain communities – but also help transform our economy, spurring growth not just today, but for decades to come.\nThat's what we've always done in moments like this. We've looked ahead to the next big idea, that next new breakthrough. We've experimented and innovated, and when we've failed, we've picked ourselves up and tried again. And I know that if we can summon that determination and that great American spirit once again, we will meet the challenges of our time and build a better future for our children.", "timestamp": "2009-01-16", "title": "Remarks on an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan in Bedford Heights, Ohio"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85453", "text": "LEAHY: Good morning. Glad to see all of you familiar faces in this -- in our hearing room. I'm thinking Senator Specter and I have spent a significant portion of our lives in this -- in this room. I look around and I'm missing one of the -- one of the senators I sat here with for over 30 years, Senator Biden, who has now left the Senate for other duties of sorts.\nAnd so I welcome all of you. Yesterday, we met in the Senate Caucus Room from 9:30 to 7:15 so every senator, Republican and Democratic alike, would ask Eric Holder whatever questions they had. It's a historic room for an historic nomination.\nSenator John Warner of Virginia, once again, showed the bipartisanship and leadership he's shown for over 30 years in the Senate. He noted the problems facing the Department of Justice and the country so great that he was urging everybody to put aside partisanship and work together. He presented and endorsed Eric Holder to be attorney general, described his outstanding qualifications, integrity and independence.\nCongresswoman Norton was eloquent in her statement of support for Eric Holder, a former judge for nominated by President Ronald Reagan and then a prosecutor in the District of Columbia.\nLEAHY: So we asked -- everybody asked questions they wanted to. The senators of both parties have done so. Much of the questioning was substantive. We touched on many important issues. And the senators were -- technically, the third round was a five-minute round, but we went 20 and 25 minutes and longer for some of the senators until everybody said they'd asked all of the questions they wanted.\nHaving heard Mr. Holder's testimony, I'm more convinced than ever he's a person who will reinvigorate the Department of Justice, serve ably as a member of the president's national security team, pursue the Justice Department's vital missions with skill, integrity, independence, and a commitment to the rule of law.\nAs I said before, he's a prosecutor's prosecutor. And I'm not going use all my time because I want to get to the -- to the witnesses. But I'll yield to Senator Specter.\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The attendance is substantially less than yesterday. I can't imagine why considering the impressive array of seven witnesses who are here. But I join the chairman in that I thinking all of you for coming. And outside witnesses are we important to give a fuller picture.\nAs I said yesterday, I had hoped to have initially 12 and then down to seven and only three witnesses have been permitted here. But I don't intend to press that point because I know that there is great disdain in the American public for disagreements or bickering in Washington, D.C.\nSo the chairman and I have had a very cordial relationship for 28 years -- actually, before that. I met him when he was the district attorney of Burlington. I had a smaller city, Philadelphia.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThe district attorney. And we had the national convention in Philadelphia and I met this young fellow. He was not as tall then. He had a lot more hair.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd we have worked very closely together and we have had a disagreement about the handling of the scheduling and the handling of witnesses on a number of matters here. And I do want to help President-elect Obama. It's very important. There are enormous problems facing this country, and we all ought to do everything we can. There is the constitutional that this committee has on advice and consent. We're at the consent part now.\nAnd separation of powers is the rock bed of our republic. And independence is very important. And I have emphasized that yesterday in questioning of Mr. Holder. So we have an important role to perform here, and we appreciate your coming in.\nIn the interest of time, I'm going to yield back the balance of my two minutes and 37 seconds.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nThe first witness who was there for a good part of the hearing yesterday is Louis Freeh. Judge Freeh is the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I read this from the notes, Judge. I don't think there's anybody in the room that needs to know that, but you are. Your career began in the Department of Justice in 1975 when you became a special agent for the FBI.\nHe has a long and distinguished career as a public servant under both Democratic and Republican presidents. He will appointed by President George H.W. Bush as a federal district court judge -- a lifetime appointment in the southern district of New York. He had been a career federal prosecutor in the United States Attorney's office for the southern district of New York serving as chief of the organized crime unit.\nNow, he gave up that lifetime position to take appointment as the head of the FBI. And I -- I know -- I should note for the record I've known Louis Freeh and his wife Marilyn and family for years. And I am thrilled and I feel honored that's now a part-time resident of the state of Vermont.\nAnd, Judge, please go ahead. We will start with you and then I'll introduce each one. And if it's OK with you, I thought we'd just go through and let everybody testify and then we'll ask some questions.\nFREEH: All right.\n(Inaudible) good morning to you. It is a pleasure to be before you. I've been in front of this committee dozens and dozens of times over the years. And I'm very pleased to come here and speak in support of the nomination of Eric Holder.\nWe have presiding over the committee today not just two chairman, Senator Specter being a former chairman of the committee, but two prosecutors, two district attorneys who know firsthand the importance and the challenges of protecting our laws and our society but also adhering to the rule of law and being politically independent as you make important decisions, decisions which are subject to review and criticism.\nSo I think the country and the Senate could not have two more knowledgeable and experienced people to lead the inquiry. And I commend the committee and you, Mr. Chairman and the ranking member, for the fairness and thoroughness of your hearing.\nYou know, I was confirmed twice by this committee. I spent 25 years serving in the United States government, mostly the Department of Justice. I left the FBI director's job after eight years. One of the things I was proudest of is when I left Washington, no one in the Senate, no one in the Congress had called for my resignation while I was here. No one said I was politically partisan. No one said that I was not independent. And for me and the FBI, that was a great feeling.\nI also left town without being further investigated which, as you know, is a great benefit to any federal-serving official.\nWhen I was a prosecutor, Attorney General Thornburg, at the time, sent me down to Atlanta to work on a bombing case. It was a pretty egregious case. Someone had killed a federal judge and also the head of the NAACP in Savannah.\nThat was my first opportunity to meet Griffin Bell. Griffin Bell, in his typical humility, called me up. I was in the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta. And he said, Mr. Freeh, he said, if I can help you in any way, I know a few people in town here.\nFREEH: When he was attorney general, and you probably have heard this story, he was in his conference room, the great conference room where both of you have visited. And he was presiding over a meeting. And his secretary came out. He was a new attorney general. And she was very excited. And she said, \"General, General, the White House is on the phone.\"\nAnd he looked at her and he said in his typical Southern drawl, \"I don't take calls from buildings.\"\nThe importance of that statement, I think, is very relevant to your inquiry here and to what I want to say about Eric Holder. The attorney general of the United States is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States.\nBeyond competence, the elements of integrity, the elements of leadership, and I think most importantly, political independence is critical. Attorney generals, like district attorneys, like U.S. attorneys, like FBI directors, will make decisions from time to time with which people disagree. And that is an important facet of the service and an essential element of our democracy.\nI made many decision when I was an assistant U.S. attorney, when I was the deputy U.S. attorney, certainly, when I was an FBI director that people disagreed with. And Eric Holder has made decisions with which I disagree. And I'll talk about those briefly in a moment.\nBut it's not the decision to me as much as the process and the principles and the integrity and independence with which that decision is made. My very strong belief with respect to Eric Holder is that he has tremendous integrity. He has great character. He's got good judgment. He has excellent competence as a lawyer, which I'll talk about because I also worked with him in the private sector, as you know.\nBut he does have political independence. He's not afraid to say no, in my view, to an attorney general and now, if he's confirmed by the Senate, the president of the United States. And I think if we look at those essential characteristics and elements, we can put into better perspective decisions which we made. And as a said, some decisions which he yesterday told you he regretted and with which I also disagreed.\nThe men and women of the Department of Justice -- and I can speak, I think, for the men and women, many of them in the FBI -- have tremendous respect for Eric Holder as U.S. attorney. And as you know, when you were district attorneys, if someone wanted to really find out about what kind of a job you were doing, they would ask your assistants, they would ask the assistant district attorneys who worked for you, your chiefs. And they would give a pretty honest and pretty accurate view as to your qualities as a leader, whether or not you were strong, whether you were politically independent, whether you had the courage, the moral courage to take on difficult cases and make difficult decisions.\nAnd with respect to Eric Holder, beyond the background investigations which the FBI, of course, performed with respect to him, the agents who worked with him, particularly when he was a line assistant, had told me time and time again that he was -- he was -- he was smart. He was honest. He was fair. He was not afraid. He exercised his office without fear or favor whether he was looking at a very powerful political subject of an investigation. As you know, he did prosecute one as U.S. attorney. And he didn't pull his punches when it came to fair and thorough investigations.\nThat reputational evidence, to me, is quite essential. The federal rules of evidence allow reputational evidence to be heard by a jury because our experience has found that it's very reliable. His reputation as a good prosecutor, an honest prosecutor, and an independent prosecutor are very, very well established. I've never heard anything to dispute that. And I think that that's an essential evaluation for you to conduct.\nThe letters that you read yesterday, Mr. Chairman, you know, those endorsements are not come by very easy, in my experience. The International Association of Chiefs of Police -- I'm on one of their boards -- they don't casually or routinely endorse people. It's not a coincidence that you have all those endorsements. You have them because his reputation and the experience of the men and women who have worked with him on the line and worked with him in the Department of Justice see him and have experienced him as a good, honest, tough, and independent prosecutor.\nAnd I have another note here, Mr. Chairman, when I would submit for the record from Ron Noble who, as you know, is the director general in Interpol and assistant U.S. attorney, Senator Specter, in Philadelphia, a protege of Ed Dennis. He said he would fly over here if anybody wanted to speak to him. But he says that Eric Holder is exactly the kind of attorney that we should trust as our attorney general.\nYou know, I worked with Eric Holder probably more than anybody in this room. I saw him on a daily basis sometimes when he was deputy. We disagreed a lot. We argued over things. He would overrule me from time to time. I would challenge him occasionally, maybe more than occasionally on things. And we came out sometimes on different ends of a point or a position.\nBut in all of those dealings, what I saw was a smart, intelligent, skillful attorney, a great public servant, somebody with humility and somebody with independence who was not afraid to say no and call something as he thought it had to be called. And for me, that's very essential. Let me talk just two minutes -- not two minutes -- but briefly about the Mark Rich and the FALN matter. You know, on the Mark Rich matter, I was the deputy U.S. attorney in the southern district of New York. That was a southern district of New York case.\nOne of the things I did while I was deputy U.S. attorney is I went over to Switzerland. I actually negotiated with the Swiss to get a warrant of extradition served on Mark Rich. The pardon of Mark Rich was a corrupt act. There is no other way that I could describe it.\nAnd committees here have looked at it. They've evaluated it. It was a corrupt act. But it was not an act by Eric Holder. Let me give you just a quick picture of what was going on at the end of the Clinton administration when this pardon took place.\nNobody in the Department of Justice, nobody in the FBI had a clue about who was on the pardon list. The White House staff and its leadership, whoever was working this process, activity conspired to ensure that nobody knew what they were doing.\nOn the morning of Inauguration Day, the morning of Inauguration Day, I sent two FBI agents to stand at the west gate of the White House so they could read the list of pardoned officials when it was published because they wouldn't tell us who was being considered.\nEric Holder made some terrible mistakes, which he told you about yesterday, in allowing himself to be used and co-opted with respect to the facilitation of that pardon. But he did not understand, he did not authorize, he certainly did not execute this pardon.\nAnd he's learned a lot from that. I think, as Senator John Warner told us, we can be sure from that experience that he will never allow himself again to be put in that position.\nThe FALN pardon, you know, I wrote the letter to the Department of Justice vehemently opposed to that. The FBI took a very strong position. We were continuing FALN investigations at the time of that pardon. But the pardon process functions as a quasi judicial process. Both the pardon attorney who prepares the materials for the deputy and, ultimately, the president of the United States function in a quasi judicial manner.\nI did not agree. I do not agree with the decision with respect to that pardon. I opposed it personally. I opposed it as director. And I don't think it was a reasonable act to be done.\nBut there are many, many judicial decisions, some of which I made briefly when I was a judge, with which people disagreed. The process, however, that was followed was the process prescribed in the department and by the president. And I don't think it's fair or a good index of the character, judgment, and independence of Eric Holder to look at that without the context of 26 years of dedicated, independent, and brave leadership.\nBriefly, in private practice, you know, I hired Eric Holder when I was general counsel at MBNA Bank of America. (NYSE:BAC) I had a very complex piece of litigation in Texas, and I hired him to handle it. I could have hired any lawyer in America -- and a lot of my colleagues from the southern district were wonder why I didn't hire them.\nI didn't know Eric Holder in a social frame. I still do not know him in a social frame. I hired him for that case because his legal skills, his integrity, and his willingness to tell me independently whether or not the case was one that should be tried or settled in a very complicated scheme was someone who I trusted.\nHe litigated the case. He did a superb job. The judge ended up sanctioning the plaintiff's lawyers which, as you know, rarely happens in federal court. And by everybody's estimate, both by lawyers in the bank and co-counsel and the judge, he did an absolutely outstanding job.\nLet me just finish by, you know, echoing what John Warner said. And I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, I mean, it was such a pleasure to see him and hear him yesterday. He nominated our oldest son to the Naval Academy. He was my senator for eight years. And just the template of what we want for public service and government.\nAnd remember what he said. He said, you know, the theme and the phrase I keep hearing with respect to this man is he's a good man. And being a good man in the attorney generalship of the United States is critical. And beyond good, as I said, I think he has superb lawyering skills. I mean, where do with find for our attorney general someone who's had the trial and prosecutorial experience of someone like Eric Holder?\nHe's a man of integrity. He's a man of the law. And I think and I know he will exercise political independence. This committee will make sure that he does that. The media will make sure that he does that. The people in the FBI will make sure that he does that. And if he doesn't, you're going to hear about it.\nI don't think you will because I don't think he will be anything except independent. But you have a great candidate here, and I really urge you to approve him for confirmation. Thank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much, Judge Freeh.\nThe next witness, Chuck Canterbury is a national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, one nation's largest and most prominent voices for law enforcement officers. He served in numerous capacities in that organization -- national vice president, national second vice president, of course, now, he's president.\nTwenty-five years of experience in law enforcement, police officer in South Carolina -- it was in Horry County, wasn't it? He's also been appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the Medal of Valor board. He serves on our nation's Homeland Security Council. He's certainly no stranger to this committee.\nAnd, Mr. Canterbury, please go ahead, sir.\nCANTERBURY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member Specter. We're very pleased to be here and graciously accepted the invitation. As the spokesperson of the largest law enforcement organization not only in the country but, obviously, in the state of Pennsylvania and, hopefully, one day in the state of Vermont, Senator, we're very pleased to be here to offer our strong up the for this candidate to be the next attorney general of the United States.\nAlso, very fortunate to have both of you gentlemen and the leadership that you provide for the law enforcement community across this country is greatly appreciated by my peers in law enforcement.\nUpon hearing the news that President-elect Obama intended to tap Mr. Holder for this Cabinet position, we directed our legislative staff to probably conduct the most exhaustive examination of a candidate's record for anybody that we've ever endorsed for a position of attorney general.\nWe looked at his record of his 12 years at the Department of Justice in the Public Integrity Section, his role as the deputy attorney general, and that of the time he spent in the judicial branch as a judge. It was an extremely thorough review. His positions, his policy work, and the official acts were consistent with the goals of the FOP. And we have every reason to believe that he will be an exemplary U.S. attorney general with whom we will have a very productive relationship.\nI think the FOP brings a unique perspective to this nomination because of our familiarity with his record in the courtroom and as a judge and as a U.S. attorney. As part of this review process, we talked to the rank-and-file officers in the District of Columbia, one of our largest groups, and talked to them about his time in superior court as a judge.\nCANTERBURY: To a man, every individual that we talked to reported that he was fair and tough and they spoke favorably about U.S. Attorney Holder describing him as able and aggressive as a prosecutor. And from the perspective of the line officers who work on real cases, those are the adjectives that you want to hear as a police officer.\nThe FOP has a better sense and a complete picture because of the interviews that we conducted with our membership with the men on the street that actually worked cases with Eric Holder.\nI'd also like to add that we talked to a lot of our career employees, members of our organization who worked at the Department of Justice -- the best of the best. And many of them are members of our organization and they were anxious for us to endorse Eric Holder for this position. It's one that they felt was one of their own who could take the helm of the department and restore of integrity that we felt the department needed.\nThe FOP with also privileged to have the opportunity to discuss with Mr. Holder a number of different issues including his vision for the Department of Justice and the ability to have input and talk to him about the crime-fighting strategies and the policies that affect our members, the rank and file, the boots on the street.\nI believe that the president-elect has made a great choice in Eric Holder to be the next attorney general of the United States. We want to emphasize that all the major law enforcement organizations have announced their support. I believe it's unprecedented that you have the chiefs, the rank and file, the sheriffs, all organizations standing together on this.\nI urge the committee to complete their review of this nominee in as quickly as fashion as possible and favorably report this to the Senate floor. As you examine his record, I believe you'll find him not only well qualified but excess possessing the requisite character, knowledge, and skills to do this job and be an extremely effective leader for the department.\nAnd, again, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, we thank you for the invitation and we urge you to move this along as quickly as possible. We believe that he will be a fine attorney general.\nThank you, sir.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Canterbury. And I thank you for -- your organization for all the time that you have spent up here for this committee, the (inaudible), Mr. (Inaudible) who's here often on critical law enforcement matters that we have before us. And I appreciate that.\nOur next witness is John Payton. He became director counsel and president of the NAACP legal defense fund last March. This is after a very good long and distinguished career in private practice.\nHe's the sixth person to lead the legal defense fund in its 67- year history. It was started by Thurgood Marshal. Mr. Payton is recognized as one of the premiere litigators in this country. His civil rights experience includes Supreme Court arguments defending the use of race-based remedies in the University of Michigan's admission criteria. He worked in private practice here in Washington, D.C. for the law firm of Wilmer Hale.\nHe was corporation counsel of the District of Columbia. He served as president of the District of Columbia Bar. He's taught at Harvard, Georgetown, and Howard Law Schools.\nAgain, he's no stranger to this committee. And Mr. Payton, thank you very much, sir, for being here.\nPAYTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nIt is a pleasure to be here, especially, on the occasion of the nomination of Eric Holder. I'm here to support enthusiastically his nomination to be attorney general of the United States. The legal defense fund views it as a national imperative that the Department of Justice live up to its name by delivering justice and equality for all people in the United States.\nThe harsh reality today -- and it's a very harsh reality today is that the Department of Justice is in shambles. Mr. Holder, if he's confirmed, will inherit a department with its very credibility in question. The entire department has been decimated by scandal and controversy from the firings of the U.S. attorneys to the use of an ideological test for the Justice Department's honors program to the assault on the civil rights division.\nThe task at hand is nothing less than to reclaim the soul of the Department of Justice. As former Attorney General Edward Levi phrased it immediately after Watergate, a strikingly analogous set of circumstances, but I believe the core of the soul of the Department of Justice is its civil rights division.\nYes, integrity must be restored to all of the department's operations. And, yes, it must regain its independence from political influence. But the area in which the department has been most damaged is the civil rights division which has been plagued by problems that have shaken its very foundation.\nPress reports and hearings from this committee have revealed the insertion of politics into litigation decisions. The weakening of enforcement, improper or possibly illegal personnel practices, and a substantial decline in cases filed to protect racial and ethnic minorities. Politics and ideology have triumphed over even-handed enforcement at almost every turn.\nCareer civil rights lawyers in the department have been demoralized and many have been literally driven out of the department. This Tuesday, the department's office of inspector general and the office of professional responsibility released their joint report on an investigation of allegations of politicized hiring and other improper personnel actions in the civil rights division.\nThe report was completed last July but only released this week. It is a shocking report. It shows, as the earlier report identified, an enemies list that was used to actually keep people from becoming members of the department. The entire Department of Justice honors program used the enemies list. Our organization, the legal defense fund, was on the list.\nThe second report is even more shocking than the first. It concludes that hiring in the special litigation section, the employment litigation section, the voting section, the criminal section, the appellate section, all were illegally infected with political and ideological considerations. And it makes a criminal referral to the U.S. attorney's office.\nBut as I said, the entire Department of Justice has suffered grievously. The challenge for the next attorney general requires very special leadership and very special commitment. It requires someone who can inspire and be an example.\nYesterday's hearing, I believe -- and I sat through almost all of it and heard the rest -- was a dramatic example and dramatic evidence of why President-elect Barack Obama has selected Eric Holder to lead the Department of Justice at this critical moment.\nWe face perilous times both internationally and domestically. The legal issues before us are complex and dynamic. I think there is no better person than Eric Holder to restore integrity and honor to the entire Department of Justice and the ethical standing and reputation for excellence of its civil rights division.\nHe has an exceptional resume which you heard about yesterday. Columbia, Columbia Law School, the honors program, lawyer in the public integrity section, a judge, U.S. attorney, deputy attorney general, partner at a very prestigious law firm.\nLet me just add one other things to his resume. He began his legal career as a legal intern at legal defense fund. And ironically, in the recently past, that would have disqualified him from working at the Department of Justice.\nI also know Eric from my own history and professional experience in this town. As you said, Mr. Chairman, I was a partner at a law firm for many years here. I was corporation counsel. I was president of the D.C. Bar. I've known Eric for almost that entire time. We are friends.\nI think that his personal commitment to issues of justice and equality is exceptional. His experience and the strength of his commitment to fairness assure me -- and I'm sure they assure this committee -- that the odious practices identified in this week's report by the inspector general will never be tolerated on his watch.\nLet me reiterate one final point. I don't think there is a better person to lead the Department of Justice at this critical moment than Eric Holder. And with his nomination, we can begin to restore the crown jewel of our nation's legal system.\nI urge the Senate to confirm Eric Holder as the next attorney general of the United States. He'll make us all proud.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Payton.\nAnd I do appreciate that. I'm actually -- with your testifying -- reminded me of something I was going to do yesterday. And because we went so late, I didn't. But we've -- Judge Freeh has talked about all the different people who have written in in support of Eric Holder. Mr. Canterbury talked about the unique nature of all the different types of law enforcement being for him.\nAnd I put letters from those different organizations in the record yesterday. But we've also received letter of support for Mr. Holder's nomination assigned by more than 60 civil rights organizations. According to the NAACP, the Leadership Conference in Civil Rights, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Women's Law Center, the American-Arab Anti-discrimination Committee, the Anti-defamation League, the AFL-CIO, the Asian-American Justice Center, and a whole lot more.\nSo I will put the whole entire list of support into the record along with a -- along with the letters.\nSo thank you very much.\nMs. Townsend, it's always good to see you.\nAnd she was, until last year, homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to President George W. Bush, where she chaired the Homeland Security Council. Certainly one person that most people in the country, when you would be interviewed on television or others, would listen very carefully to on a subject that effects every one of us. She advised the president on homeland security policy, anti-terrorism matters. Certainly, have been in meetings with the president and has gone out of his way to praise the advice you've given him.\nPreviously, Ms. Townsend spent 13 years at the Department of Justice in a variety of senior positions including counsel to attorney general for intelligence policy -- which I believe was probably the first place we met -- acting deputy assistant attorney general, director of the office of international affairs, chief of staff to the assistant attorney general in the criminal division.\nShe worked with Mr. Holder during his tenure as a U.S. attorney and as deputy attorney general. He served as a federal prosecutor in the United States Attorney's office in the southern district of New York. She began her prosecutorial career as an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, New York. That was probably after Eugene Gold.\nThe reason I mention him, he and I served on the board of the National District Attorneys Association. We, oftentimes, had meetings in his office.\nSo thank you for appearing. And please go ahead -- please go ahead and do your testimony.\nTOWNSEND: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the warm welcome I've received. It really is a privilege and an opportunity to be here today before the committee to testify in support of the nomination of Eric Holder to be attorney general.\nYou went through my resume, if you will, and I suppose to many here my appearance in support of Eric comes as something of a surprise given my most recent position. But as you noted, my 23 years of public service included 13 years at the Department of Justice where I worked both with Eric Holder and for Eric Holder at various points.\nEric's career, both as a superior court judge and as a career prosecutor in the public integrity section in the criminal division rightly earned him both the respect and the affection of career prosecutors not only here in Washington but around the country in the U.S. attorney's offices around the nation.\nNot surprisingly, given his experience, I found Mr. Holder to be open-minded, fair, and respectful of the views and the opinions of career lawyers. Mr. Holder was never reluctant to hear discussions between career and appointed staff if there was a disagreement among them and, oftentimes, that was the case.\nHe decided those issues in accordance with the facts and his best judgment, giving serious consideration and respect to the advice of the career lawyers. In his interactions with the office of intelligence and policy review, he took his national security responsibilities seriously and he always made himself available whenever he was needed.\nHe carefully reviewed the detailed documents prepared for submission to the foreign intelligence surveillance accord when his approval was required and unfailingly deliberated on the questions and facts before signing such submissions.\nIn yesterday's testimony, Mr. Holder spoke about being at the department during the East Africa Embassy bombings and in 2000 during the Cole. One of the cases I thought I might mention to you because I think it's very relevant to the execution of his national security responsibilities was the successful prevention of the millennium attack of 1999 into 2000.\nAs the committee is aware, and as Director Freeh will recall, this was a very difficult time. We had very specific threat information. Both Attorney General Janet Reno and the deputy attorney general were personally involved in the Justice Department and FBI's investigations.\nTOWNSEND: We took risks to prevent that attack. We made considered legal judgments to prevent that attack. We applied the foreign intelligence surveillance act in a far more aggressive way that had ramifications beyond the disruption of the millennium attack. That case could have, if tradition had held, been prosecuted under criminal wiretap laws. I believed at the time, and recommended both to the director and the attorney general, that we use the foreign intelligence surveillance act legally and appropriately in that investigation.\nEric Holder was a part of that deliberation. They were persuaded that the use of the foreign intelligence surveillance act to disrupt that plot was correct. That plot was not only successfully disrupted. Individuals who were later criminally prosecuted, the prosecutors in the southern district of New York legally and appropriately used the tapes from the foreign intelligence surveillance and that was upheld on appeal.\nThat's the kind of man Eric Holder is. That was a difficult legal decision. It was a close call. And it was a decision that he was willing to take because he understood the seriousness of the threat.\nBut I wish to be clear. I am not here because I believe that, if confirmed as attorney general, Eric Holder will decide legal issues necessarily in the same way that I would. On the contrary, I expect that there would often be times where this is not the case. I am here because I believe Eric is competent, capable, and a fair-minded lawyer who will not hesitate to uphold and defend the laws and the Constitution of the United States.\nI know Eric to be an honest, decent man of the highest ethical standards who both understands and appreciates the strong and proud traditions of the Department of Justice and will protect and honor them.\nThe attorney general position must be filled quickly. We remain a nation at war and a nation that faces the continuous threat of terrorist attack. We cannot afford for the attorney general position to sit vacant or for there to be a needlessly protracted period where the leadership of the department is in question.\nFor these reasons, sir, I humbly and respectfully recommend that the committee move expeditiously to confirm Eric Holder as attorney general of the United States.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: Ms. Townsend, thank you very much. I appreciate that. And I -- especially, as you stated, the areas where you disagree with Mr. Holder.\nI think in my 34 years here, there has never been an attorney general from a Republican or Democratic administration, including attorneys general I voted for, that I haven't found something where I've disagreed.\nJoseph Conner is the son of Frank Conner. Frank Conner was still a young man when he lost his life in a bombing at Fraunces Tavern in New York. The bombing was conducted by Puerto Rican nationalist group called the Armed Forces for National Liberation -- FALN.\nMr. Conner testified before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1999 about the clemencies granted to some FALN members. He worked with Senator Hatch to introduce the Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act to Congress in 2000.\nI was (inaudible) very much at reading your testimony, Mr. Conner, all of which will be placed in the record, of course. When you spoke about the fact that your father would never get to see his grandchildren.\nMy colleagues on this committee have to hear my stories ad infinitum about my grandchildren because it's one of the greatest joys of life to have your grandchildren. So we thank you for coming back to the Senate. You've been here before. And please go ahead, sir.\nCONNER: Well, thank you. Thanks for having me back. They say you love your children but you really love your grandchildren. So...\nLEAHY: Without taking up your time, I'd add that I've told people that I've discovered this hidden clause in the Constitution which requires grandparents to spoil their grandchildren then turn them back to the parent (OOTC:KIDSQ) to have to deal with the consequences.\nCONNER: Oh, so that's what happens, I guess. OK. Thank you. Thanks for the insight.\nMy name is Joseph Conner and I'm here, as the senator said, for a second time once again addressing the unimaginable, immoral, really dangerous 1999 clemencies to 16 Puerto Rican terrorists of Los Macheteros and the FALN. We'll call them the FALN.\nThese terrorist proudly claimed responsibility for over 130 bombings in the U.S., including the murder of my 33-year-old father, Frank Conner, as he ate lunch at Fraunces Tavern in downtown New York. It was January 24, 1975. Despite the warnings and recommendations to the contrary from the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, prosecutors, Janet Reno herself, then deputy attorney general or current attorney general nominee, Eric Holder yesterday flatly admitted recommending release of those terrorists.\nUpon hearing those words yesterday, some questions popped into my mind. One was: Did he actually believe in their cause? Number two, did he recommend the release at someone else's direction, perhaps, the president? Or number three and maybe most disturbing, did he not know what they did?\nIt seemed that a lot of the issues that were raised, he claimed he didn't know about from the surveillance tape of them building bombs to the -- to their threat of judgment (inaudible) at their sentencing. And that was disturbing.\nHe admitted to have taken advice from people outside our government, dignitaries, if you will, folks like Desmond Tutu, Jimmy Carter, Coretta Scott King and ignored those people within our government -- the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, the prosecutors. Something didn't add up.\nWhen we look back at the people whose recommendation he did take, on what information were they basing their recommendation? Where they told the political prisoner -- I put that in quotes -- line that the pro-FALN people were passing? Or did they actually know the facts? Something tell us me if they knew the facts, they wouldn't be recommending this.\nPutting aside his well-documented involvement in the outrageous pardon of Mark Rich, the attorney general nominee's egregious recommendation for playing Russian roulette by unleashing unrepentant terrorists on the American people against the advice of the FBI, Bureau of Prisons, prosecutors, even Janet Reno herself should disqualify him on its own merit.\nIt's almost ten years ago but, incredibly, we're revisiting today the same issues. The recriminations of the hearings and how sad that we have to go through this again. We knew the clemencies were wrong in 1999. After all, the Senate voted 95 to 2 to condemn them. Yet here we are contemplating the confirmation of the architect of that very release as a top law enforcement officer in our country. How can this be?\nIf anything, the devastating attacks of 9/11, we should be more resolute in our opposition to anybody who would be soft on terror or support any terrorist organizations.\nIf anyone needs to be reminded about what terrorism can do, give me a couple of minutes. It was a beautiful January on January 24, 1975. I had just turned nine. My brother Tom had just turned 11. That night, my mom was cooking us a dinner to celebrate our birthdays, and we were expecting our father home on time to celebrate with us.\nWell, after we got home from school, we found out that there was a bombing downtown. We didn't know my father was in it right away. My mom didn't know he had a meeting that day. He wore an old suit when he wasn't expected to be with clients. But when she called up, he didn't answer. She knew then something was wrong.\nAfter hours, we finally got the news that he'd be killed. He and three others were murdered that day intentionally and, as we may find out later from Rick who will give a bit more information, the bomb was meant to kill a lot more people than the four that it ended up killing.\nMy dad was only 33, as a mentioned. He was the only child of immigrants Thomas Conner and Margaret Maloney. His father was an elevator operator downtown and his mom was a cleaning lady at J.P. Morgan. She was so proud when she got him the job so he wouldn't be in a dangerous position. His friends were becoming cops and firemen or working in the subways. But he got a job in a nice office at a high school.\nAnd his was an American success story. He went to college at night. He worked his way up to an officer position at J.P. Morgan. And he had two sons and he had made something of himself.\nFrom a cleaning lady to an officer at the bank. It was an amazing story. Although my mom is remarried to a fine man and my brother Tom and I have families of our own, not a day passes without us feeling devoid that this was left in our lives. My father's death has become a wound. And it was reopened when the clemencies were offered, and it's been reopened now by this nomination.\nThese terrorists took away my dad's life. As we mentioned, he never got to see his sons graduate high school, college, meet his daughters-in-law, or be a grandfather.\nYou know, we ask why. My kids ask why. What happened. It seems that it was all done for politics. Was a direction from the president to further his wife's Senate future. Or was it something else? Was it a -- someone who believed in the cause of the terrorists?\nWho were the FALN? Like I said, Rick will get into it a little bit more. But contrary to the disingenuous claims we heard yesterday, there was nothing non-violent about these people. These people blew up 130 bombs in the U.S. They killed five people. And they meant to kill a lot more.\nThey have devastated lives and maimed. The day after their release, one of them was on with Tim Russert. And when asked about the Fraunces bombing, one of the released, one of these people who was non-violent, had nothing to do with it said well, you know what, the restaurant didn't take the proper precautions.\nBlaming someone else, never taking responsibility for what happened. And these people were released. On 9/11, my brother Tom and I commuted through the World Trade Center. We left -- I said goodbye to him in the World Trade Center and I went my way, he went his. At quarter to nine, a saw the tower -- the north tower explode out my window. I couldn't get Tom on the phone and I called my cousin Steve who worked at Counter Fitzgerald. Steve never answered. Steve was my father's godson. He was killed on 9/11.\nTom and I got home that night safely to our families. But there's consequences. Terrorism cannot be treated as a political tool. It has to be treated for what it does. It kills people and it hit our family very hard twice.\nDespite what Mr. Freeh just said, the clemency process was not followed properly. We were never informed as a family of their release. Although, I understand we were supposed to have been through the Victim's Rights and Restitutions Act of 1990. The terrorists did not request clemency. They did not express remorse. They were not acquired to provide information solving other crimes. They were allowed 30 days to decide to accept the conditions. And they were given conference calls between prisons.\nNow, clemency is an individual grant, yet they were treated as a group. And that's not right.\nSupporters were given nine meetings with Mr. Holder and his group. You know how many we got? None. He never talked to us. Despite what he said yesterday, he didn't -- there was no consideration to the victims, at least, to the people I know.\nHad we been properly notified, we would have told him what happened because it seems like yesterday from the conversation he didn't know about the threats to the judge. He didn't know about them building bombs. It was a very disturbing moment in the interviews yesterday.\nThe biggest issue that I read in the recently-released memos as they came from the Justice Department was how the public relations fallout might be if these guys committed more crimes. Not what might happen to those people who were injured by them, but what the public relations issues would be for Holder and his team if something went wrong.\nI have a whole litany of questions I would like to put into the record. I know I'm kind of going late now. I can read them now or I can do it at another time. But I have a bunch...\nLEAHY: I've read them. And if you want to (inaudible), go ahead.\nCONNER: OK.\nLEAHY: I'm trying to give as much flexibility to all the witnesses...\nCONNER: I appreciate that. Look, I know I'm going long.\nLEAHY: OK. I know this is a difficult time. I'm not trying to cut you off. And your whole statement, of course, will be made part of the record. But if there's some of those questions you'd like to emphasize, please go ahead.\nCONNER: Thank you. Yesterday, a lot of issues came up that caused this -- my statement to change and my questions to change because he said some things that were just a surprise.\nHe admitted that he know so little about the terrorists. As he testified yesterday, he hadn't seen the surveillance video, didn't know they threatened the judge. How then could he know enough about the case to feel comfortable in releasing them? What does that say about the judgment there?\nCONNER: He said none of these terrorists were part of any attacks that killed or hurt people. Given his limited knowledge on the subject, how could he possibly know that? And given what Ricardo Jimenez said on \"Meet the Press,\" that's just not true. He took -- he took advice of others over his own due diligence from what I could see, and that's irresponsible. It borders on incompetence.\nNow, I know he has a long record, and I know there's a lot of good people here who have spoken to his -- his -- you know his successes in the past, but it's not unprecedented that one mistake can -- can disqualify you.\nLook what happened when -- when Clinton had Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood. They were both very qualified people, and both of them had to withdraw their nomination, because they did something like hire illegal aliens to work in their house and didn't pay taxes on them, which to me is far less egregious than what he did.\nWe talked about -- you mentioned yesterday that Cardinal O'Connor supported clemency. That's not true. I have a letter from the cardinal specifically saying he didn't, because I contacted the cardinal at the time.\nWe -- we came here in 2000 and introduced the Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act, and we warned at the time about future terrorist that, and we hoped that that by instituting this act, which never was instituted, that there wouldn't be releases like this, that there would be a light shining on people so they would -- everyone would know what the pardon attorney was doing and what the Justice Department was doing before the clemencies were released.\nAnd that's a transparency that we need, not -- not yesterday in the meetings when Mr. Holder was asked to produce a document recommending that you clemency. He didn't want to do it.\nNow, this new administration is supposed to be the most transparent in our government history, yet his attorney general has no transparency.\nI'll go now, but I urge the Senate to review Mr. Holder's record, put aside any politics, put themselves in the shoes of ordinary Americans, who had given them their trust in their vote, and decide if this man, who recommended playing Russian roulette with the American people by releasing unrepentant terrorists, should be charged with protecting our fellow citizens.\nI think ordinary Americans would agree the answer is very clear. Thank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Conner.\nMr. Hahn, Richard Hahn, is the president and CEO of R. Hahn & Company Inc., a security consulting and investigating company specializing in counterterrorism and homeland defense. He retired from the FBI after a distinguished career that spanned 33 years -- is that correct, Mr. Hahn? -- as a senior supervisory agent and as a special agent.\nAs a member of the FBI, investigated domestic and international terrorist organizations, specializing in events carried out by the armed forces and the national liberation of the FALN.\nAnd he testified before this committee in 1999 -- 10 years ago -- about the FALNL and clemencies.\nThank you for coming back and testifying again. Of course, your whole statement will be made part of the record. Please go ahead, Mr. Hahn.\nHAHN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n(OFF-MIKE) My purpose in being here today is to make clear just who and what the FALN Macheteros were.\nThese organizations were no less terrorists than any of the terrorist organizations recognized by this government today. These were clandestine organizations with cellular structure and secret membership.\nThis makes knowing who did what acts inside the conspiracies difficult, not impossible. But despite this, through investigation some acts attributable to those who received clemency are known.\nFormer FALN member Freddie Mendez chose to cooperate with the government after being convicted on federal charges, but before being sentenced. Mendez described being mentored by FALN leader Oscar Lopez, one of those offered clemency.\nLopez taught Mendez how to detect and avoid surveillance, used dead drops for communications, the code words used by the FALN, how to operate safe houses, and how to build a bomb.\nMendez participated in the preparation of bombs in October of 1979 and which were coordinated with the Macheteros. On that occasion he was assisted by Oscar Lopez and Ida Luz Rodriguez and carried a bomb with Ricardo Jimenez to the Democratic Party headquarters in Chicago with the intention of placing it in their offices.\nThree bombs were placed in Chicago that day.\nHe participated with Oscar Lopez, Dylcia Pagan, Ida Luz Rodriguez, Haydee Torres, Luis Rosa, Ricardo Jimenez and William Morales in the armed assault on a National Guard Armory in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, to steal weapons and explosives. Employees were put on the floor, guns placed at their heads, and they were repeatedly threatened during the takeover.\nHe also participated in the armed takeover of Carter-Mondale campaign headquarters in Chicago for the purpose of intimidating campaign workers and delegates to the convention.\nMendez named participants in the planning and execution of this invasion as himself, Oscar Lopez, Carmen Valentine, Dylcia Pagan, Ricardo Jimenez, Ida Luz Rodriguez, Luis Rosado and Alicia Rodriguez.\nIt is noted that they carried rifles and a variety of pistols into the assault, and again workers were threatened, bound, gagged, and the offices ransacked.\nMendez was arrested in Evanston, Illinois, along with Carlos Torres, Haydee Torres, Adolfo Matos, Ricardo Jimenez, Dylcia Pagan, Ida Luz Rodriguez, Alicia Rodriguez, Luis Rosa, Elizam Escobar and Carmen Valentine.\nSome of these conspirators had just participated in the armed takeover of a truck rental agency, not only stealing a truck, but robbing the patrons of personal effects.\nThe group had gathered in Evanston for the express purpose of robbing an armored car that serviced Northwestern University. All were wearing disguises and armed.\nIn a separate investigation of an FALN safe house apartment operated by Alejandrina Torres and Edwin Cortes, over 21 pounds of dynamite, 24 blasting caps, four handguns, over 3,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered and seized. Also found were disguised materials, false identification and terrorist training manuals.\nCortes and Torres were videotaped as they built firing circuits for bombs. They also were surveilled electronically and physically as they made plans and traveled to Wadsworth Veterans Hospital in Kansas with weapons and explosives to attempt to the escape of FALN leader Oscar Lopez.\nA second safe house apartment in Chicago searched in April 1983 was found to contain a semiautomatic rifle, silencers, bulletproof vests and documents, including intelligence materials, from the police of Puerto Rico.\nCortes and co-conspirator Alberto Rodriguez were surveilled electronically as they plotted an armed robbery, and subsequently with Alejandrina Torres, as they planned bombing of military installations in Chicago.\nRegarding other crimes of the FALN, as you know, they engaged in a campaign of bombings that started in 1974 and did not end until 1983. This campaign encompassed over 100 explosive and incendiary attacks, killed five and maimed scores of others, including several police officers. Some of these attacks were designed to kill. In December 1974 the FALN called in a report of a dead body in a building in Spanish Harlem. A booby trap explosive device hung up on the opposite side of the main entry door.\nExploding as the door opened, a New York P.D. officer was blinded in one eye and severely maimed. Ironically, the officer, Angel Poggi, was Puerto Rican himself, and even more incredible, it was his first day on the job.\nIn January 1975 the bombing of Fraunces Tavern killed four and wounded 60. Credit was claimed within minutes by written FALN communique. In August 1977 the FALN conducted the daytime bombing of the employment offices of Mobil Oil in Manhattan, killing one and maiming several others.\nThe Macheteros have a similar history of terrorist acts. In 1978 the Macheteros ambushed a patrol car of the police of Puerto Rico in an attempt to steal weapons, uniforms and the patrol car itself. One of the officers was killed as he resisted the ambush. The other, stripped of his uniform, was left handcuffed to a tree at the side of the road. The Macheteros proudly claimed credit for this act in a written communique.\nIn October 1979 the Macheteros in concert with the FALN conducted bombings on the island of Puerto Rico while simultaneous bombings were conducted in the U.S. Credit for these were claimed by a joint communique to the press, which bore the logos and names of both the FALN and the Macheteros.\nIn December 1979 the Macheteros with other groups conducted a well-coordinated attack on a Navy transport bus at Sabana Seca, Puerto Rico. The bus was blocked on a public highway. Then another vehicle driven by the terrorists pulled into the opposing lanes of traffic, shot the bus driver and proceeded to rake the side of the bus with automatic weapon fire. Two died, and many more were wounded.\nIn January of 1981 the Macheteros bondage jet aircraft of the Puerto Rican National Guard, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in damage to the specialized aircraft.\nIn 1983 the Macheteros fired LAW rockets at the FBI office in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, and that the U.S. courthouse in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nAnd finally, in the fall of 1983, the Macheteros engineered one of the greatest thefts in U.S. history, the theft of over $7 million in U.S. currency from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford, Connecticut. Much of the money ended up in the hands of Cuban agents.\nAll of this is a matter of public record not only accessible to the Department of Justice, but to any motivated citizen, who wishes to find these facts. All this makes clear that these conspirators were not merely activists, but in fact were indeed terrorists.\nIn my opinion granting them clemency in the absence of any cooperation or understanding of who committed the most heinous of crimes remains a compromise of our justice system and reflects a failure of the government personnel with oversight of such matters to competently carry out their duties.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much.\nOur last witness is Stephen Halbrook. He's practiced law for over 30 years. He's authored -- edited seven books and dozens of articles related to the right to bear arms.\nHe's also the author of an amicus brief in a recent Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court District of Columbia versus Heller, submitted on behalf of Vice President Cheney and 250 members of the House of Representatives.\nMr. Halbrook is known in my state, a state which actually, as I mentioned yesterday, has no gun laws except during hunting season. And then we have certain restrictions if you're going to hunt on the state house lawn. I also noted the fact that I own numerous weapons, and I -- I'm almost tempted -- well, I'll tell the story about Director Freeh and myself target shooting in my backyard in Vermont later on.\nGo ahead, Mr. Halbrook.\nHALBROOK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Senator Leahy and Senator Specter. It's a real pleasure to be here.\nI did file the amicus brief on behalf of not only of 250 representatives, but also 55 senators, including majority members of this committee, in the Heller case.\nHeller, as you know, held that the Second Amendment means what it says. The right of the people to keep and bear arms means that individual have that -- have that right.\nI'm author of the book, \"The Founders' Second Amendment,\" and numerous other publications. I've done a lot of litigation on this subject in the Supreme Court. I'm outside counsel for the NRA. I'm not representing them here today.\nAnd this is an issue that we have an explicit constitutional guarantee. We live in an age when people invent rights, and they seem to be implicit in the Constitution. And I like Senator Leahy's \"the right to spoil grandchildren is an implicit constitutional right\" -- it's a lot more innocuous than other ones that -- that might be invented -- and fully support that concept.\nAs you know, Mr. Holder filed -- or rather joined in an amicus brief in the Heller case, denying that the Second Amendment protects an individual right and seeking to uphold the total ban on handguns by D.C. residents.\nMy -- my background, by the way -- I've appeared before this committee a number of times, going back to the 1982 committee -- subcommittee on the Constitution hearing and report which is entitled, \"The Right to Keep and Bear Arms.\"\nSerious concerns I think are raised about Mr. Heller's -- Mr. Holder's position. Throughout his career he's denied that the Second Amendment basically means anything in regard to private citizens, and he's advocated basically the criminalization of what many people consider to be their constitutional rights.\nAnd I'm talking about, for example, the advocacy of making it a five-year felony to possess an unregistered firearm in the District of Columbia. That was when he was U.S. attorney. And there's been many other draconian proposals that he's -- he's set forth.\nI listened carefully yesterday to Mr. Holder's testimony -- in particular, the question that, \"If the Supreme Court reconsidered the issue of the meaning of the Second Amendment, whether it was recognized individual rights does refer to the right of the people after all or some kind of elusive collective right that doesn't protect anybody, and if the Supreme Court revisits that -- that issue, what position would you take?\"\nHALBROOK: And Mr. Holder responded that, \"First, it would depend on the facts even though facts really don't matter in the interpretation of a constitutional provision.\"\nAnd he did say that steri decisis is one consideration that would be taken into account. I think the -- given that he has supported the so-called collective rights view for his career, it's most likely that he would, indeed, support a reconsideration of the meaning of the Second Amendment.\nAnd, in addition to that, Mr. Holder, based on his career-long proposals for draconian firearm bans, would be likely to say that nothing really violates the Heller Decision if it, indeed, stands the test of time.\nI'm not going to get into any policy questions, but I did take note yesterday that he advocated the reenactment of the so-called assault weapon ban as a permanent fixture. The Heller Decision did talk about firearms that are commonly possessed by law-abiding people for lawful purposes as being protected by the Second Amendment. It might depend on what a person arbitrarily chooses to call by this pejorative term \"assault weapons\" whether that test would be met or not. But there's a lot of meat in the Heller Decision that basically says that banning commonly possessed firearms would violate the Second Amendment.\nHe mentioned that the -- what he called the gun show loophole must be closed. And if reminds me of his prior advocacy of a federal law that would require background checks on all private intrastate transactions involving firearms, presumably making it a felony to give a firearm to your grandchild as a gift without a federal background check.\nAnd, also, he has advocated the registration of all firearms that all of those background checks on private transfers would be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives. So we would have a registration system of firearms.\nHe was asked yesterday about proposals to ban firearm possession by individuals who are in the age group 18 to 21 years old. And that was a proposal that he supported. Mr. Holder supported a Chart 1768 back in 1999. So you would have the phenomenon of a person who's serving in the armed forces, eligible to do so at age 18, eligible to vote, serve on juries, and it would be a federal felony for them to possess a firearm. Now the attorney general not only prosecutes federal crimes and influenced courts on the meaning of constitutional rights. The attorney general also administers and enforces the Gun Control Act through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\nFor his entire career, Mr. Holder has denied that individuals have any Second Amendment rights. On behalf of law-abiding citizens, he has advocated that firearms must be registered, and the possession of an unregistered firearm be punished with five years imprisonment.\nThe millions of Americans who exercise their Second Amendment rights rightly feel uneasy about this nomination.\nMuch has been said about unjust prison sentences imposed on persons who possess crack cocaine, not to mention the rights of alleged terrorists held at Gitmo and other places. And we would hope for sympathy to be shown for Americans who bother no one and who merely wish to exercise their Second Amendment rights without being sent to prison because they possess a gun without the government's permission.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you. It's interesting hearing what you're saying and listening to Mr. Holder yesterday. I have a home -- or a house in Virginia I use when I'm down here. My home is in Vermont.\nI've often been struck that in your state of Virginia, your gun laws are considerably for restrictive than the laws are in my state of Vermont. For example, you couldn't just -- you couldn't carry a concealed weapon without a permit in Virginia. You could in Vermont. I mean, you could this afternoon if you were there.\nI own at least a dozen weapons of different sorts ranging -- well, of all calibers and enjoy shooting in my backyard. Can't do that in Virginia. Mr. Holder -- I asked him would he support federal laws that would restrict Vermont's laws other than the obvious ones about felons who are restricted. And that's been upheld by the court in their purchase and use of weapons.\nI asked him if he would support restricting Vermont laws. He said no. It's interesting.\nAnd we have considerably less laws than you have in Virginia on firearms.\nNow, Judge Freeh, we talked about your unique perspective. And, Mr. Halbrook, I'll let you go back to that if you care to after. But let me just -- the thought occurred while you were speaking.\nJudge Freeh, you have this unique perspective and you did work closely with Eric Holder as you described as the FBI director. You said sometimes you agreed, sometimes you disagreed.\nYou certainly been very critical of the pardon of Mark Rich and you know that both I and Senator Specter have been very critical of that pardon. Of course, it was a pardon issues not by Eric Holder. It was issued by then President Clinton.\nAnd the clemency grant of the members of the FALN, you were critical of that as was I. But the clemency was granted by President Clinton. But notwithstanding these disagreements, it he is confirmed as attorney general, he's going to be attorney general of all the country. Both you and I will be in the country served by this attorney general.\nNotwithstanding your past disagreements, you do strongly support the nomination of Eric Holder; is that correct?\nFREEH: Yes, sir. I do.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nThe question I always ask -- and I used to ask this of prosecutors in my office, and I think it's a mark of a prosecutor. I ask that they'll be politically independent, follow the rule of law, not feel they have to be subservient to any political party. I certainly prosecuted members of both Republican and Democratic Parties including a chairman of my own party.\nThe attorney general has to be independent of the president who nominates him. Do you have any question in your mind that he'd be politically independent?\nFREEH: No, I don't. The -- I mean, as you well put it, Mr. Chairman, the attorney general is not the president's lawyer. We've had, unfortunately, in that office, I think, at times, people who thought that was the case. But he is not the president's lawyer. The president has a White House counsel for those purposes.\nAnd I know that Eric Holder understands that difference. I think he would be very quickly able to say no to the president if he disagreed with him. And I think that's the confidence and trust that we need in that position.\nLEAHY: In fact, a president -- would you agree with me that a president is ill-served by an attorney general who's unwilling to say no to him if he thinks that a president is wrong?\nFREEH: Of course, he is. It not only subverts the purpose of the attorney general, but it puts the president in a very vulnerable position.\nLEAHY: And you've dealt with him when you were -- when he was deputy attorney general and you were director of the FBI. We have another FBI director now, well-respected by this committee. Do you have any doubt that if the current director were to come into an Attorney General Holder and say, Mr. Attorney General, I think you're wrong on this and here's why -- do you have any doubt that he would get a fair and complete hearing?\nFREEH: No. He would get a completely fair hearing. And I think Eric would expect that from his staff. And I think the people in the career staff who did not do that would not be his trusted advisers and would not be serving the country in their function.\nLEAHY: And, Mr. Canterbury, obviously, the Fraternal Order of Police has had some disagreements, certainly, on the clemency issue of the FALN. And I recall your organization testified to Congress. In fact, we asked you to testify to Congress at that time.\nBut do I understand your testimony correctly that you believe that Eric Holder will be a strong attorney general, especially on law enforcement matters?\nCANTERBURY: Based on the totality of his record, we absolutely believe that. We still -- we sit here like we did in '99. We abhor the clemency that was granted. We thought it was wrong just like Director Freeh. We still think it was wrong.\nBut we also believe, based on the information and the record of Eric Holder, that given the position of authority of the attorney general versus a deputy attorney general and the fact that clemency was a presidential issue and not his sole recommendation. We believe that he would be fair, and we look at it from the totality of circumstances in his career. And we feel comfortable, after an exhaustive review of his decisions as a judge and as a prosecutor.\nLEAHY: You're supporting him and you are joined by virtually every national law enforcement organization there is.\nCANTERBURY: Every organization we know of, Senator.\nLEAHY: Sorry. I went 32 seconds over my time.\nSenator Specter?\nSPECTER: This is a significantly different dimension on the hearing from other items that we have heard. And sometimes these matters on paper don't really reflect the kind of injury and the kind of scarring which isn't gone.\nBut I think it's very, very important to bear in mind what the victims have to say and how the victims feel about it. When I bumped into you yesterday in the corridor, you told me neither you or your family have come to closure. I can see it, as you described the wounds.\nAnd I think it was really unfortunate that you weren't consulted, at least, given an opportunity to be heard about it.\nDirector Freeh, welcome again to this committee -- distinguished career, FBI agent, judge, director. You have come down harder on the characterizations of what Mr. Holder has done than anybody else in the hearing. You say that the Rich pardon was a corrupt act (inaudible). You said it was a terrible mistake. He allowed himself to be used and co-opted.\nPretty tough words. Tougher than Mr. Canterbury, who characterized it as abhorrent. You said that he will be independent because the committee will make sure about that. Well, my experience, 28 years on this committee, we've been more ignored by attorneys general than been able to influence them.\nEvery time we seek information, whether assigned jointly by Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter or Chairman Arlen Specter and Ranking Member Leahy, we get nothing in return.\nYou say the media will make sure? Absolutely not. The media doesn't know what's going on. Sometimes they find out. But they can't stop it.\nIn a little bit of time, I'm not going to pursue that. I wanted to get into one question with you. With respect to the independent counsel and campaign finance, as I pressed Mr. Holder very hard about that, and I could only comment about -- about a bit of that because of the limitation of time.\nSPECTER: But there's a subject I want to take up. And this is going to be what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, so I may take a little longer, if I may.\nAnd I chaired the -- I chaired the full committee on the Rich pardon. I know a lot about that -- more than we can get into. But on the independent counsel investigation, I chaired the committee.\nAnd you made a statement, quote, \"It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an independent counsel,\" close quote. Difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointment of independent counsel.\nThat's why it seemed to me that a man of Mr. Holder's status, intelligence, experience -- that it was inexplicable. Inexplicable is the word that I apply also to the Rich pardon. Also I apply it to the FALN situation.\nThe matter is still under investigation, as you've said -- FALN -- a situation where two of the people wouldn't even accept clemency, that the federal government, the United States government had no standing to convict them. They wouldn't accept clemency -- people involved in murders and bank robberies. You could have a parade of victims that would fill a stadium.\nBut on the issue of independent counsel, Mr. Chairman, I ask consent that the memorandum from Mr. Frey to the attorney general be included in the record.\nLEAHY: Of course, without objection.\nSPECTER: That was the memorandum I'm about to refer to now.\nLEAHY: Whatever memos that you wish to be included, they will be included.\nSPECTER: Mr. Freeh, this is a matter you and I talked about when I conducted the investigation in the year 2000. I now refer to a memo, and I talked to you about it a few moments ago before the hearing started -- no surprises, no gotchas, everything on top of the table.\nThis is the memorandum, which you wrote to Mr. Esposito, one of your top deputies, about a meeting he had with Mr. Lee Radick, who was the head of the public integrity section of the Department of Justice. And this is what it says in part. Quote, \"I also advised the attorney general of Lee Radick's comment to you that there was a lot of, quote, 'pressure,' close quote, on him and PIS, Public Integrity Section, regarding this case, campaign finance investigation, because the attorney general's job might hang in the balance, parenthesis, (or words to that effect). I stated that these comments would be enough for me to take him in the Criminal Division off the case completely,\" close quote.\nThis memo is dated December 9th, 1996, and the background was that President Clinton had been reelected, and Attorney General Reno had said she wanted to stay on publicly, and she hadn't been reappointed. And then there's this meeting between your top deputy and one of her top deputies in effect saying ease off the campaign finance investigation.\nAnd you complain in this memo -- I won't read it fully because of limitation of time -- that the FBI ought to take over. The FBI had been kept out of the investigation.\nNow, that -- that is the backdrop of what is happening in the Department of Justice, where Mr. Holder is the deputy, where they're bringing the issue to the FBI to ease off so the attorney general's job will be saved.\nNow, how do you evaluate that in terms of politics -- rank politics -- reappointment of a public official interfering with investigation, law enforcement and the rule of law?\nFREEH: Well, as I said, I couldn't think of a more compelling case to go to an independent prosecutor. But let me just put that in perspective. And -- and we have spoken about this before.\nThat was not a statement, of course, by the Attorney General. It was by her public integrity section chief.\nSPECTER: Now, wait a minute, Mr. Freeh. Do you think that Radick did that all on his own?\nFREEH: Well, I don't know. I never got a chance to cross- examine.\nSPECTER: Of course, you don't know, but -- well, I'll draw the -- my inference. Radick's doing his boss' bidding. Now, that happens occasionally.\nFREEH: Well, I would draw a different inference, but I would say the following. That statement was alarming enough, together with all the other information we had, that I renewed my recommendation that this case go to an independent prosecutor.\nThe attorney general disagreed. We had a very strong, perhaps the strongest disagreement in eight years over that issue.\nEric Holder, just to put it into perspective, was, of course, aware of this -- he was the deputy -- went out of his way with me and the attorney general to say that you know Louis has a different position we have to respect that position, and actually supported the fact that I was taking a different position, which is again how I adjudge him to be willing and able to speak up and be independent.\nI didn't agree with the attorney general's determination, but she made that determination, subject to what she believed to be the right factors, and -- and we disagreed.\nSPECTER: Well, as the record will show, this memorandum you sent you sent us a copy to Mr. Holder. I will let the memo speak for itself, where Radick, one of her top deputies, talks about a lot of pressure on him and the public integrity section. I think it's an obvious conclusion that pressure is coming from the attorney general.\nFREEH: Yes, well, I don't agree with you, respectfully, Senator.\nSPECTER: OK. Why not? Why not?\nFREEH: Well, because there was never a conversation that we had where she indicated, and more importantly, any action that she ever turn up that we were aware of, and we were pretty aware of everything that was going on in the case, that it all indicated you know her aptitude or willingness or even consideration of trying to interfere with this investigation in any manner, so...\nSPECTER: Interfere?\nFREEH: Yes.\nSPECTER: Well, you weren't on the case in any real sense. This memorandum particularizes your request to her to get these people off the case. You were submitting to pressure to put the FBI in as the leading investigative agency. You weren't the lead investigative agency, where you?\nFREEH: Not at that time, no.\nSPECTER: Mr. Freeh, let me move to another very delicate subject, one which you and I discussed years ago and talked about a few minutes ago.\nYou turned down the White House request for a briefing on campaign finance reform. Would you testify to the circumstances of that matter?\nFREEH: Yes. Well, we had a criminal investigation called the campaign contributions case, and the subjects of that investigation, as you know, were senior people in the White House, including the president, the vice president and others.\nAnd they -- at some point the White House wanted to be briefed on the criminal case, which was also the intelligence operation by the Chinese Ministry of Intelligence in the United States, to which we have documentation -- this committee has looked at it -- interfering with the electoral processes here in the United States.\nSo we decided... SPECTER: Interfering with the electoral process where?\nFREEH: In the United States.\nSo we decided that we could not brief the president and senior officials, who were also the subject of the investigation on the investigation. It seemed to me a pretty no-brainer with respect to conflict, also protecting the integrity of the investigation.\nSo the attorney general and I discussed it, and we made a decision not to brief them on the criminal aspects of the case.\nSPECTER: Was there any aspect of any other governmental function -- foreign policy or anything else -- beyond the criminal investigation?\nFREEH: There was, and that part of the case was briefed to them. In other words, Chinese intelligence operations, we briefed the national security adviser.\nSPECTER: But you declined to brief the president.\nFREEH: I don't think he asked me for briefing.\nSPECTER: Well, was it -- could it have been a part of the briefing that the president did ask you for?\nFREEH: Well, no, he didn't. He didn't ask me for any briefing at all, actually. It was the national security adviser, and we briefed them on everything except the criminal aspect of the case for which subjects in the White House were now under investigation.\nSPECTER: You say the White House asked for the briefing.\nFREEH: The national security...\nSPECTER: Griffin Bell said the White House doesn't ask for things.\nFREEH: The national security adviser.\nSPECTER: OK. Well, that's -- I'm concluding now. The inferences I draw -- and I'll give you an opportunity to disagree with me -- the inferences that I draw is that this investigation was right to the top -- the president, as you testify, the vice president, attorney general's job, the question about independent counsel as to the vice president, the president being involved.\nI had told you, when we talked about it at the time -- you and I and Fred Thompson had a conversation -- that I thought you were on very shaky grounds and not responding to the president's request.\nIf you had evidence that might activate the impeachment process, you ought to go to the speaker of the house. You came to me. I'd just been chairman of Intelligence, and Fred Thompson was chairman of Campaign Finance Reform. Well, I'll let these facts speak for themselves as to what kind of pressure there was and whether Mr. Holder was a party to a matter which succumbed to political pressure.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Sessions?\nSESSIONS: Thank you.\nLEAHY: Senator Sessions was the only one that was able to claim any kind of direct connection to the nominee yesterday, because the nominee's wife is from Alabama. Her family is from Alabama.\nSESSIONS: And they are a remarkable family. She has a remarkable sister particularly, a historic figure in the civil rights movement.\nAnd let me just say, Mr. Freeh, thank you for coming. And the matter that we're discussing here, as you can tell from Senator Specter's remarks, were pretty big deals at the time, were they not? I mean this is a very intense situation, a very difficult time for you and the FBI during all these periods of allegations in campaign contributions and so forth?\nFREEH: Yes, sir, they were.\nSESSIONS: I think -- I just want to say this. I believe Senator Specter felt the pressures. He felt the development of the investigations, and Senator Specter was asking the tough questions to find the truth, as he always tries to do, and felt that there was political efforts to block that, to block the truth from being discovered, which is not consistent with the highest ideals of American justice.\nAnd it was a very difficult time. I remember it well. And so I might Mr. Holder. I think he has a lot of fine qualities. I think it's appropriate that this be inquired into. I thank you for your integrity and your testimony and in your work at the time.\nWith regard to the pardons, Mr. Freeh, your Department of Justice experience -- I think maybe the only panelist; maybe Ms. Townsend did, too, previously.\nBut there's a reason, is it not, that we have a pardon attorney. I mean there are -- thousands of people ask for pardons every year, commutations of sentences. We don't -- the president -- I think the last two or three presidents, who have served eight years, gave about 400 or 500. The vast majority are denied.\nI know the case where a former public official in Alabama in his 70s and reaching the end of his life -- maybe 80s -- was convicted 40 years ago. He's contributed to his community ever since. He'd like a pardon. I doubt he'll get a pardon. Thousands are turned down, see, more deserving than the ones that got approved. That's what upsets me, and that's what caused me to question my friend, Mr. Holder, a man I respect very vigorously, at the time that -- of the FALN pardon.\nSo everybody can make a mistake, and maybe -- somebody said the best spin you could put on this is that Bill Clinton could talk anybody into anything, so if he wanted it, maybe he just talked Mr. Holder into doing something he really didn't want to do and -- and tried to resist, but just couldn't resist. Maybe that's what happened, but it was a big mistake I think.\nSESSIONS: Mr. Hahn, yesterday I compared the fact that the people -- that some of these people didn't actually murder somebody or set off a bomb to the fact that neither did Osama bin Laden or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. They didn't actually do it; they got people who flew the airplanes and caused all the destruction.\nAnd Mr. Holder responded that this was not in the same category and that it was not his understanding that any of the terrorists, FALN terrorists, were, quote, heads of the organizations and leaders.\nDo you -- what's your evaluation of that?\nHAHN: Well, first of all, Senator, in fact, Oscar Lopez Rivera is and was a leader of the FALN. So there's no question as to whether or not...\nSESSIONS: He was an (inaudible) and his (inaudible) failed to know that when he recommended the pardon.\nHAHN: Correct. And the second point, of course, is these are clandestine organizations with secret membership. Who did what acts remains unknown. So it could very well have been, in fact, Oscar Lopez Rivera told Freddie Mendez that he had participated in bombings both in the United States and Puerto Rico.\nNow, that's president amazing since the FALN never claimed credit for any bombings in Puerto Rico, but other groups did. So did he act on behalf of other groups when he was there? We don't know the answer to those questions. So we really don't know whether or not Oscar Lopez or any of these other people may have been involved in acts in which people were killed.\nSESSIONS: Now, Mr. Freeh, that's not why you go through the pardon attorney process. You remember Kathryn Love -- I mean, Margaret Love, the former pardon attorney?\nFREEH: Yes, sir. I do.\nSESSIONS: For some reason, Mr. Holder removed her, I understand. She was, I thought, a woman of great integrity and handled the job -- she was a Democrat, but she handled the job exceedingly well. And -- but at any rate, those are the kind of facts that, if you go through the formal process, the pardon attorney gets. Does he not?\nFREEH: He does. SESSIONS: And you avoid mistakes when you do that. And you also seek out the opinions of the prosecutors who tried the case and the agents who investigated the case.\nI just feel like that was a very unwise thing. And Mr. Conner, I mean, how that went along, thank you for sharing the human perspective on this. I appreciated the little opportunity to chat with you yesterday.\nCONNER: I appreciate that, Senator.\nSESSIONS: And, you know, one of the things I think I shared with you that will troubling to me was after such a big controversy over this pardon, the Senate voted 95 to 2 -- Chairman Leahy and all the members of our committee voted to deplore President Clinton's pardon. The Mark Rich pardon was done not much longer after that.\nSo, Mr. Chairman, I'll wrap up. So I guess I'll ask Mr. Hahn or maybe -- let me ask Mr. Freeh.\nIt strikes me that after all of that flap over the FALN pardon that the deputy attorney general who was handling these matters should have been even more resistant to the Mark Rich pardon which you have considered to be corrupt and should have done everything possible to resist it. And certainly shouldn't have said I'm leaning toward it but should have said it's the position of the -- Mr. President, you can do what you want, but it's the -- my position is you should not execute this pardon.\nFREEH: Yes. No. Senator, you're absolutely right. You were -- you were a lead prosecutor. You were responsible for an office. You know, I was -- as I mentioned before, the deputy U.S. attorney in the southern district. I went over to the Swiss authorities to negotiate for Mark Rich's arrest. I mean, there was nobody more outraged at that pardon than me and my colleagues in the southern district of New York.\nBut I did say earlier this morning, you know, the White House went to extraordinary lengths to deceive the attorney general, myself, the Department of Justice, and everyone about who was on the secret pardon list, whether it's a pay-for-play list or whatever you want to call it.\nBut this -- to put, you know, Eric Holder's position in victimization in perspective, as I said, I had two FBI agents on inauguration morning eight years ago next week. I had two FBI agents standing in the cold outside of the west gate of the White House because that was the only way we were going to see the publicly-posted list of people who were pardoned.\nSo the extraordinary lengths that they went to -- and Mark Rich's lawyer being a part of that cabal, I don't think it's fair to put that blame totally on Eric Holder. He takes responsibility. And he will never make that mistake again. But I think, as Senator Warner said yesterday, he's learned from that mistake and that should certainly not be the basis upon disqualifying him for a job which I think he's going to do with excellence.\nSESSIONS: Thank you. I think you framed the issue for the Senate very well.\nAnd, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing us to have extra time.\nLEAHY: Thank you. And I'm, again, am going to put in the rest of the letters from victim's advocates and all the law enforcement in the record. I'm going to keep the record open to the close of business today. I thank all of you for being here. I know how busy you are.\nJudge Freeh, you said that you were heading to Vermont this afternoon. I want you to know that my home this morning in Vermont, the temperature is 24. That's 24 below zero.\nFREEH: Thank you, sir.\nLEAHY: Thank you. We stand recessed.", "timestamp": "2009-01-16", "title": "Senate Confirmation Hearing for Attorney General Nominee Eric Holder: Day Two"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85432", "text": "The attached letter was sent today by Lawrence H. Summers to the bipartisan leaders of the United States Senate and House of Representatives detailing President-elect Obama's commitment to implement the Emergency Economic Stabilization in a way that will promote the stability of the financial system and increase lending, preserve home ownership, promote jobs and economic recovery, safeguard taxpayer interests, and have the maximum degree of accountability and transparency possible. January 15, 2009 The Honorable Nancy PelosiThe Honorable Harry ReidSpeakerMajority LeaderUnited States House of RepresentativesUnited States SenateThe Honorable John BoehnerThe Honorable Mitch McConnellRepublican LeaderRepublican LeaderUnited States House of Representatives United States Senate\nDear Madam Speaker, Leader Boehner, Leader Reid and Leader McConnell:\nThank you for the extraordinary efforts you have made this week to work with President-Elect Obama in implementing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. In addition to the commitments I made in my letter of January 12, 2009, the President-Elect asked me to respond to a number of valuable recommendations made by members of the House and Senate as well as the Congressional Oversight Panel. We completely agree that this program must promote the stability of the financial system and increase lending, preserve home ownership, promote jobs and economic recovery, safeguard taxpayer interests, and have the maximum degree of accountability and transparency possible.\nAs part of that approach, no substantial new investments will be made under this program unless President elect Obama has reviewed the recommendation and agreed that it should proceed. If the President elect concludes that a substantial new commitment of funds is necessary to forestall a serious economic dislocation, he will certify that decision to Congress before any final action is taken.\nAs the Obama Administration carries out the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, our actions will reflect the Act's original purpose of preventing systemic consequences in the financial and housing markets. The incoming Obama Administration has no intention of using any funds to implement an industrial policy.\nThe Obama Administration will commit substantial resources of $50-100B to a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure crisis. We will implement smart, aggressive policies to reduce the number of preventable foreclosures by helping to reduce mortgage payments for economically stressed but responsible homeowners, while also reforming our bankruptcy laws and strengthening existing housing initiatives like Hope for\nHomeowners. Banks receiving support under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act will be required to implement mortgage foreclosure mitigation programs. In addition to this action, the Federal Reserve has announced a $500B program of support, which is already having a significant beneficial impact in reducing the cost of new conforming mortgages. Together these efforts will constitute a major effort to address this critical problem.\nIn addition to these commitments, I would like to summarize some of the additional reforms we will be implementing.\n1. Provide a Clear and Transparent Explanation for Investments:\n* For each investment, the Treasury will make public the amount of assistance provided, the value of the investment, the quantity and strike price of warrants received, and the schedule of required payments to the government.\n* For each investment, the Treasury will report on the terms or pricing of that investment compared to recent market transactions.\n* The above information will be posted as quickly as possible on the Treasury's website so that the American people readily can monitor the status of each investment.\n2.Measure, Monitor and Track the Impact on Lending:\n* As a condition of federal assistance, healthy banks without major capital shortfalls will increase lending above baseline levels.\n* The Treasury will require detailed and timely information from recipients of government investments on their lending patterns broken down by category. Public companies will report this information quarterly in conjunction with the release of their 10Q reports.\n* The Treasury will report quarterly on overall lending activity and on the terms and availability of credit in the economy.\n3. Impose Clear Conditions on Firms Receiving Government Support:\n* Require that executive compensation above a specified threshold amount be paid in restricted stock or similar form that cannot be liquidated or sold until the government has been repaid.\n* Prevent shareholders from being unduly rewarded at taxpayer expense. Payment of dividends by firms receiving support must be approved by their primary federal regulator. For firms receiving exceptional assistance, quarterly dividend payments will be restricted to $0.01 until the government has been repaid.\n* Preclude use of government funds to purchase healthy firms rather than to boost lending.\n* Ensure terms of investments are appropriately designed to promote early repayment and to encourage private capital to replace public investments as soon as economic conditions permit. Public assistance to the financial system will be temporary, not permanent.\n4. Focus Support on Increasing the Flow of Credit:\n* The President will certify to Congress that any substantial new initiative under this program will contribute to forestalling a significant economic dislocation.\n* Implement a sweeping foreclosure mitigation plan for responsible families including helping to reduce mortgage payment for economically stressed but responsible homeowners, reforming our bankruptcy laws, and strengthening existing housing initiatives like Hope for Homeowners.\n*  Undertake special efforts to restart lending to the small businesses responsible for over two-thirds of recent job creation.\n* Ensure the soundness of community banks throughout the country.\n* Limit assistance under the EESA to financial institutions eligible under that Act. Firms in the auto industry, which were provided assistance under the EESA, will only receive additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability.\nThe incoming Obama Administration is committed to these undertakings. With these safeguards, it should be possible to improve the effectiveness of our financial stabilization efforts. As I stressed in my letter the other day, we must act with urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system and maintain the flow of credit to families and businesses to restore economic growth. While progress will take time, we are confident that, working closely with the Congress, we can secure America's future.\nSincerely,\nLawrence H. Summers\nDirector-Designate\nNational Economic Council", "timestamp": "2009-01-15", "title": "Press Release: Letter from Lawrence H. Summers to Congressional Leaders"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85452", "text": "LEAHY: Just so that everybody understands, we are in the historic Senate Caucus Room. Normally, we would have been in a different room, but there are a number of these hearings going on. And there are certainly more people than we normally see in the hearings.\nLately, there seem to be a number of demonstrations in hearings. I just want everybody to understand the ground rules. I want everybody to be able to watch this hearing. I want them to be able to watch it comfortably. If people stand up and block the view of those behind them, I would direct the officers to remove the people who are blocking the view.\nNow, I'll take this position whether people are standing up in demonstration of a position for or against one I might hold or for or against one Senator Specter might hold or any other senator.\nI'm sure that's not going to be necessary. I'm sure everybody's going to show appropriate amount of decorum. But that's what we -- that is what we expect and that is was we'll have.\nSo with that, I welcome everybody here. The election of Barack Obama and Joe Biden and the president- elect's selection of Eric Holder, Jr. to be attorney general for the United States provides an historic opportunity for the country to move past the partisanship of the past decades.\nWe can make a real difference if we come together to solve the nation's problems and protect against serious threats and meet the challenges of our times.\nLet's honor the wishes of the American people who, in November, broke through debilitating divisions to join together in record numbers. Let us acknowledge that our inspirational new president- elect has move the forward promptly to assemble an extraordinarily well-qualified and diverse group of Cabinet officers and advisers. Let's us move away from any kind of partisanship to serve the common good.\nIt was seven score and 4 years ago that this nation answered the fundamental question President Lincoln posed in his Gettysburg Address. The world learned that liberty, equality, and democracy could serve as the foundation for this great and united nation. And we Americans have cause and occasion to reflect during the next several days about our great country.\nThe inauguration of our new president is Tuesday. Monday is a holiday the country has set aside to celebrate and rededicate ourselves to the cause of freedom and equality. Today is the anniversary of the birthday of the extraordinary man for whom that holiday is named.\nAnd with this hearing, we take another step up the path for the time Dr. King foresaw when people are judged by the content of their character.\nEric Holder has the character to serve as the attorney general of the United States of America. He passes any fair confirmation standard. His record of public serve has earned him strong support from law enforcement organizations, civil rights groups, victims rights advocates, former members of the administration of President Reagan -- the president who first nominated him as a judge -- and from those of President Bush and many others.\nThis week, the Justice Department's inspector general released a report about the shameful political interference in the civil rights division of the Justice Department during the past few years. America's diversity, when drawn together, is a source of our nation's strength and resilience. Americans have to be able to trust their Justice Department.\nThat trust can never be squandered or taken for granted. We need leaders who are prepared to take up the oars of a Justice Department whose dedicated law enforcement professionals have been misused and demoralized.\nEric Holder is just such a leader. Before the November election, I co-authored an article with my friend, the ranking member, in which we wrote the attorney general's duty is to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law not to circumvent them. The president of the American people are best served by the attorney general who gives sound advice and takes responsible action rather than one who develops legalistic loopholes to serve the partisan ends of a particular administration.\nWe wrote that article addressed to both John McCain and Barack Obama. We wrote it before we knew who was going to be president. We wrote it so the next president might adhere to our advice. And I have every confidence that Eric Holder is the person we described.\nLEAHY: The career professionals and those of us who have worked for years with the career professional at the Department of Justice, most of them we have no idea what their political background is. We just know how good they are.\nBut they reacted with delight when Eric Holder was designated by President-elect Obama because they, too, know him well. They know him from his 12 years as an anti-corruption prosecutor at the public integrity section, from his time as a U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, from his tenure as a judge, and from his service as the deputy attorney John.\nNow, I would hope that we'd have a prompt confirmation so we can restore morale and purpose throughout the Justice Department. It's important the Justice Department has its senior leadership in place without delay.\nThe attorney general is the top law enforcement officer in the country. He's a key member of the national security team. We've seen billions of dollars devoted to bailouts in the last few months. We need to ensure that those resources are not diverted by fraud or deceit. We need the Justice Department to be at its best.\nAnd I have been encouraged by the initial reaction of many Republicans, including some serving on this committee, when Mr. Holder's name was reported as a likely nominee and when he was designated by the president-elect. I commended their bipartisanship (inaudible) do one of the best friends I've ever had in the Senate, Senator John Warner who introduced Mr. Holder to the committee.\nThe responsibilities of the attorney general of the United States are too important to have this appointment delayed by partisan bickering. We've known and worked with Mr. Holder for more than 20 years. We knew him when he was nominated by President Reagan, and we confirmed him. We knew him when he was nominated by President Clinton, and we confirmed him. Three times confirmed by the Senate to important positions.\nHis record of public service, his integrity, his experience, his commitment to the rule of law merit our respect. We need an attorney general, as Robert Jackson said 68 years ago, who serves the law and not factional purposes, who approaches this task with humility. That's the kind of man Eric Holder is, the kind of prosecutor Eric Holder always was, and the kind of attorney general he will be.\nThe next attorney general will understand our moral and legal obligation to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans, to respect the human rights of all people.\nThis is part of the change we need and the change the American people voted for. When he designated Mr. Holder, President-elect Obama said let me be clear, the attorney general serves the American people and I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people, uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution.\nThe next president understands the role of the attorney general of the United States. And I have no doubt that Mr. Holder understands what's required of the attorney general. His experience, the lessons he has learned will serve him and the American people well.\nSenator Specter?\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nNext to the president of the United States, there is no federal officer more important than the attorney general. The attorney general is different from any other Cabinet officer because Cabinet officers ordinarily carry out the policies of the president. But the attorney general, has an independent duty to the people and to uphold the rule of law.\nThe Constitution calls for the United States Senate to advise and consent. And I agree with the chairman about the necessity to help President-elect Obama tackle the problems of enormous difficulties which this nation faces. There is provided, in the Constitution, separation of power and checks and balances so that it is the duty of the United States Senate to exercise its responsibilities and to make an appropriate inquiry.\nIndependence is a very important item. Harry Daugherty was attorney general during the Teapot Dome scandals. So I mention Attorney General Daugherty because, coming in, I took a look at the long list of hearings for seatings which have been held in this room. One of them was Teapot Dome. Another was the sinking of the Lusitania, the McClellan committee, Iran-Contra, many, many hearings.\nThere has been a question raised as to whether the issues when I have posed for Mr. Holder are political in nature. I have not hesitated to oppose prominent members of my own party asking pointed questions which is the constitutional responsibility of a senator and making an independent judgment and voting against them when I thought it was warranted. And one of those hearings was held right here in this room.\nAlmost every major newspaper in the country has comment about the importance of questioning Mr. Holder. And as I said on the floor, I have an open mind but I think there are important questions to be asked and upon the questions to be answered.\nThe editorials have commented about the need for the questioning of Mr. Holder based upon some of the factors in his background. There's no doubt he comes with an excellent resume, but there are questions nonetheless. So says the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Philadelphia Enquirer, the Rocky Mountain News, and many other newspapers across the country.\nThe basic issue of national security is, perhaps, the attorney general's most important responsibility to protect the American people. And I think we need to know how Mr. Holder is going to approach that job. What does he think about the Patriot Act? What does he think about the interrogation techniques?\nThere's a big difference between what is faced by those who are following the Army Field Manual compared to what the FBI does compared to what the CIA does. There are very different lines of questioning and I saw that in the 104th Congress when I chaired the Intelligence Committee.\nSPECTER: I voted against water boarding. It's torture. And I took the lead to the Senate floor in fighting for habeas corpus. And I opposed President Bush's signing statements. So I have no hesitancy to stand up on those issues.\nBut there's a very important question of balance. And we want to find out how Mr. Holder is going to approach those issues.\nWe have major issues of violent crime in this country. Career criminals have to be treated one way. I want to know what he has in mind about realistic rehabilitation, to try to take first offenders -- and especially juveniles -- out of the recidivist crime cycle.\nWe have to know where he stands on anti-trust. We need to know what he will do on the prosecution of white collar crime.\nThere have been a spate of fines, which look heavy on their surface, $1 million. But contrasted with the billions involved in the fraud, it's insufficient. I want to know how tough he's going to be along that line, especially with what we've seen with corporate fraud leading to the tremendous financial problems this country has today.\nAt the same time, there has to be a balance of right to counsel. Mr. Holder authored in 1999, the memorandum which provides that the Department of Justice will go easy on a corporation, if they will cooperate where individual constitutional privileges are involved. That's a matter which has to be inquired into, where he stands under the anti-trust laws.\nAll of these matters, I think, are appropriate for inquiry. And I look forward to an opportunity to discuss them with the nominee.\nOne additional comment. And I want to read this, because I want to get it right. I ordinarily don't read, but I will on this.\nAside from the substance of Mr. Holder's qualifications, there is a serious issue on senators' minority rights and the inadequacy of our opportunity for preparation. On this I speak for the Republican Senatorial Caucus. Ordinarily, I speak only for myself. But today, I speak for the caucus.\nIn light of Mr. Holder's extensive record -- and we looked at some 86 boxes at one stage -- there has been insufficient time for the examination of those records. On the Roberts and Alito confirmations, the minority was consulted and accorded the time they requested on scheduling. That was not done here. The chairman declined to co-sign the letter requesting records from the Clinton Library. With only my signature representing 40-plus Republican senators, my request was treated as any other citizen's request under the Freedom of Information Act, and the records have not been obtained.\nWhen the minority previously had a dozen witnesses under similar circumstances, we got three. When two witnesses, Ms. Mary Jo White and Mr. Roger Adams, refused to appear, our requests for subpoenas were denied.\nRealizing the public's understandable disdain for Washington's political bickering, we have sought to temper these objections. And I retain the cordial relationship with the chairman, with whom I've worked very closely for many years, but feel constrained to recite them here briefly for the record.\nI thank the chairman.\nLEAHY: Well, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania. I would note that, I think the last hearing for Attorney General Mukasey was -- I think we did it in four weeks. I do recall the deputy Republican leader being critical it took four weeks. And he said something about three weeks should have been enough. I believe we had a recess of some sort in between there.\nWe did it in four weeks. They said that wasn't really fast enough. This has been -- Mr. Holder was -- we were told by the Obama team in November, that he was going to be the nominee. We had November and December, and now we're into January.\nI did postpone it by an extra week from the time. I did say at the time that made it -- it went several weeks beyond what the Republican leader had said it should take for an attorney general.\nNow, this is not a lifetime position, either, as our Supreme Court justices. But be that as it may, I think adequate time has been given.\nCertainly, questions -- I understand what the distinguished ranking member has said about his opposition to waterboarding. As we know, Attorney General Mukasey would not declare that as being torture. Every Republican voted for him, nonetheless. But that's why you ask the questions, and we wanted (ph) the questions.\nOne of the first people to introduce is a distinguished colleague, John Warner. He is the former senior senator from Virginia. He served here for 30 years.\nI consider it my privilege to have served all those 30 years with him. We've traveled together around the world. We worked together. We have done so many significant pieces of bipartisan legislation together. He set the tone and tenor of what it should be.\nI have referred to him over the years as my senator when I'm away from home and spending time in the home in Virginia. I consider him a senator's senator.\nSenator Warner, please go ahead.\nWARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and distinguished ranking member, and to each of my colleagues.\nI am deeply humbled by this opportunity to appear this morning and participate in what I regard, and I think you regard, as one of the most solemn responsibilities of the United States Senate, fulfilling our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.\nI've been privileged through these 30 years in the United States Senate to know each of you and to work with each of you, and to form my own opinion that each of you will fairly and objectively and conscientiously approach this solemn duty of advice and consent for this historic nomination of Eric Holder to be the chief law enforcement officer of our nation, the attorney general of the United States of America.\nWARNER: I have known Mr. Holder for a number of years. We both started our careers basically as prosecutors, although separated by at least 20-some-odd years, two decades.\nAnd we approached our duties in life based upon the foundations that we were taught and learned in the role as prosecutors, both here in the nation's capital.\nSo, I've joined this morning out of friendship. But also, I weighed very heavily coming before the Senate again, so soon after my retirement. But I felt that I wanted to be among those all across this nation who are working for a bipartisan approach, to support the president-elect in facing what is, I think each of us believe, is the most complicated and challenging set of issues that ever faced a president.\nBehind me sits Eric Holder, and the president-elect has exercised his judgment that this is the individual whom he deems best qualified from the hundreds of thousands of lawyers serving in the United States, the best qualified to become the attorney general of the United States.\nI'm also privileged to be joined this morning by a very good friend, Eleanor Holmes Norton. We have worked together on behalf of the Greater Capitol Region these many years. And I am privileged to say that we have had some accomplishments through these years.\nQuickly, Mr. President, the public record has a complete dossier on this nominee. But given that people in every corner of the United States today are following this hearing, this very important hearing, I'd like, with the permission of the chair and ranking member, to briefly summarize how this distinguished American got from his home in the greater environment of New York City and a household which he probably classifies as middle class, to become the nominee for attorney general of the United States. It's truly remarkable.\nFortunately, the elders in his household, his parents and others, put great emphasis on education. Consequently, he excelled in public schools, and then went on, had the good fortune to get his undergraduate degree and his law degree from Columbia University.\nAnd then, rather than go into a top law firm, and perhaps a lucrative opportunity, he -- as we say in the trial profession -- he plunged into the cauldron of the courtroom to start his career, arguing case after case before the juries and the judges.\nProsecution is a tough way to enter the profession, but both of us chose this course.\nHe was a federal prosecutor in the public integrity section of the U.S. Department of Justice. There he tried many cases and prosecuted successfully widely heralded public corruption cases against officials from both -- and I emphasize \"both\" -- political parties, as recognized by the chairman and the ranking member in their opening statements.\nThereafter, Eric was appointed a D.C. superior court judge by President Ronald Reagan, recognizing this man's impartiality and his bipartisan approach to the rule of law. We always must come back that the rule of law is the fundamental foundation of this great nation of ours.\nHe performed his duties on the bench with distinction, won the accolades of both the bench and the bar, and then was appointed the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, in 1993.\nHaving been a member of that office, as I said, two decades before, I wish to point out that the United States attorney for the District of Columbia has a very wide range of jurisdiction. And much of it relates to common law crime, unlike other U.S. attorneys.\nHe performed that subject and that responsibility from 1993 to '97. From '97 to 2001, he served as deputy attorney general of the United States, the critically important number two job at the Department of Justice. And there, he gained invaluable experience for his current nomination, and developed a bipartisan reputation in making difficult and tough decisions.\nAnd on that point, I've had an opportunity in preparing for this hearing to visit with the nominee and many, many colleague who have known him and came up through the similar chairs of responsibility in the Department of Justice.\nMr. Chairman, Eric Holder would be the first to say that his career was marked by certain misjudgments. He freely acknowledges that. I doubt if there's one of us in this room, particularly those of us who have been prosecutors, who haven't looked back on our careers and recognized that we've made misjudgments.\nBut the key to this man is that he learned from those experiences, and learned in such a way that those misjudgments will not be repeated.\nFrom 2001 to the present, he practiced law as a partner in the prestigious firm here in Washington, D.C., the firm Covington and Burling, where he experienced in our criminal justice system the other side, namely, that of counsel to those who have the misfortune to fall afoul of the law.\nHe also represented major companies, executives in a wide variety of complex litigation. That's experience that he will find invaluable, if confirmed by the Senate in this new position.\nWe both readily acknowledge, Eric Holder and I, that we achieved our goals in life largely by learning from career public servants with whom we had the privilege to serve -- the clerks, the judges, the justices at all levels of our courts, our fellow prosecutors, and the vast system of careerists that serve America to provide for the rule of the law and the respect we have for the Constitution.\nWARNER: I humbly acknowledge my gratitude for having received that same benefit that he did because the Department of Justice is known, perhaps more so than any other department save the Department of Defense, for a cadre of careerists who put the rule of law and their oath to the Constitution foremost in discharging their responsibilities.\nI mentioned that having had that same experience, I had the opportunity in later life when I was privileged to be here in the Senate working in association with my good colleague here to recognize the judge, a circuit federal circuit judge in the nation's capital, for whom I served as a law clerk, Judge E. Barrett Prettyman, and naming the courthouse for him, and later joining again with my colleague to my left to name the next addition to the federal courthouse for a man named William Bryant.\nNow, William Bryant was a prosecutor, in a sense a career one, a defense counsel, and as a young man in the prosecutor's office, I learned more from William Bryant as to how to try a case and the vagaries of appearing before the jury and the trial judges than from any law professor in my career.\nSo that was the way I acknowledged the careerists. Our distinguished nominee in his opening statement will do likewise. But it is essential -- and this nominee will do that -- it is essential to protect those careers in the operations and functions they have in the Department of Justice from the always present political pressures that exist in every single corner of the nation's capital and the government. He will protect them so that they can perform their duties.\nHe will be the principal adviser to the president, and much has been said in the opening statements by both of my distinguished colleagues, chairman and ranking member, about the importance of the rule of law and independence.\nAnd I went back and read the Congressional Record, Senator Specter, where you delivered quite an oration here on the sixth of January this year. And in it you said the following: \"The attorney general is unlike any other cabinet officer whose duty is to carry out the president's policy. The attorney general has the corollary independent responsibility\" -- I repeat \"independent responsibility\" -- \"to the people to uphold the rule of law.\"\nThen joining the distinguished chairman, you wrote the following, the two of you: \"The attorney general's duty is to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, not to circumvent them. The president and the American people are best served by an attorney general who gives sound advice and takes responsible action.\"\nThat is the nominee, in my judgment.\nI was so privileged to join so many distinguished lawyers whom I've known and served with who have come forth, unsolicited, largely Republican in background, who have served as deputy attorney general, as prosecutors from all over the country, to lend our support to this important hearing. I would hope that, and ask if I might put in as a part of my...\nLEAHY: Without objection, they'll be part of the record.\n(CROSSTALK)\nWARNER: ... some of those exceptional letters. But I point out, again, my pride to have joined with them, most of them having far more distinguished legal careers than I have.\nBut it's interesting, Mr. Chairman, as I read those letters, they had a common theme in describing this nominee. It was in several of the letters. It was very simple but very profound. And it's stated as follows, and I quote them: \"Eric Holder is a good man.\" Now, that says a lot.\nI further note that our forty-first president, George Herbert Walker Bush, in a public appearance on television when asked about the president, he said, I wish the new president well. And then his son, our current president, likewise, has wished this president well.\nThis president has made a choice. This president has chosen an individual that's going to come before you momentarily in advise and consent. It's the gravity of the times that gives rise to the unprecedented level of bipartisanship that accompanies all stages of formation of this new administration and this historic inauguration to be next week.\nI thank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Warner.\nYou and I have sat on the inaugural stand for inaugurations for both Democrats and Republicans as president. And I think we have both wished whoever, whichever party they were from, wished them well.\nCongresswoman Norton, I want to recognize you. You were recently elected by the people of the District of Columbia to your eleventh consecutive term in the House of Representatives. And, please, Congresswoman Norton, go ahead.\nNORTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd unrelated to my own testimony, I've been asked by the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus to request that her letter for the caucus in support of Mr. Holden be admitted into the record. LEAHY: I thank you. It will be. Senator Feinstein had already sent that letter and asked that it be part of the record. I've read the letter. It definitely will be part of the record.\nNORTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman, it is a particular pleasure to appear before you this morning with my good friend whom I miss already. The fact that John Warner, who enjoys such a sterling reputation in this body, has stood for Eric Holder, I think, speaks volumes about Mr. Holder's experience and character.\nConsidering your time restraints, I'm going to read my thoughts this morning, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Specter.\nNORTON: I'm pleased to introduce Eric Holder, a longtime resident of the District of Columbia. But my few words this morning have little in common with the predictable introductions of home state senators and others.\nI did not know Eric Holder until he competed for the post of United States attorney for the District of Columbia. I came to know him in much the same way that you will know him after today's hearing.\nBecause the district has the same federal officials as the states but no senators, President Bill Clinton granted me the courtesy to recommend the U.S. attorney district court judges and the U.S. marshal.\nIn the district's two centuries as the nation's capital, residents have had to live with the decisions of these important federal officials while having no way to affect their appointments. I was determined to vindicate the president's courtesy by the transparency and the competitiveness of the process and the excellence of the candidates recommended.\nI appointed a commission of distinguished lawyers and other private citizens, named as chair Pauline Schneider, a past president of the District of Columbia Bar, and charged the commission to search widely for candidates and to thoroughly investigate and interview them and send me three candidates for each post.\nI then made my recommendations to the president for each post after doing my own due diligence and interviewing each of the three candidates.\nSome may think that Washington has more lawyers than people with good sense. But lawyers in this town are among the most able in the United States. The commission soon heard from some of the best of the lot.\nEric Holder's distinguished biography is before you. Without reiterating the many features of the academic and legal background that recommend his appointment, what particularly stood out for us were the uniformly excellent reports concerning his work in the Justice Department's first Public Integrity Section; his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to the D.C. Superior Court, whose appointments as Article I judges are made by the president, and the high praise for his service there; the outstanding evaluations of his extensive and varied criminal and civil trial experience; and his unimpeachable character and collegiality, as reported by all who had worked with Eric Holder.\nPerhaps the best indication of Eric's excellence, however, is that in a very competitive pool of the best and the brightest, he rose to the top like cream in rich milk.\nBesides demonstrating his own excellence, however, Eric carried an unusual burden of which he was unaware. More than usual, the quality of the commission's recommendations for U.S. attorney and for judges was of pathbreaking importance. We knew that these appointments were without precedent in the city's history. Even small differences in quality mattered if the point was not only to get the best candidates but to demonstrate that this city could do so.\nEric Holder created a new gold standard for the position of United States attorney for the District of Columbia. The republican U.S. attorneys who followed him adopted his innovations localizing the district's part of his jurisdiction by, for example, placing assistant U.S. attorneys in communities for the very first time while strenuously carrying forward significant federal prosecutions.\nEric wore two very different high-profile hats at the same time with remarkable skill. He more than vindicated the challenge he was given and our confidence in him.\nEric Holder may be the first person to work his way up from career trial attorney in the Department of Justice to become the United States attorney general. Imagine the effect his appointment will have on the demoralized Department of Justice staff.\nIf experience at every level of the department and the record of excelling in everything you have ever done matters to this committee, Eric Holder is unusually well qualified to become our attorney general.\nI am pleased and proud to recommend him to you without reservation.\nLEAHY: Well, congresswoman, you and I have served together for over 20 years, and I worked closely with you on a number of things. And that is high praise indeed, and I appreciate it.\nSenator Warner, I know you and the congresswoman have many other places to go. Thank you for taking the time here.\nWe'll rearrange the dais a little bit, and give Mr. Holder a chance.\nMr. Holder, will you please stand and raise your right hand.\nDo you affirm or swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\nHOLDER: I do.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nPlease be seated.\nI'm never sure whether to address you as Mr. Holder or Judge Holder, Deputy Attorney General Holder. But Mr. Holder, please go ahead and give your opening statement.\nFirst, before you do, though, would you introduce the members -- before we set the clock, introduce the members of your family? I've already met them, but so all the members of the committee can see them here.\nHOLDER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSeated behind me and right behind me is my wife, Dr. Sharon Malone. The beautiful woman to her left is my mother, Miriam Holder. The series of beautiful young women here is my daughter, Maya Holder, Brooke Holder. My little guy there, that's Eric Holder III, born on the same day as my father. He was going to have a different name, but we decided since he was born on my dad's birthday, his last birthday, that that had to be his name. So he's not named after me; he's named after my dad. That's my brother, William Holder, his wife, Deborah (ph) Holder, my niece, Amanda Holder.\nLEAHY: Thank you all. And I know you have many, many friends. I see former FBI director Louis Freed in the front row and I see so many others. Please, Mr. Holder, go ahead.\nHOLDER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, and members of the Judiciary Committee. I am deeply honored to appear before you today.\nIn five days, just a short distance from his historic room, the next president of the United States will take the oath of office. He will swear to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nI have been asked by him to serve as attorney general, the Cabinet officer who is the guardian of that revered document. I feel the full weight of this responsibility. If confirmed by the Senate, I pledge to you and to my fellow citizens that I will faithfully execute my duties as attorney general of the United States of America. I will do so by adhering to the precepts and principles of the Constitution. And I will do so in a fair, just, and independent manner. This is the fourth time I have come before the Senate for confirmation to a position in law enforcement. I served almost 30 years as a prosecutor, judge, and senior official within the Department of Justice.\nPresident-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden asked me to assume this responsibility because they know I will fight terrorism with every available tool at my disposal and reinvigorate the department's traditional missions of protecting public safety and safeguarding our precious civil rights.\nI accept their trust in me and, with your support, I intend to lead an agency that is strong, independent, and worthy of the name the Department of Justice. Now, I could not have arrived at this moment without the sacrifice and example of so many others.\nI begin, of course, by recognizing the support of my family who you've just met. My wife Sharon, a respected professional in her own right, has put up with a lot over the years because of my demanding work. And she has done so with the love and grace that characterizes all that she does.\nThank you, sweetheart.\nMy wife is a tremendously talented physician. But the best example of her skills and qualities as a person are on display not in her doctor's office but in our home in the form of our three children. They make our lives infinitely richer, and I thank them for their love and patience.\nIt wasn't until I was a parent myself that I truly appreciated all that my parents did for me. My father, only 12 years old when he came to this country from Barbados, worked hard throughout his life to teach my brother and me about the promise of America. He and my mother made sure that we never wasted the opportunities presented to us especially in education in the excellent New York City public school system.\nMy brother grew up to be a Port Authority police officer and a successful businessman. And I grew up to arrive at this humbling moment. I'm glad my mother is here to see had I day. I know my father would be proud.\nIn addition to my family, there are others who have inspired and guided me. Sitting here today, the very day that civil rights leader, Martin Luther King, would have celebrated his 80th birthday, I acknowledge the debt that I owe him and thousands of other Americans, black and white, who fought and died to break the back of segregation.\nDr. King devoted himself to breathing life into our Constitution. I feel privileged just to stand in his shadow and hope that, as attorney general, I can honor his legacy.\nNow, one of those who served on the front lines of the struggle for equality was my late sister-in-law, Vivian Malone Jones, who integrated University of Alabama in 1963. In an atmosphere of hate almost unimaginable to us today, she and fellow student James Hood faced down Governor George Wallace and in the presence of then deputy attorney general, Nicholas Katzenbach, they enrolled in that great university.\nThe very next day, NAACP leader, Medgar Evers, was gunned down in his driveway in Mississippi. But Vivian never considered backing down. She went to class despite the ever-present danger late saying simply that she decided not to show any fear. She never did throughout her too-short life.\nIn a career in public service that began the civil rights division in the Department of Justice and ended as an advocate for environmental justice, she showed me the meaning of courage and perseverance.\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the thousands of career employees at the Department of Justice. They have been my teachers, my colleagues, and my friends. When I first joined the department's public integrity section in 1976, they showed me what it meant to serve the people.\nWhen I was the United States attorney in the District of Columbia, they worked beside me to fight drug crimes, drug trafficking, and public corruption. And when I was deputy attorney general of the United States, they were my troops in the daily battle for justice.\nThese career professionals are not only the backbone of the Department of Justice, they are its soul. If I am confirmed as attorney general, I will listen to them, respect them, and make them proud of the vital goals we will pursue together.\nIn fact, if I have the honor of becoming attorney general, I will pursue a very specific set of goals. First, I will work to strengthen the activities of the federal government and protect the American people from terrorism. Nothing I do is more important. I will use every available tactic to defeat our adversaries, and I will do so within the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.\nAdherence to the rule of law strengthens security by depriving terrorist organizations of their prime recruiting tools. America must remain a beacon to the world. We will lead by strength. We will lead by wisdom. And we will lead by example.\nSecond, I will work to restore the credibility of a department badly shaken by allegations of improper political interference. Law enforcement decisions and personnel actions must be untainted by partisanship.\nUnder my stewardship, the Department of Justice will serve justice not the fleeting interests of any political party.\nAttorney General Mike Mukasey and Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip have done much to stabilize the department and restore morale. For that, Judges Mukasey and Filip deserve the gratitude of the American people, and they have my personal gratitude and thanks. But there is more work to do.\nThird, I will reinvigorate the traditional missions of the Justice Department. Without ever relaxing our guard in the fight against global terrorism, the department must also embrace the historic role in fighting crime that it has, in protecting civil rights, preserving the environment, and ensuring fairness in the marketplace.\nTo that end, the Justice Department must wage an aggressive effort against financial fraud and market manipulation. As taxpayers are asked to rescue large segments of our economy, they also have a right to demand accountability for wrongdoing that only the Department of Justice can provide.\nAt the same time, we must rededicate ourselves to the fight against violent crime which tears at the fabric of our neighborhoods.\nThe Justice Department must also defend the civil rights of every American. In the last eight years, vital federal laws designed to protect rights in the workplace, the housing market, and the voting booth have languished. Improper political hiring has undermined this important mission. That must change. And I intend to make this a priority as attorney general.\nThe Department of Justice must also protect American consumers. We need smart anti-trust enforcement to prevent and punish unlawful conduct that hurts markets, excludes competition, and harms consumer welfare. The Justice Department shall also reinvigorate its efforts to protect the public in areas such as food and drug safety and consumer product safety.\nAnd we must work actively with the EPA and other agencies to protect our environment.\nIn all of this, I hope to establish a full partnership with this committee and with Congress as a whole. The checks and balances in our Constitution establish a healthy tension among the three branches as each ensures that the other do not overstep their boundaries. But too often in recent years, that natural tension has expressed itself in unhealthy hostility.\nPresident-elect Obama and I respect Congress and we respect the federal judiciary. We will carry out our constitutional duties within the framework set forth by the founders and with the humility to recognize that congressional oversight and judicial review are necessary. They are beneficial attributes of our system and of our government.\nIn particular, I know how much wisdom resides in this committee from your collective decades of service in government. And I'll be sure to draw upon it.\nThe years I spent in government taught me a lot. As a public corruption prosecutor, I took on powerful interests to ensure that citizens receive the honest services of the people who serve them. As a judge, I used the awesome power I had to deprive criminals of their liberty, a power that weighs heavily on anyone who exercises it.\nAnd as a high-ranking official in the Department of Justice, I faced a series of complex, time-sensitive, prosecutorial, and administrative decisions every time I stepped inside the building.\nNow, my decisions were not always perfect. I made mistakes. I hope that enough of my decisions were correct to justify the gratifying support that I have received from colleagues in law enforcement in recent weeks. But with the benefit of hindsight, I can see my errors clearly and I can tell you how I learned from them.\nI can also assure you that I will bring to the office the principle that has guided my career. That the Department of Justice, first and foremost, represents the people of the United States not any one president, not any political party, but the people of this great country.\nI learned that principle in my first days at the department when I sent corrupt public officials from both parties to jail. It guided my work as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia when I prosecuted one of the most powerful members of my own party at the very time he held in his hands a top legislative initiative of my own president.\nAnd it guided my service as deputy attorney general when I recommended independent counsel investigations not just of members of the Cabinet but of the very president who appointed me and in whose administration I proudly served.\nNone of those calls was easy, but I made them because I believe they were the right decisions under the law. If confirmed as attorney general, I pledge to you that the same principle will guide my service and inform every decision that I make.\nI have spent most of my career at the Department of Justice and I cherish it as an institution. Its history, its spirit, its people, and its sense of integrity are unmatched within the federal government. If I have the honor of serving as attorney general, I will uphold the trust that you have placed in me.\nI will do so by ensuring the department is an instrument of our great Constitution but more than that, the servant of the American people.\nThank you very much.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Holder. We'll have the first round of ten-minute questions.\nWater boarding has been recognized to be torture since the time of Spanish Inquisition. The United States has prosecuted American soldiers for using this technique. Earlier in the last century, they prosecuted Japanese soldiers for using it on Americans in World War II. But the two most recent nominees to serve as attorney general of the United States hedged on the question of water boarding.\nThey would not say that if an American were water boarded by some other government or terrorist anywhere in the world, whether it would be torture and illegal. They maintained it would depend upon the circumstances.\nDo you agree with me that water boarding is torture and illegal?\nHOLDER: If you look at the history of the use of that technique used by the Khmer Rouge, used in the inquisition, used by the Japanese and prosecuted by us as war crimes. We prosecuted our own soldiers for using it in Vietnam.\nI agree with you, Mr. Chairman, water boarding is torture.\nLEAHY: Do you believe that other world leaders would have the authority to authorize the torture of United States citizens if they deemed it necessary for their national security?\nHOLDER: No, they would not. It would violate the international obligations that, I think, all civilized nations have agreed to at the Geneva Conventions.\nLEAHY: Do you believe that the president of the United States has authority to exercise a commander-in-chief override and immunize acts of torture? I ask that because we did not get a satisfactory answer from Former Attorney General Gonzales on that.\nHOLDER: Mr. Chairman, no one is above the law. The president has a constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. There are obligations that we have as a result of treaties that we have signed -- obligations, obviously, in the Constitution. Where Congress has passed a law, it is the obligation of the president, or the commander-in-chief, to follow those laws.\nThe president acts most forcefully and has his greatest power when he acts in a manner that's consistent with the congressional intent -- consistent with congressional intentions and directives.\nIf one looks at the various statutes that have been passed, it is my belief that the president does not have the power that you've indicated.\nLEAHY: The reason I asked that, just yesterday, here in the \"Washington Post,\" you see it says, \"Detainee tortured,\" says U.S. official. Trial overseer cites abusive methods against 9/11 suspect.\nNow, that's the convening authority for the military commissions, a top Bush administration official, in charge of deciding whether to bring Guantanamo Bay detainees to trial. Wouldn't refer an important case for trial, because, as she said, we tortured the detainee involved.\nI'm glad to see we now have a nominee for attorney general who is unequivocal on this.\nNow, one substantive criticism I've heard of your position on important issues stems from a brief you signed onto before the Supreme Court decided the case of District of Columbia v. Heller. The Supreme Court has now clarified the law in that area.\nAnd for those who may wonder, the Heller case, the Court recognized the personal right to bear arms guaranteed in the Second Amendment of the Constitution. It expressly held for the first time that the Bill of Rights includes this right among its guarantees of individual liberty and freedom.\nAs I told you, Mr. Holder, I am a gun owner, as a very large percentage of people in my state of Vermont are. My own home in Vermont, I enjoy target shooting. And before anybody asks, our nearest neighbor is over a half-a-mile away, and it's our son.\nBut do you accept and understand that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms? HOLDER: I understand that the Supreme Court has spoken. The amicus brief that I signed on to recited the history of the Justice Department's positions that had been taken prior to the Heller decision.\nAlso expressed the belief in that amicus brief, that was signed by a number of other Justice Department officials, that it was our view, looking at the Second Amendment and looking at the applicable case law, that the Second Amendment did not confer an individual right.\nThe reality is now that the Supreme Court has spoken. And that is now the law of the land.\nI respect the Supreme Court's decision. And my actions as attorney general, should I be confirmed, will be guided by that Supreme Court decision.\nLEAHY: Last year, for the first time in our history, this committee reported media shield legislation, a bipartisan 15-to-four vote in the Senate, in the committee.\nWe -- this legislation provided qualified privilege. It allows journalists to maintain confidentiality of their sources. And reasonable exceptions, of course, prevent terrorism and protect national security and personal safety.\nIf you are confirmed as attorney general, will you work with both Republicans and Democrats on this committee on a federal media shield law?\nHOLDER: Yes, I will, Mr. Chairman. It is my belief that a carefully crafted law to shield the press in the way that you have described is appropriate.\nNow, there are concerns that I'm sure will be expressed by people in the Justice Department, and I want to talk to the career folks in the department.\nI'd also want to ensure that, with the passage of any law, that we would still have the capacity to protect the national security and to prosecute any leaks of intelligence information that might occur.\nBut with those caveats, and with the ability to interact with people in the department, I am in favor of the concept of such a law.\nLEAHY: Now, you're very familiar with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. They're supposed to provide fair, impartial, independent legal advice for the executive branch.\nNow, the press reports and our own hearings have shown that they have -- it's been used most recently to advance extreme theories of executive power. We've seen it in torture, warrantless wiretapping, and so on.\nWill you, if you're confirmed as attorney general, commit to undertake a comprehensive review of all OLC opinions currently in effect, and to correct and withdraw any that have what appear to be incorrect or problematic analyses? Understand, these opinions really carry, de facto, the weight of law throughout the executive branch.\nHOLDER: Yes. I will make that pledge.\nIt is important that these OLC opinions -- which are so important, as you described -- that they truly reflect what the law is, that they reflect our values. And I want to ensure that any OLC opinions that are in effect are consistent with those two purposes.\nAnd I'll do so respecting the fact that OLC respects the notion of stare decisis, that we don't change OLC opinions simply because a new administration takes over.\nThe review that we would conduct would be a substantive one and will reflect the best opinions of probably the best lawyers in the department as to where the law should be, what their opinion should be. It will not be a political process. It will be one based solely on our interpretation of the law.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nNow, some senators, following -- and including commentators like Karl Rove -- have spoken extensively about your role in the pardon of fugitive Mark Rich at the end of President Clinton's second term. And I was very critical of that pardon at the time, notwithstanding the president's constitutional right to pardon people. Probably been critical of a number of different presidents' use of that constitutional right.\nYou have also publicly said you wish you'd handled the issue differently. Details of this matter have been exhaustively hashed out in several congressional hearings. The Congress has spent millions of dollars looking into this.\nYou appeared voluntarily and repeatedly to testify on the matter -- something we haven't seen from officials of the current administration.\nSo, I want to give you a chance to address the suggestion by some that, based on your actions, you are not independent, you would not be able to say \"no\" to a president that might nominate you. And I have a two-part question to you.\nHow do you respond to those that say the Mark Rich pardon shows you do not have the character to be an independent attorney general? And what did you learn from that experience?\nHOLDER: As I indicated in my opening statement, I made mistakes. And my conduct, my actions in the Rich matter was a place where I made mistakes.\nI have never said anything other than that. I appeared before two congressional committees and said nothing but that.\nI've accepted the responsibility of making those mistakes. I've never tried to hide. I've never tried to blame anybody else.\nWhat I've always said was that, given my -- given the opportunity to do it differently, I certainly would have.\nI should have made sure that everybody, all the prosecutors in that case, were informed of what was going on. I made assumptions that turned out not to be true. I should have not spoken to the White House and expressed an opinion without knowing all of the facts with regard to that matter.\nThat was and remains the most intense, most searing experience I've ever had as a lawyer. There were questions raised about me that I was not used to hearing.\nI've learned from that experience. I think that, as perverse as this might sound, I will be a better attorney general, should I be confirmed, having had the Mark Rich experience.\nI've learned that I have to ensure that there is full consultation with all the prosecutors who are involved in those kinds of matters. I can't assume that that, in fact, will happen. I have to make sure that it happens.\nI think we have to work to improve the pardon process within the Department of Justice. It appears that at the end of every administration, there seems to be a deterioration in the process. And so, I think we have to work on the Justice Department side to make sure that the rules and regulations are followed.\nIt was something that I think is not typical of the way in which I've conducted myself as a careful, thoughtful lawyer. As I said, it is something where I made mistakes, and I learned from those mistakes.\nLEAHY: And, of course, the pardon was issued by President Clinton, not by you.\nBut what I want to do -- and I have talked this over with Senator Specter -- obviously, Senator Specter is next. I will then recognize senators by seniority back and forth in the usual way, if they are here. If a senator misses their turn, then they would be put in the next time they appear.\nSenator Specter?\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, pursuing the issue of the Rich pardon, you are a high-level professional, outstanding record. No doubt about your professional judgment. And the comment that it's a mistake is one way of approaching it.\nBut when you take a look at the hard facts, it's a little hard for me to see how you came to the conclusion you did, even conceding the fact that none of us is perfect.\nIn the Rich matter, he was charged with trading with the enemy. He reached a deal with the Khomeini regime during the Iranian hostage crisis to purchase Iranian oil in exchange for arms, automatic rifles and handheld rockets. He was involved in trading with the Soviet and Iranian oil to the apartheid government, reprehensible apartheid government, in exchange for Namibian uranium, which was sold back to the Soviet Union, reportedly involved with Castro's efforts to escalate its nuclear war program in 1991, and with respect to a uranium deposit in western Cuba.\nHe had contributed very large sums to the Democratic Party -- $867,000 -- to the Clinton Library $450,000, $63,000-plus to others.\nAnd in this context, the House committee found that you recommended Jack Quinn, had told Jack Quinn, who was former White House counsel, he would not have to provide a copy of the petition, that he could go directly to the White House, which circumvented the normal pardon procedures.\nAnd you had the pardon attorneys opposed to it. Margaret Love said \"no.\"\nThe House committee came to these conclusions. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that Eric Holder was deliberately assisting Quinn with the Rich petition, and deliberately cut the rest of the Justice Department out of the process to help Quinn obtain the pardon for Mark Rich. This conclusion is supported by an e-mail sent by Quinn to Kitty Behan, and others, three days before Quinn's meeting with Holder on November 21st.\nAnd this is the confirmation e-mail. Subject, Eric, quote, spoke to him last evening. He says, go straight to the White House. Also says timing is good. And SHD -- should get in soon. Will elaborate when we speak.\nNow, I've had some experience with fugitives. And when you deal with a fugitive, it seems to me you focus on an extradition warrant.\nGiven the background of this man, it's hard to brush it off, it seems to me, as a mistake. The guy had a reprehensible record. The guy was a fugitive.\nThe indicators are, our House finding, that you were very heavily involved, and yet you testified you were only casually involved -- the question of candor on that comment. And then you had a president who obviously wanted to grant a pardon.\nHOLDER: Mr. Chairman, no one is above the law. The president has a constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. There are obligations that we have as a result of treaties that we have signed -- obligations, obviously, in the Constitution. Where Congress has passed a law, it is the obligation of the president, or the commander-in-chief, to follow those laws.\nThe president acts most forcefully and has his greatest power when he acts in a manner that's consistent with the congressional intent -- consistent with congressional intentions and directives.\nIf one looks at the various statutes that have been passed, it is my belief that the president does not have the power that you've indicated.\nLEAHY: The reason I asked that, just yesterday, here in the \"Washington Post,\" you see it says, \"Detainee tortured,\" says U.S. official. Trial overseer cites abusive methods against 9/11 suspect.\nNow, that's the convening authority for the military commissions, a top Bush administration official, in charge of deciding whether to bring Guantanamo Bay detainees to trial. Wouldn't refer an important case for trial, because, as she said, we tortured the detainee involved.\nI'm glad to see we now have a nominee for attorney general who is unequivocal on this.\nNow, one substantive criticism I've heard of your position on important issues stems from a brief you signed onto before the Supreme Court decided the case of District of Columbia v. Heller. The Supreme Court has now clarified the law in that area.\nAnd for those who may wonder, the Heller case, the Court recognized the personal right to bear arms guaranteed in the Second Amendment of the Constitution. It expressly held for the first time that the Bill of Rights includes this right among its guarantees of individual liberty and freedom.\nAs I told you, Mr. Holder, I am a gun owner, as a very large percentage of people in my state of Vermont are. My own home in Vermont, I enjoy target shooting. And before anybody asks, our nearest neighbor is over a half-a-mile away, and it's our son.\nBut do you accept and understand that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms? HOLDER: I understand that the Supreme Court has spoken. The amicus brief that I signed on to recited the history of the Justice Department's positions that had been taken prior to the Heller decision.\nAlso expressed the belief in that amicus brief, that was signed by a number of other Justice Department officials, that it was our view, looking at the Second Amendment and looking at the applicable case law, that the Second Amendment did not confer an individual right.\nThe reality is now that the Supreme Court has spoken. And that is now the law of the land.\nI respect the Supreme Court's decision. And my actions as attorney general, should I be confirmed, will be guided by that Supreme Court decision.\nLEAHY: Last year, for the first time in our history, this committee reported media shield legislation, a bipartisan 15-to-four vote in the Senate, in the committee.\nWe -- this legislation provided qualified privilege. It allows journalists to maintain confidentiality of their sources. And reasonable exceptions, of course, prevent terrorism and protect national security and personal safety.\nIf you are confirmed as attorney general, will you work with both Republicans and Democrats on this committee on a federal media shield law?\nHOLDER: Yes, I will, Mr. Chairman. It is my belief that a carefully crafted law to shield the press in the way that you have described is appropriate.\nNow, there are concerns that I'm sure will be expressed by people in the Justice Department, and I want to talk to the career folks in the department.\nI'd also want to ensure that, with the passage of any law, that we would still have the capacity to protect the national security and to prosecute any leaks of intelligence information that might occur.\nBut with those caveats, and with the ability to interact with people in the department, I am in favor of the concept of such a law.\nLEAHY: Now, you're very familiar with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. They're supposed to provide fair, impartial, independent legal advice for the executive branch.\nNow, the press reports and our own hearings have shown that they have -- it's been used most recently to advance extreme theories of executive power. We've seen it in torture, warrantless wiretapping, and so on.\nWill you, if you're confirmed as attorney general, commit to undertake a comprehensive review of all OLC opinions currently in effect, and to correct and withdraw any that have what appear to be incorrect or problematic analyses? Understand, these opinions really carry, de facto, the weight of law throughout the executive branch.\nHOLDER: Yes. I will make that pledge.\nIt is important that these OLC opinions -- which are so important, as you described -- that they truly reflect what the law is, that they reflect our values. And I want to ensure that any OLC opinions that are in effect are consistent with those two purposes.\nAnd I'll do so respecting the fact that OLC respects the notion of stare decisis, that we don't change OLC opinions simply because a new administration takes over.\nThe review that we would conduct would be a substantive one and will reflect the best opinions of probably the best lawyers in the department as to where the law should be, what their opinion should be.

And then you had a president who obviously wanted to grant a pardon.\nSPECTER: Now, if this were some underling or somebody who wasn't too bright, or wasn't too experienced, you'd slough it off as a mistake. But given your experience and your background and your competency, and the surrounding circumstance of President Clinton looking for a cover, how do you -- how do you explain it beyond simply \"It's a mistake\"?\nHOLDER: Well, I don't mean to minimize what I did by calling it a mistake, or mistakes, in the fact that I take what I did seriously, and I've expressed regret for what I did consistently.\nI would not take as gospel everything that is contained in that House report. And we can certainly talk about the various things that they have said. I dispute...\nSPECTER: Well, what do you disagree with?\nHOLDER: Well, for instance, this notion that I recommended Mr. Quinn to the gentleman that I was sitting next to at a dinner. I mean, I think first...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSPECTER: Well, what did happen?\nHOLDER: Well, first there's the matter of fundamental fairness. I voluntarily appeared before that committee and was never asked that question. And yet that appeared in the report.\nIf you look at even the material that's contained in that report, you will see that after I supposedly made this recommendation to a person who I did not know -- and according to the report I said, \"You go hire a lawyer; that person comes to me; and we'll work it out.\" Now, I as deputy attorney general, according to this report, would have said to a perfect stranger, \"You come to me with a lawyer, and we'll work it out.\" I don't know what...\nSPECTER: What happened as to Quinn? OK, if you weren't asked about. Did you recommend Quinn? What are the facts, aside from what the House says?\nHOLDER: I did not recommend Mr. Quinn.\nAnd, again, if you look at the report you will see that the people who were trying to determine who a lawyer would be for Mr. Rich spent six months, interviewed a whole host of people after this dinner that I attended, before they decided on the representation. They interviewed a number of people in addition to Mr. Quinn before they made that decision.\nSPECTER: Well, you refer to a dinner. There has been a report that at that dinner you pointed to Quinn as a person to represent Rich. Is that not true?\nHOLDER: That is not correct.\nSPECTER: What is correct?\nHOLDER: I had a conversation with a gentleman, and he asked about what happens if somebody has a problem with the Justice Department. And I think, as best as I can remember, all I did was explain to him how the process worked, that there were levels of review -- levels of appellate review, for lack of a better term -- review within the department. If somebody has an issue with somebody in the field, there are measures that you can take with the person in the field and that the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., has ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the Justice Department, including those parts of the department that are the field.\nSPECTER: Are you saying that Quinn's name never came up?\nHOLDER: No, it did not.\nAnd if you look at the minority component of the report, there is some question as to whether or not the gentleman, whose name I now remember, Mr. Kecks (ph), even said what the majority says that he did say.\nSPECTER: Is it true that you told Quinn after he was in the case that he did not have to provide you with a copy of the petition?\nHOLDER: No, I think if you're referring to Mr. Quinn's e-mail that says I told him to go straight to the White House, that did not occur.\nSPECTER: Well, there's a separate point, a separate point that Quinn testified to that you said in response to his offer to provide a copy of the Rich pardon petition that you said you didn't have to. It goes to the issue as to whether anybody else in the department would've known about it.\nHOLDER: Yes, I'm sorry. Now I understand what you're -- yes. At a meeting that we had, I believe in November, Mr. Quinn indicated that that's what I told him after we'd had a meeting on something else.\nI don't remember that conversation, but I've never disputed that I might have said that to Mr. Quinn because I worked under the assumption that was true that pardon applications that were filed in the White House were routinely sent to the Justice Department. The White House sent matters for pardons -- referrals for pardons -- to the Justice Department because they are supposed to originate with the pardon attorney at the Justice Department. SPECTER: How do you explain this e-mail -- and I acknowledge it's not your e-mail, but it's a contemporaneous e-mail which Quinn sent saying, corroborating at least as far as he's concerned your statement \"Go directly to the White House; circumvent the Department of Justice.\" How do you explain that?\nHOLDER: It's difficult for me to explain that. I never told Mr. Quinn to go straight to the White House. That would've been, in some ways, illogical given the fact that things that went to the White House would come to the Justice Department in any case.\nI don't know what Mr. Quinn -- where he got that from. I don't know, you know, a conversation I had with him he misinterpreted something that I said. But I never told him go straight to the White House with that pardon application.\nSPECTER: Were you aware, Mr. Holder, of the atrocious record that Rich had in dealing with Khomeini and the Iranians at an (inaudible) nation and arms in exchange for oil in Oracas (ph)? Were you aware of this kind of a record this man had?\nHOLDER: No, I was not.\nAnd that was one of the mistakes that I made. I did not really acquaint myself with his record. I knew that the matter involved -- it was a tax fraud case; it was a substantial tax fraud case. I knew that he was a fugitive. I did not know a lot of the underlying facts that you have described. And as I said, that was a mistake.\nSPECTER: One last question on this round...\nLEAHY: I'll give you extra time for that, but that will -- I am going to try to keep close to the time on this. Then, go ahead.\nSPECTER: One last question: When the pardon attorney, Margaret Love, said \"Don't do it,\" did you ask her why she said that, which would've been an avenue to find out what an atrocious record this man had?\nHOLDER: Well, senator, with all due respect, Margaret Love was not the pardon attorney at the time that this matter was being considered. And the pardon attorney who was present at the time, Mr. Adams, never expressed an opinion about this, again, because he didn't have the material in front of him.\nSPECTER: I'll come back to this.\nLEAHY: Senator Kohl?\nKOHL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, you've been selected by the president-elect for a very important position, and for that you must be very grateful to him personally. But as we know, once you are confirmed you will not be his lawyer but the American people's lawyer. Your role among cabinet members is unique. Your first duty will be to the Constitution, to the rule of law and not to the president. In the minds of many people, Attorney General Gonzales stepped over that line and was perceived too much as the president's lawyer and not the people's.\nOne of your top priorities will be to restore the integrity of the Justice Department. Because of the U.S. attorney's firings and other scandals, the American people came to believe that the department's activities from law enforcement to hiring were driven too much by politics.\nHow can you assure us that you are the right person to restore the independence of the Justice Department, especially in light of the questions raised by your critics that you were not sufficiently independent of the White House in the Clinton administration?\nHOLDER: Senator, everything that I owe as a professional I owe to the Department of Justice. It is an institution that I love. I came into the department as a bright young lawyer, a fresh young lawyer out of Columbia University, into the honors program. I had the pleasure of working with the best lawyers, I think, in the world. I learned how to be a lawyer at the Justice Department.\nI understand that the attorney general is different from every other cabinet officer. Though I am a part of the president's team, I am not a part of the president's team in the way that any other cabinet officer is. I have a special and unique responsibility.\nThere has to be a distance between me and the president. The president-elect said when he nominated me that he recognized that, that the attorney general was different from other cabinet officers.\nI think if you look at my record, if you look at my career and the decisions that I have made, I have shown that I have the ability and, frankly, the guts to be independent of people who have put me in positions.\nPresident-elect Obama -- President Obama -- is not, I expect, going to ask me to do anything that would compromise what I should be doing as attorney general. But I want to assure you and the American people that I will be an independent attorney general. I will be the people's lawyer.\nKOHL: In light of what you just said, are you prepared if some issue comes up that is a matter of basic constitutional principles that you differ with the president on that you will resign your job?\nHOLDER: I do not think that that is a situation that I'll face. We have a president-elect who is a brilliant constitutional lawyer, a person with a great moral compass, a person who I think will take criticism and advice. And I would think that if we had a constitutional problem as significant as the one that you are describing in your hypothetical that we would somehow work it through.\nIf, however, there were an issue that I thought were that significant that would compromise my ability to serve as attorney general in the way that I have described, that as the people's lawyer, I would not hesitate to resign.\nKOHL: Mr. Holder, for decades this country has been looked up to around the world for its unwavering commitment to human rights and the rule of law. There is a growing consensus that the detention center at Guantanamo Bay has tarnished that image.\nWhile the past two attorneys general, the current secretaries of defense and state, and the president himself have publicly said that they would like to close Guantanamo, no steps as yet have been taken.\nMany of us were encouraged by press reports which suggest that a change will occur in this next administration. Shortly after taking office, the president-elect will reportedly issue an order to close the prison, but it does remain unclear how this will be done and how long it will take.\nCan you give us some indication about how you feel, or what your priorities will be, how long you believe it will take, and what we will do with those detainees?\nHOLDER: Yes, senator, Guantanamo will be closed.\nThe president-elect during the campaign made that promise. Steps are being taken as we speak to look at the manner in which that can occur.\nI will tell you this will not be an easy task. The physical closing of the facility is something that can be done relatively quickly. The question is, what will we do with the people who are there now -- roughly, I guess, 250 or so people?\nTo responsibly close the facility, I think that we have to understand who these people are, make an independent judgment of who they are based on an examination of the records that exist down there, so that we can treat them in an appropriate way.\nI think substantial numbers of those people can be sent to other countries safely. Other people can be tried in a jurisdiction and put in jail. And there are possibly going to be other people who we're not going to be able to try, for a variety of reasons, but who nevertheless are dangerous to this country. And we're going to have to try to figure out what we do with them.\nBut I think that review that we'll have to go through to figure out who these people are and in what categories they fit will take an extended period of time. And I think that is the thing that will prevent us from closing Guantanamo as quickly as I think we would like.\nBut I want to assure the American people that Guantanamo will be closed.\nKOHL: Mr. Holder, while the president and the vice president have called them \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" or \"special measures,\" as the facts have leaked out we now know that the White House authorized the abuse of prisoners in our custody. The administration admitted to using waterboarding, and press reports have suggested that sleep deprivation, extreme temperatures and other abusive techniques have also been authorized.\nThis administration, of course, has taken a different view with respect to their legality. They have maintained that they were advised by the Justice Department that all of the approved techniques were legal. They have had the backing of three attorneys general. According to press reports, former Deputy Attorney General James Comey reportedly said that the administration would be, quote, \"ashamed\" when the world eventually learned of these legal opinions.\nWill you put an end to the use of abusive interrogation techniques? What is your description of what they are? What can we hope to expect from you?\nHOLDER: Our Justice Department will adhere to the values that have made this nation great. It is the intention of the president- elect, it is my intention, to make sure that we have interrogation techniques that are consistent with who we are as Americans so that we don't do things that will serve as a recruiting tool for people who are our enemies.\nThe decisions that were made by the prior administration were difficult ones. It is an easy thing in some ways to look and in hindsight be critical of the decisions that they made.\nAnd yet, having said that, the president-elect and I are, I think, both worried, disturbed, by what we have seen, what we've heard. The pledge that he has made and that I will make is that we will make sure that the interrogation techniques that are sanctioned by the Justice Department are consistent with our treaty obligations, the Geneva Treaty obligations that we have, and will be effective at the same time.\nOne of the concerns that I have as I've talked to the generals and admirals who are responsible for interrogation techniques is what they have said is that some of these enhanced techniques do not necessarily produce good intelligence. And we'll want to make sure that whatever it is that we do produces intelligence that will be useful to us and help us in our fight against those who would do us harm.\nKOHL: Thank you.\nOne last question, and this relates to your ability to exercise your responsibilities independently of what the president may or may not like. He is reported, as you know, to have considerable skills as a basketball player.\n(LAUGHTER)\nKOHL: And you have indicated to me, when we met in my office, that you also are a person of considerable skill.\nIn the event -- in the event, Mr. Holder, he invites you to the gym for a little one-on-one, will you promise us and the American people that you will do everything in your power to defeat him as badly as you can?\n(LAUGHTER)\nMy vote depends on your answer.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHOLDER: Senator Kohl, he's 10 years younger than me.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHe plays a lot more frequently than I do. Having said that, I've got a New York City game.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI come from the city that produced Connie Hawkins, Kareem Abdul Jabar, Nate \"Tiny\" Archibald. I learned how to play ball in P.S. 127 in Queens. If you give me a little time and a little space to get back in shape, I think I could hang with him.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI don't think I'm ever going to be in a position to beat him nor do I think that would be a wise thing to do.\n(LAUGHTER)\nKOHL: Well said, sir.\nHOLDER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: I want you to know, Mr. Holder, I've been here 34 years for these hearings. That is the first time that question has ever been asked.\n(LAUGHTER) What we're going to do -- I was going to break for five minutes at this point. Senator Kyl has, as we all do, different things he's supposed to be at. So to accommodate him, what we'll do is we'll do his round and then we're going break for about five minutes and then come back.\nSenator Kyl?\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If that's all right with you, Mr. Holder -- and by the way, I think Herb may just be look for some new talent for the bucks. Be careful there.\n(LAUGHTER)\nIt's good to visit again. And I appreciated our decision in which we discussed a wide range of issues. And as I mentioned at that meeting, one of the first things I did like to do is to just have you state for the record your views and commitments you made regarding the whole series of issues that we discussed.\nThe first one relates to DNA. As we discussed last December, the Justice Department published regulations that require federal agencies to collect DNA samples from individuals who are arrested under federal authority and from illegal immigrants who are being deported.\nThe regulations require these agencies to collect DNA samples at the same time that they take fingerprints and mug shots. The Justice Department is charged with implementing and administering the new regulations. It's the department's job to ensure that the DNA samples are collected and analyzed.\nMr. Holder, if you're confirmed as attorney general, will you see to it that the new DNA regulations are enforced and that DNA samples are collected and analyzed as required under the new rules? And will you seek sufficient resources to implement the regulations?\nHOLDER: Yes, I will, Senator. The collection of that evidence is, I think, critical for crime solving. You use of DNA evidence is often seen as a way in which people who are charged with crimes are absolved. And that certainly is a beneficial effect. But I think, too often, people forget that the collection of this evidence is a very important crime-fighting tool.\nAnd so I will support those regulations. I think, as you indicated, it's entirely possible that one of the things that we're going to need are additional resources to make sure that we have the capacity, the ability to do that job in the way that Congress intended.\nKYL: And I'll do my best to help to make sure Congress supports the resource requirements.\nNext, capital habeas. As you know, in 2005, Congress passed an amendment that will implement the opt-in system for a faster review of state capital cases in federal courts. The amendment requires of U.S. attorney general to review whether states are providing counsel to capital defendants. With the review of the attorney general's decision and the D.C. Circuit Court, the state of Arizona will probably be interested in submitting such a petition for review.\nIf you are confirmed as attorney general, will you review the state of Arizona's application in a timely manner and make a timely determination of whether Arizona is providing counsel to capital defendants and post-conviction review?\nHOLDER: I will take my obligations seriously under those regulations and look at the evidence that the states provide with me that they have complied with the regulations. And to the extent the states do, I will give the relief that is dictated by those regulations.\nI want to make sure that, in fact, the resources in capital cases that the regulations call for are provided to defendants. But for states that actually do meet those requirements, I will check the necessary boxes.\nKYL: And what you stated, I think, is absolutely true. We're just interested that it doesn't drag on beyond the time that normal review process would require.\nNext, we talked some about FISA. One of the amendments to FISA deals with the so-called lone wolf terrorists. These are individuals who have believed to be involved in international terrorism but who we, at least, don't have any evidence that they are actually taking orders from a particular organization.\nAnd the provision was enacted specifically because of the FBI's previous inability to obtain a warrant to monitor Zacarias Moussaoui, the co-conspirator in the 9/11 plot who was arrested before the attacks but who could not be searched pursuant to FISA because despite his likely involvement in preparations for terrorism, agents could not link him to Al Qaida or any other group.\nThe lone wolf provision needs to be reauthorized by the end of this year. Will you support reauthorization of FISA's Lone Wolf Surveillance Authority?\nHOLDER: I expect that I will. There are three provisions that are up for reauthorization. What I'd like to do is examine how those provisions have worked, talk to people, investigators and lawyers, and get a sense of what it is they think has worked well with regard to those provisions, what perhaps needs to be changed.\nAt least a couple of those provisions were contained in a proposal that President Clinton made back in the late '90s and I went before a couple of congressional committees seeking their institution. One of them was lone wolf and the other had to do with roving surveillance.\nSo I would expect that, with regard to those, I would probably be supportive of them.\nKYL: And, in fact, let me just discuss this because we discussed all three. And these are the other two.\nOne is the reauthorization of the Patriot Act's multi-point wiretap authority and the other is reauthorization of Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\nWhen we discussed this, I neglected to note -- although you're probably aware -- that unlike the typical administrative subpoena, this requires a judicial approval before it's granted. First, with respect to the multi-point wiretap authority, would you support reauthorization of that?\nHOLDER: Again, I would like to have some interaction with the people who are responsible for the use of that tool. It's a very useful tool. And make sure they're satisfied with the way in which it is presently constructed. But I would expect that I would be able to support that.\nKYL: And with regard to Section 215 orders as well?\nHOLDER: That's one that I think has certainly generated more controversy, I believe, than the other two. And I think that the examination, the questions that I need to ask people in the field and who have been using that, I'd want to know as much as I possibly can.\nBut as I said, the tools that we have been given by Congress in FISA are important ones. And so I would look at all three of these and make the determination as to whether or not I will be able to support them. But I would expect that I would.\nKYL: We also discussed -- let's see here -- the operation streamline -- I'll tell you what. Before I ask that, we discussed the warrantless surveillance. Since that's somewhat related to this, you indicated that comments that you had made in a speech on June 13, 2008 were directed to the status of the law pre-FISA modifications from the legislative branch when Congress later -- I believe it was the next month -- modified the FISA law, there was an explicit type of search that was provided allowing warrantless monitoring of suspected communications of international terrorists predicated on the principle that the 4th Amendment gives greater leeway to intelligence investigations of foreign threats.\nDo you agree with that general principle? But more importantly, in the context of our conversation, do you believe the new law is constitutional? And if confirmed, will you support its enforcement?\nHOLDER: Yes, I believe that the law is constitutional. One of the things that I think is, in some ways, regrettable is that the program -- that I've not been read into and I don't know all the dimensions of it -- but as I understand it that program is a very useful tool. It's a very essential tool for us in fighting terrorism.\nI think that what was unfortunate is that we could have had that tool congressionally sanctioned at a much earlier stage. I think that, as we saw in the Steel Seizure concurrence of Justice Jackson, the president has his greatest power when he acts consistent with congressional directives. And I think that, in this instance, that's instructive.\nHad the administration come to Congress and asked for that enhanced authority many years before, I have no doubt that Congress would have granted him that tool. Having done that though and having had Congress say that this is an appropriate thing to do, I think, as I said, that is a very useful tool and one that we will make great use of.\nKYL: We discussed, in the context of illegal immigration, an operation called Operation Streamline by the Border Patrol. And there's a Department of Justice aspect to this.\nEssentially, that's been utilized in two Border Patrol sectors. A third one is now underway. I specifically discussed the Yuma border sector, for example. This is a situation where repeat illegal border crossers are put in jail for 30 days, sometimes it can be more if they've committed the crime over and over and over.\nAnd that resulted in extraordinary disincentive for them to try to cross illegally. In the Yuma border sector, for example, there's been a 93 percent reduction in border apprehensions after just two years and much of that, at least, Border Patrol attributes to this policy of jailing the people for 30 days.\nHowever, as with so many of these other things, it requires resources. And in that regard, a lot of the resources fall on the Department of Justice side. I hope I've gotten to you already, but I promised I would get you a letter from Judge John Roll who is the chief judge for the Arizona district, in which he outlines some of the requirements for additional judges, magistrates, U.S. marshals, prosecutors, defense attorneys, as well as the hearing space and detention facilities.\nAnd if you'd like to address all of those things individually, fine. But just as a general proposition, if you are confirmed, will you support the appointment of the additional personnel and the resources for the items that I mentioned to try to continue to expand Operation Streamline for as long as we may need that along our southern border in order to help deter illegal immigration?\nHOLDER: Senator, that was -- I did not -- I was not aware of that operation until you brought it to my attention during our meeting. I think it's actually a pretty interesting concept and, I think, one that ought to be explored and I'd want to work with you all to see if it's something that can be expanded.\nI think one component of it -- at least, as I understand it. You can correct me if I'm wrong -- for an initial -- the first time a person comes across, I don't think they're jailed. I think the person is warned and then is put in jail the second time?\nKYL: It's after the first crossing. In other words, it's for repeat offenders.\nHOLDER: Repeat offenders, yes. And I think that is something that is worth looking at.\nOne of the things that has always worried me is that a disproportionate share of what is a national problem is borne by the states along our southern border. Resources that need to be directed to what is, in essence, a national problem are too often not sent to the place where it is really needed. The states of Arizona and the other states along that border.\nSo my commitment would be to try to work with you, as I think we have in the past, to try to determine what resources are necessary and what programs would be good to try to affect a reduction in the number of illegal immigrants who come across those borders.\nKYL: I appreciate that. I just introduced your good friend and colleague, Governor Janet Napolitano, from Arizona in the Department of Homeland Security hearing. I think she and I have discussed this as well. So I look forward to the opportunity of working with both of you on trying to provide some additional deterrents to illegal border crossing.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nI might note, my friend from Arizona has raised some good points. Some of them we will probably have hearings on, especially, in renewal of legislation. I will work with Senator Kyl and senators on both sides of the aisle with that but especially these immigrations matters, senators who are from border states -- I see Senator Cornyn here and Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein is here.\nA few minutes ago -- I rely heavily on their own personal experience. Before we break, the committee has received letters of support for Mr. Holder's nomination from numerous major national law enforcement and criminal justice organizations.\nAmong those -- I am going to put these, without objection, put these letters into the record including the letters from the -- and these are letters in support, Mr. Holder, of your confirmation. Letters from the National Association of Police organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, the National Sheriffs Association, the American Probation and Parole Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International Union of Police Associations, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Black Prosecutors Association, the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Criminal Justice Association, the National District Attorneys Association -- I noticed that, especially, as I was once vice president of the National District Attorneys Association -- the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, the National Narcotic Officers Associations Coalition, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the National Organization of Police Officers, the National Troopers Coalition, the Police Executive Research Forum -- I think one gets the drift in these kind of -- they will be in the records.\nLEAHY: And with that, we will stand in a short recess.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: I'm always hesitant to ask photographers to back off, but I'm going to have to ask everybody to give me a little break here.\nWe are -- (inaudible) to understand what is going on here. We don't have Senator Kennedy with us this morning. He's -- the Cabinet nominations for the committee he chairs. I should note that he's not only a former chairman but he served on the Judiciary Committee longer than any senator in the nation's history. It's his 46th year of service on this committee.\nNow, we're also missing Senator Biden who made his valedictory address to the Senate this morning. We told Senator Biden, another former chairman of this committee, that we didn't mind him taking a drop-down position to become vice president. But we do miss him.\nAnd the next person we're going to hear from is Senator Feinstein, the senior senator from California. She's also the new chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. She's a very good friend of all of ours.\nAnd, Senator Feinstein, the floor is yours.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd, welcome, Mr. Holder.\nHOLDER: Good morning.\nFEINSTEIN: I hope shortly we'll be calling you Attorney General Holder.\nI would like to begin with something internal to the department. I want to ask you a quick question on Guantanamo.\nLEAHY: If the senator could hold just a moment so we can get rid of that feedback. And we'll start the clock again.\nFEINSTEIN: And about the use of contractors in carrying out interrogation techniques. But let me begin with this. The inspector general of the Department of Justice has, over the past year, put out four different reports which really revealed substantial politicization of the Department of Justice. The latest one just came out on January 13th. It was an investigation about allegations of politicized hiring and other improper personnel actions in the civil rights division.\nIt points out that a Bradley Schlossman, a political appointee in the civil rights division, had been screening applicants for career positions based on their political briefs and had been removing disloyal lawyers from sections in the department to make way for, quote, real Americans.\nThe report also found that Schlossman made false statement in sworn testimony to this committee; namely, in direct response to questions the chairman put to him, the question that I put to him, and a question that Senator Schumer put to him.\nMy question is: Have you read this report? And if so, what actions can you take to follow up on it?\nHOLDER: I have not had a chance to read the report, Senator. And yet I have read the news accounts of it. What's contained in the report is very disturbing. The notion that the Justice Department would ever take into account a person's political affiliation or political briefs in making hiring decisions is antithetical to everything that the department stands for and everything that I'm familiar with.\nI served very proudly in the Justice Department under Republican attorneys general, Democratic attorneys general. And there was never a thought given to what your party affiliation was, what your political briefs were in hiring, in promotion decisions.\nWhat we have seen in that report, I think, is aberrant but is also, I think so, one of the major tasks the next attorney general is going to have to do is he has to reverse that.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, this document -- clear lying to this committee. And I believe that that's a violation of law. And I would hope that the Justice Department would take action. However you do it, I don't think we can do nothing to someone representing the government who comes before us and lies.\nHOLDER: Yes. I understand that prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in D.C. -- again, just based on the press reports -- actually reviewed the report and have made a prosecutive determination. If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as attorney general, I will indicate to you that I will review that determination.\nI don't know all the facts of the case. But given the findings in the inspector general's report that are consistent with what you have said, I want to know why the determination was made not to pursue charges, criminal charges.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nI listened carefully to your answers to Senator Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) question about Guantanamo. I also read the speech that you made in the middle of 2008 where you very clearly stated that it should be closed. And here you said it will be closed.\nLet me ask these questions about that. Do you believe military commissions are sufficient to prosecute detainees who have been declared enemy combatants and pose a danger to the national security of the United States?\nHOLDER: I don't think that the military commissions that we now have in place have all of the due process requirements that I would like to see contained in them. We have to come up with a system that will deal with those three categories of people that I described -- that I believe are contained at Guantanamo. Those who I think we can safely repatriate to other countries, those who we can try, and then deal with those who, perhaps, are too dangerous but nevertheless cannot be tried.\nIn trying to deal with those detainees who we will try, I think we have to examine what tools will be available to us, what forums will be available to us -- Article three courts, military courts, the possibilities exists, I suppose, that we could use military commissions. But they would have to be, I think, substantially revamped to provide the due process rights that I think are consistent with who we are as Americans.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, let me just discuss this with you. Assuming Guantanamo is closed and one of the big criticisms of Guantanamo has been that it's a hypocritical situation. One set of law applies to people at Guantanamo and another set of laws in the United States.\nSo assuming that the 80 or so -- well, however many detainees need to be relocated, can be relocated, we've checked with military and federal, supermax prisons and believe there is space for them. And they come to the United States. You would assume they would fall under regular federal law.\nDo you agree with that?\nHOLDER: I think we want to leave our options open. I don't know exactly what system we would put in place or what system we would utilize in order to try those people. This is something that, even as we speak, that we are trying to work through as an administration in anticipation of President-elect Obama becoming President Obama.\nBut the one thing I can assure you and the American people and, frankly, the world is that whatever system we use, it will be consistent with our values. It will be a system that has due process guarantees. It will be seen as fair.\nFEINSTEIN: Some of us -- Senator Whitehouse, myself, other senators have just introduced a bill that is in the Intelligence Committee which would close Guantanamo within 12 months which would essentially provide for a single standard for interrogation across the United States government, namely the Army Field Manual, and prohibit of use of contractors doing interrogation.\nLet me ask you about the Army Field Manual. As you know, it has been revised by the military. It is a comprehensive, thoughtful manual. It has more than a dozen different techniques. It is supported across the United States military and about 30 retired generals as being an adequate standard for the United States to use.\nDo you believe that the Army Field Manual should comprise the standard for interrogation across the United States government?\nHOLDER: Well, I have been impressed in my interactions with those generals and admirals as they've discussed what they are allowed to do under the terms of the Army Field Manuel, and how they don't think that the inability to do these enhanced interrogation techniques has in any way had a negative impact on, they think, their ability to get good intelligence.\nSo, my view is that, I think, starting with what we have in the Army Field Manuel, I think that's a good place for us to start. I personally think that the techniques that are outlined there are consistent with what we are supposed to do under Common Article 3 and the other parts of the Geneva Convention.\nAnd I'm not convinced at all that, if we restrict ourselves to the Army Field Manuel, that we will in any way be less effective in the interrogation that we do of people who have sworn to do us harm.\nThis is something that the president-elect is considering now, and giving all components an opportunity to express their views -- not only the military, but those on the intelligence side. If there's a contrary view, we want to give them an opportunity to make their case.\nBut it is my view, based on what I've had an opportunity to review and what I've been exposed to, that I think the Army Field Manuel is adequate.\nFEINSTEIN: Currently, all interrogation is done by contractors. CIA interrogation is done by contractors.\nAnd I wrote a letter to General Mukasey in the early part of last year, challenging this, because all inherently governmental activities under the law should be carried out by government employees. He wrote back saying that these contractors were not covered under that section of the law.\nI have a real issue with this.\nHave you had an opportunity to look at that? And can you comment?\nHOLDER: I'm not up to speed on that. But let me say this. The concern that you expressed, I think is a very legitimate one.\nI think, across the board, and especially when it comes to law enforcement functions interpreted pretty broadly, you want to have employees of our government who are conducting and doing law enforcement activities. This is not something that you want to farm out, that you want to give to people who are not sworn.\nIt doesn't mean that these people can't be trained and everything. But I think that, when it comes to core law enforcement responsibilities -- and interrogation, I would think, would be one of those -- I would like to, to the extent that is possible, restrict that.\nFEINSTEIN: There is...\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nFEINSTEIN: There is -- oh, my time is up. So short.\nThank you, Mr. Holder.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Feinstein.\nAnd I want to recognize next the senior senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, who is a longtime friend -- we have served here for decades -- and also former chairman of the committee. He has been a consistent supporter of the work of the Department of Justice.\nAnd Senator Hatch, it's yours.\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nCongratulations, Mr. Holder, on this appointment. Welcome back to the Judiciary Committee.\nThis is the fourth time that you have come to the Senate for confirmation, so far without a single negative vote. We just have to see if that continues, that trend.\nCandidly, there are some real issues and concerns, as you know. We've chatted about them. And you're chatting about them here. And I say that as someone who has said that I'm inclined to support your nomination.\nNow, in a speech last year, you stated, \"I never thought I would see that a president would act in direct defiance of federal law by authorizing warrantless NSA surveillance of American citizens. This disrespect for the law is not only wrong, it is destructive in our struggle against terrorism.\"\nNow, do you believe that the president has -- whoever is president of the United States -- has inherent authority under Article 2 of the Constitution to engage in warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance? Or, in your opinion, does FISA trump Article 2?\nHOLDER: Senator, no one is above the law. The president has the constitutional obligation to make sure that the laws are faithfully executed.\nIn rare instances where Congress passes a law that is obviously unconstitutional -- if, for instance, Congress were to pass a law that the secretary of defense should be the commander-in-chief, or that women would not have the right to vote -- I think that the president in that instance would have the ability to act contrary to a congressional dictate.\nBut the president has his power at its maximum, at its zenith, when he acts consistent with congressional direction. Now, when it comes to the FISA statute, there's an exclusivity provision in the FISA Act, that essentially says, as Congress has expressed, this is the exclusive way in which that kind of surveillance should occur.\nMy speech was taking the administration to task for not following the dictates of FISA.\nAs I indicated, I think, in response to a previous question, I think that, had the administration worked with Congress, as we are pledging to do, that that tool -- a very valuable tool, a very valuable tool -- could have been in the arsenal of the administration without any question about its legality.\nHATCH: How do you -- how do you reconcile your analysis of the Terrorist Surveillance Program with the longstanding precedents of Truong and Keith before an intelligence surveillance court reviews a decision in the In re Sealed Case, and the recent Second Circuit decision in the Wadi al-Haj case?\nHOLDER: Senator, I can't hear you too well.\nHATCH: Well, in the recent Second Circuit decision in the Wadi al-Haj case, I think it is.\nHOLDER: I'm sorry, sir. I didn't hear the whole question.\nHATCH: Well, I asked you, how do you -- I'm sorry. Maybe I can pull this thing forward.\nHow do you recognize your analysis of the TSP, Terrorist Surveillance Program, with these longstanding precedents, from Truong, Keith, In re Sealed and the Wadi al-Haj case?\nHOLDER: Well, senator, it's my belief that the statute lays out the means by which the president has the power, the executive branch has the power to do that type of surveillance.\nIt is, as I said, a very valuable tool. It is one that sets out very explicitly the means by which this can be done.\nIt seems to me that, it's incumbent upon anybody in the executive branch who is engaged in that kind of surveillance to be mindful of the dictates of FISA, and then to perform in that way.\nHATCH: Well, let me just ask this question. As the former deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration, were you part of the decision-making process of DOJ that authorized the warrantless search of the residents of spy Aldrich Ames, a U.S. citizen, in 1993? Do you believe that search at that time was illegal?\nHOLDER: Senator, I don't know all of the circumstances under which that occurred. I was not at Main Justice in '93. I was the U.S. attorney in D.C., so I didn't participate in '93, if that's when it occurred. I didn't participate in that decision. And I'm not familiar with all that might have happened.\nI don't know whether there were exigent circumstances. I don't know exactly what happened in connection with that.\nHATCH: OK. But back to our prior point, is the president's inherent authority under the Constitution -- can that be limited by a statute?\nHOLDER: The president's inherent authority. Well...\nHATCH: Right.\nHOLDER: ... it's...\nHATCH: I mean, you're relying on the statute as though that's binding on Article 2 of the Constitution.\nHOLDER: Well, the president obviously has powers under the Constitution that cannot be infringed by the legislative branch. That's what I was saying earlier.\nThere are powers that the president has, and that have been delegated to him that he has. And in the absence -- Congress does not have the ability to say, with regard to those powers, you cannot exercise them.\nThere's always the tension in trying to decide where that balance is struck. And I think we see the best result when we see Congress interacting with the president, the executive branch interacting with the legislative branch, and coming up with solutions...\nHATCH: That still doesn't negate the fact that the president may have inherent powers under Article 2 that eve a statute cannot vary.\nHOLDER: Well, sure. The...\nHATCH: Do you agree with that statement?\nHOLDER: Yes, there are certain things that the president has the constitutional right, authority to do, that the legislative branch cannot impinge upon.\nHATCH: OK.\nNow, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 included important civil liability protections for those providers who assisted the government with the Terrorist Surveillance Program in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Now, according to this act, in order for the liability protections to apply, the attorney general must first file a certification with the court. Now, last fall, Attorney General Mukasey filed the appropriate certifications with the court. You're aware of that. OK.\nNow, do you believe that those private partners who assisted the government should be given civil liability protection?\nHOLDER: Well, that is now contained in a statute. The duty of the Justice Department is to defend statutes that have been passed by Congress, unless there is some very compelling reason not to.\nPresident-elect Obama was against the -- immunity was granted to those ISPs, Internet service providers -- but nevertheless voted for the statute that contained that immunity. It would seem to me that unless there are compelling reasons, even given the opposition, unless there are compelling reasons, I would not -- I don't think that we would reverse course.\nHATCH: OK. So, if confirmed as attorney general, you will honor the certifications by Attorney General Mukasey.\nHOLDER: Yes, I believe that we would. Obviously, we have to look at if there are changed circumstances, if there is some basis to change that determination. But in the absence of that, I don't think we would.\nHATCH: Well, thank you.\nThere have been numerous calls for prosecution of various individuals, ranging from the vice president to attorneys at the Office of Legal Counsel, for their support or approval of the Terrorist Surveillance Program and the CIA's interrogation and detention program.\nNow, if confirmed as the attorney general, do you intend to undertake, order or support a criminal investigation of those individuals, including those individuals at the Office of Legal Counsel, who were involved in drafting legal opinions on these matters? Or are you willing to acknowledge that there can be differences of opinion, but they acted in accordance with their best good faith efforts under the circumstances at the time?\nHOLDER: Well, senator, no one is above the law. And...\nHATCH: I'll agree with that.\nHOLDER: We will follow the evidence, the facts, the law, and let that take us where it should.\nBut I think President-elect Obama has said it well. We don't want to criminalize policy differences that might exist between the outgoing administration and the administration that is about to take over. We certainly don't want to do that.\nHATCH: But would you consider these policy differences, or policy decisions?\nHOLDER: Well, one of the things I think I'm going to have to do is to become more familiar with what happened that led to the implementation of these policies. I've not been read into a variety of things that I will be exposed to, should I become attorney general. And that would, I think, better inform any decision that I would make in that regard.\nHATCH: OK.\nLet me just switch the subject -- I've got just another 40 seconds -- and explore your position -- well, let me just start with this.\nI want to ask you about the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. As you know, that's a matter of great concern. I've always been baffled by those who claim they see rights that are not in the Constitution at all, but cannot seem to see the rights that actually are expressly written there.\nYou have in the past, both as deputy attorney general and private citizen, stated your belief that the Second Amendment confers only a collective right to keep and bear arms, rather than an individual right.\nLast year you signed a friend of the court brief that took this position before the Supreme Court in the District of Columbia v. Heller case.\nNow, the Supreme Court rejected that position and held that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is an individual right.\nIn your -- in this hearing, who is right, you or the Supreme Court?\nHOLDER: In the ballgame that we...\nHATCH: That sounds like an unfair question...\nHOLDER: No, no. No, it's fair. In the ballgame...\nHATCH: ... (inaudible) but I just want (inaudible) point.\nHOLDER: ... that we call our judicial system, the Supreme Court gets to be the umpire. They call the balls and strikes.\nThey made the determination that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right. I will obviously respect that. And any actions I take as attorney general will take that into account.\nHATCH: The question I have then, were they correct, the Supreme Court?\nHOLDER: Well, you know, I will say that I think, based on Justice Department precedent, there was a good argument to be made in the amicus brief that we submitted. But I think it's one that I think lawyers can disagree on. And five justices of the Supreme Court have indicated what the Second Amendment is. And so, yes, they're right.\nHATCH: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate...\nLEAHY: Thank you very much, Senator Hatch.\nAnd before I recognize Senator Feingold, I've been trying to put these letters into the record. I mentioned the letters of support from the 130 law enforcement and criminal justice organizations, civil rights organizations, victims' advocates, legal practitioners and others.\nI'll now put into the record letters from several former officials, including a letter from the attorney general, the Republican attorney general under George H.W. Bush, William Barr, in support of you. And the assistant attorney general for the office of legal counsel under President Reagan and then the solicitor general under President George W. Bush, Ted Olsen; a former U.S. attorney, a Republican congressman, undersecretary for homeland security in the Bush administration, Asa Hutchinson; a Republican former congressman, Bob Barr; two former deputy attorneys general under President George W. Bush, Jim Coleman and Larry Thompson; a letter from former federal judge and FBI director, Louis Freeh, who was here earlier today; and then a number of other high-ranking Republican (inaudible) executive branch officials.\nWithout objection, those letters will be made part of the record.\nSenator Feingold is the chair of our Constitution Subcommittee. And Senator Feingold, I yield to you.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you. Thank you so much Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, welcome and congratulations on your nomination. I certainly appreciated your meeting with me on short notice a few weeks ago. And I look forward to many more fruitful discussions of the important issues facing the department should you be confirmed.\nAnd I would like to start with a topic that we discussed then and that you were just talking to Senator Hatch about. As you know, I've been very concerned about the extreme and wrong-headed legal theories that the outgoing administration came up with to justify assertions of executive power beyond what the Constitution allows.\nThese theories were developed by lawyers operating for Department of Justice in cooperation with lawyers from the White House counsel's office and the office of the vice president. They were used to justify actions by the executive branch, particularly in the areas of torture and warrantless surveillance that I believe were illegal and inexcusable.\nI voted against the confirmations of Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey because their answers on this key question, respect for the rule of law, were so troubling. So one of the things I'm looking for from you is a clear indication that the new administration and your Department of Justice will make an unmistakable break from the past when it comes to these issues.\nAnd I already heard you make the statement that those gentlemen didn't make which is the president is not above the law.\nSo I will ask you the same question I asked Mr. Gonzales. First, what is your view of the president's constitutional authority to authorize violation of the criminal law, duly enact the statutes that may have been on the books for many years when acting as commander-in- chief?\nHOLDER: The president, as I've said, is not above the law, has a constitutional obligation to follow the law and execute the laws that this Congress passes. If you look at the Steel Seizure concurrence of Justice Jackson that, I think, sets out in really wonderful form the power that the president has and where the president's power is strongest and where it is weakest.\nIt is weakest in Category 3 where Congress has indicated something contrary to what the president wants to do. That is where Justice Jackson says the president's power is at its lowest level. And I think -- I'm not a constitutional scholar -- but I think that there has never been a president who's been upheld when he's tried to act in Category 3. I think, but I'm not sure.\nFEINGOLD: I believe that's right. And I want to follow that. Using the construct of Justice Jackson, more specifically, does the president, in your opinion, have the authority, acting as commander- in-chief, to authorize warrantless searches of Americans homes and wiretaps of their conversations in violation of the criminal and foreign intelligence statutes of this country?\nHOLDER: I think you're then getting into Category 3 behavior by the president. Justice Jackson did not say that the president did not have any ability to act in Category 3. Although, as I said, I'm not sure there's ever been an instance where (inaudible) courts have said that the president did act appropriately in that category.\nIt seems to maybe it's difficult it imagine a set of circumstances given the hypothetical that you have used and given the statutes that you have referenced that the president would be acting in an appropriate way given the Jackson construct, when I think is a good one.\nFEINGOLD: So you see FISA law as under Category 3, right?\nHOLDER: Yes. I think the FISA law is a good statute and it has an exclusivity provision that seems to me to be pretty clear.\nFEINGOLD: You discussed with Senator Hatch whether or not there was some kind of independent, inherent power of the president. Is there anything in the FISA statute that makes you believe that the president has the ability under some other inherent power to disregard the FISA statute?\nHOLDER: No, I do not see that in the FISA statute.\nFEINGOLD: Well, thank you. I think that's a very important break in favor of the rule of law that we've been waiting for in this country for many years. And I appreciate that answer.\nAs I'm sure you know, Congress will consider legislation this year to reauthorize the expiring provision of the USA Patriot Act. You were talking with Senator Kyl about that. Unfortunately, the last time Congress considered reauthorizing the Patriot Act, the administration used scare tactics and over-the-top rhetoric to discount the legitimate concerns raised by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\nAnd I have to say the administration seemed for interested in scoring political points than trying to sit down and find some common ground in some of these provisions where we all want to stop those who intend to harm us but not affect the rights of completely innocent Americans.\nI hope to work with you in a productive way on legitimate concerns that I and others in the Senate have about the extent of government surveillance powers. In fact, I believe you joined a bipartisan letter in the summer of 2005 proposing a number of changes to the Patriot Act.\nI appreciate what you said in response to Senator Kyl about needing to hear from professionals who use these authorities. It's important to hear from experts and advocates concerned about these authorities and how they affect the privacy and civil liberties of innocent Americans.\nSo in light of that, will you commit to working with us on these issues to keeping the lines of communication open at all at another times and to try to resolve any differences as partners who have the same ultimate goal -- the protect the American people and the constitutional rights of our citizens?\nHOLDER: Absolutely, Senator. I will be here as often as I can either in formal settings or informal ones to talk about the needs that I identified that we have in law enforcement in fighting terrorism.\nI think we're going to need law enforcement tools. We need to always look at them to make sure that they are consistent with the obligations that we have, the new challenges that we face. But we always have to be mindful of the fact that there is a civil liberties component to this. And we have to make sure that we understand, as I've said in many speeches, that there's not a tension between respecting our great tradition of civil liberties and having very effective law enforcement and anti-terror tools. There's a false choice, I think, that is often presented. So I would look forward to working with you and the other members of the committee in trying to make sure that we have good, effective laws that are consistent with our values.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you for that answer.\nAs you know, there was much about last year's FISA amendment act with which I strongly disagreed and it included, of course, the granting of immunity to telecommunication companies that allegedly cooperated with the president's warrantless wiretapping program and the inclusion of new surveillance powers without adequate protection for the rights and privacies of innocent Americans.\nBut one positive provision was a requirement that the Department of Justice inspector general, in cooperation with other relevant inspectors general undertake a comprehensive review of the warrantless wiretap program.\nAnd I'm told the IG's report is due to be completed by July of this year. This report could offer the most complete assessment to date of how the program came about and operated for over five years. Will you pledge the full cooperation of the Department of Justice for this effort? And will you pledge to support making as much of the report public as possible so that the American people can finally learn of the full story of this illegal program?\nHOLDER: Absolutely. I think the report that will be done by the inspectors general and led by a fine inspector general at the Department of Justice will be an important tool, an important assessment tool for us to find out how these statutes have been working, how these provisions have been working.\nI know that Glenn Fine and the people working with him will not be shy in expressing any concerns that they have. But they'll also not be shy to tell us how these tools have been effective. I think that that is going to be a good starting point for a conversation that I think we need to have about where we stand with regard to the state of the law and give us a good sense of are we in a good place, are there things that we need to change.\nSo I look forward to that report. And I will do all that I can to ensure that as much of that is made public as is possible.\nFEINGOLD: Thanks. Your testimony recognized the importance of restoring the credibility of the Department of Justice after the terrible issues involving the stewardship of Mr. Gonzales. And you correctly note that despite the steps taken in the right direction by Attorney General Mukasey, there's more work to be done.\nCertainly, the release this week of the OPR IG report on politicized hiring and other personnel actions at the civil rights division only underscores that point.\nAs with so many of the mistakes and abuses of the last administration, I don't think it's just enough to end the misconduct. The lingering effects of that misconduct must also be addressed. So whether it's politicized hiring in the civil rights division or immigration judges or allegations of politically motivated prosecutions as in the Siegelman (ph) case, and there may still be many more.\nWhat will you do to make sure that justice is truly served and that those who engage in wrongdoing don't, in effect, have the last laugh? And in addition, will you cooperate in any further oversight of these matters by the Congress especially with respect to documents that have, until now, been withheld?\nHOLDER: Well, one of the things I'm going to be to do, I think so, as attorney general in short order is to make -- basically do a damage assessment and understand in a way that I do not now how has the institution been harmed by the activities that were uncovered by these inspector general reports.\nWhat has been the lasting impact? There's certainly been damage to the department's reputation. I'd want to know if, as a result of those actions, has there been any structural damage to the department.\nI will work to see -- make that assessment. I will be more than glad to come back to this committee and share with you what I have found and, perhaps, with some suggestions that I might work out with you all, how we might prevent those kinds of things from happening in the future.\nI look forward to working with you in that regard.\nFEINGOLD: What about the documents?\nHOLDER: To the extent that there are documents that will help this committee in that assessment and to the extent that there is not a reason why we should be holding on to them, I will make them available, all with the presumption that, you know, transparency is the best thing and making available documents makes the most sense.\nThere are institutional concerns that we have that I think should be respected. But I also respect the oversight obligations that this come has. And to the extent that I can make documents available in this context or in others, I will do that.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Holder.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you. Thank you very much, Senator.\nSenator Sessions is here. Of course, Senator Sessions is also a former U.S. attorney. He knows (inaudible) and we've relied on him for that experience.\nSenator Sessions, it's over to you.\nSESSIONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And congratulations, Mr. Holder on the nomination. You certainly bring excellent background and experience to the job as a federal prosecutor for a number of years and as a federal judge.\nI think you come to the office with far more experience than Attorney General Gonzales had. I thought he was a good man, but when you lack experience, sometimes, you can make errors unintentionally. I think Former Attorney General Janet Reno was a state prosecutor, but was really inexperienced in a lot of the big issues that come before an attorney general.\nSo you do have the background. You have a great family. It's good to see your wife, a fine physician and an Alabamian and the sister of one of the leading -- one of the leading persons in changing the racial situation in the south as she led the fight to alter the segregated higher education policies that were so often conducted in the south. And those were unacceptable, and she did a very important, historic role -- played a big historic role in that and is so recognized today.\nSo I know you're committed to justice and fairness and equal rights. I just want to ask a few things that we've -- you've had a lot of questions so far about national security. You made your opening statement. You said I will use every available tactic to defeat our adversaries. That's basically what President Bush said. I'm charged with defending this republic; I'm going to use whatever power I can.\nAnd then you go on to say and I will do so within the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. Well, first of all, fundamentally, isn't it the controlling authority -- the constitutional requirements first? Would you agree with what the Constitution actually requires is the fundamental requirement of public service?\nHOLDER: I'm sorry? The Constitution requires?\nSESSIONS: What the Constitution requires is what you're committed to do. Is that not correct?\nHOLDER: That is correct.\nSESSIONS: Now, the only thing that worries me about the spirit of the Constitution is that the spirit tends to be in the eye of the beholder. And what you might think is spirit of the Constitution, somebody else might not.\nAnd I guess I'm worrying about these intelligence offices and military offices and people in the Department of Defense who attempted to protect and defend this country in a time of great concern after the 9/11 attacks and if you formed a prosecution policy, you would want it to be based on plain law of the Constitution and not what somebody might think is within the spirit of the Constitution, would you not?\nHOLDER: Well, Senator, as you know, having been a prosecutor and a great U.S. attorney yourself, there are a whole variety of things that have to go into making a prosecutive determination: What was that person's intent? Did that person act under the thought that he or she had authorization from a higher authority? These are all the kinds of things that would have to be weighed in trying to make a determination whether somebody had acted appropriately, inappropriately, lawfully, or unlawfully. Those are the kinds of things, I think, that have to be weighed.\nSESSIONS: I certainly agree with that. I do just note that you in your June 2008 speech to the American Constitution Society you note, you say that actions after 9/11 were excessive and unlawful. Is that your prosecutorial decision, or is that your impression based on what you may have felt at the time?\nHOLDER: I think that's a fair way of putting it. I think it's an impression. Again, I've not, at that point -- and I'm not now -- read into all of the programs that I was taking the administration to task there about. I was focusing on the surveillance program.\nThere may be components to that that I don't understand, am not familiar with. I've had a chance to look at everything's that been written -- not everything, but a lot -- that has been written about it, have looked at the, I guess, the white paper that the administration put out justifying its view of how it could use the FISA statute.\nSESSIONS: I thank you for just saying that. It makes me feel somewhat better.\nI've been in probably 30 hearings in Armed Services and in Judiciary on these matters. They're very complex. The law changed as time went by. Supreme Court cases came and clarified uncertainties, sometimes overruling what had been previously approved to be legal.\nAnd so I think that is important. It makes me feel a little better about your next statement in that speech where you said we owe the American people a reckoning. You're not threatening and not guaranteeing you're going to prosecute people until you fairly evaluate all of the facts and the evidence and the law they thought they were dealing with at the time?\nHOLDER: No, senator.\nAnd, actually, when I used that term, that's gotten a lot more attention than I think it deserves. I really was only talking about sharing information with the American people to the extent that we could about what was done in their name. I wasn't really thinking about prosecutions at all in that regard. I was thinking about information sharing.\nSESSIONS: Well, you know, Jack Goldsmith, the man who wrote the book The Terror Presidency, he was a brilliant lawyer in the Department of Justice. He felt that some of the things that the Bush administration did were in error. And he's been critical and cited as a critic of the administration.\nBut he made these comments: One consequence of the OLC's authority -- that's the Office of Legal Counsel, and that's an office within the Department of Justice, as you know, that is given authority to express opinions -- he said one consequence of their authority to interpret the law is the power to bestow on government officials what is effectively an advance pardon for actions taken at the edges of vague criminal laws.\nIn other words, if something is vague, and the attorney general, Office of Legal Counsel, says it's OK, then isn't an official in the intelligence agencies and the military or the Federal Investigative Service entitled to rely on that until it's reversed?\nHOLDER: Well, one of the things that you'd have to take into account in making a prosecutive decision, or just making a determination as to whether somebody had acted appropriately, would be to see under what authority they were acting. An OLC opinion that gave a person the ability to do something and was reasonably relied on, was appropriate -- and the opinion was appropriately and in good faith drafted -- would be something that would obviously have to be taken into account in deciding whether somebody acted appropriately or not. That would be a huge factor.\nSESSIONS: I think that's true. And sometimes those opinions could've been in error. As attorney general of Alabama, I used to have to issue those opinions. And it did protect the offices of the state until some lawful court reversed it.\nAnd I just think we need to remember that as these officers are out there trying to serve their country. Attorney General Mukasey says you rely -- he said if you don't follow that principle, it would tell people you rely on a Justice Department opinion as part of a program, then you will be subject to criminal investigation when and as and if the tenure of the person who wrote the position changed or the political winds changed. In other words, a person's got -- the average guy out there serving his country has got to be comfortable that he can rely on the opinions of the Department of Justice.\nYou know, I'm glad you say that.\nWith regard to the FALN clemency situation, we had a hearing on it in the Senate, and it was pretty contentious. The United States Senate passed a resolution that was 95-2 -- I think that most every member of this committee supported it -- that deplored that pardon and included \"whereas the release of terrorists is an affront to the rule of law, the victims and their families, and every American who believes that violent acts must be punished to the fullest extent of the law,\" then it deplored those activities. We discussed that at some length, and my time is winding down now. Maybe we'll be able to talk about it a little later.\nHOLDER: Sure.\nSESSIONS: But fundamentally let me say this: I thought it was an inexplicable pardon. I believe that it reversed the recommendation of Margaret Love, a very fine pardon attorney who I believe you removed, and imposed and allowed this to go forward in a way that I think is unjustifiable -- I just think is unjustifiable. And you indicated you learned from that process.\nLet me ask you fundamentally now...\n(CROSSTALK)\nLEAHY: A vote is started.\nSESSIONS: OK.\nLEAHY: And the time is up. Do you want to make a short...\nSESSIONS: I've got...\nLEAHY: Because we're going to have to...\nSESSIONS: Oh, I'm over. I thought I had 20 seconds.\nLEAHY: We are going to have a second...\nSESSIONS: I'm over 20 seconds...\nLEAHY: We are going to have a second round of...\nSESSIONS: I'll just ask this simple question: You've indicated you made a mistake. Do you believe that the decision and the ultimate act of President Clinton to pardon these individuals was wrong?\nHOLDER: I think it's a difficult decision that the president had. I think that there were a lot of people who were in support of that clemency request: Nobel Peace Prize laureates, Coretta Scott King, President Carter, Desmond Tutu, Cardinal O'Connor in New York. When one looks at the nature of the offenses that put those people in jail, these were criminals. These were terrorists. These were bad people. But the president's determination was that they had not committed any acts themselves that resulted in death or bodily injury.\nAnd on that basis, and given the amount of time that they had served in jail -- roughly 16-19 years, most I think 19 years -- and given the length of the sentences that they had received, it was his determination that the clemency requests were appropriate, taking all that into consideration.\nSESSIONS: But do you personally now -- I know the president has justified it...\nLEAHY: Senator...\nSESSIONS: Do you personally have an opinion after all of this whether it was right or wrong?\nHOLDER: I think that given all that I have described that what the president did was reasonable.\nLEAHY: Senator Schumer, you're also, like all of us, are juggling three different committees. I'm going to recognize you. I'd ask -- the vote started, several of us would be leaving, myself included -- at the end of your round of questioning, would you -- we will then stand in recess until 2:15 at the end of Senator Schumer's questions.\nAnd, Senator Sessions, I guarantee you will have another round.\nSESSIONS: Thank you.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, Mr. Nominee. And I appreciate -- I'll try to stick with my 10 minutes and get over to the vote.\nAnd I want to thank you for your years of service. I worked with you when you were deputy attorney general. I was impressed then as I am now with your integrity, your experience, your excellence.\nMuch of the discussion leading up to your hearing has focused on the question of your independence: Will you be the people's lawyer or the president's lawyer? And I think this is absolutely and correctly at the heart of the matter, because every other day, it seems, another scathing report from the inspector general hits us on the head like a hammer reminding us that the likes of Alberto Gonzales and Bradley Schlossman sullied and demoralized a great legal institution -- probably the finest civil service institution in the country -- that they really dragged through the mud.\nSo we're in dire need of a less political and more independent Justice Department beginning at the very top. And I spent a lot of time in the last Congress, as you know, making this point. Four years ago, moreover, the question of independence was my central consideration when Alberto Gonzales sat in the witness chair: that he was too close to the president, didn't understand the nature of the job of attorney general.\nAs I said when I voted against him at the time, \"It's hard to be straight shooter when you're a blind loyalist.\" And I think that in my entire Senate career, the vote against Alberto Gonzales may have been one of the most vindicated by subsequent history.\nSo some of my friends across the aisle are questioning your independence and making ludicrous comparisons to Mr. Gonzales. And they're cherry picking a few episodes from your long and distinguished career and ignoring, conveniently, other more substantial actions you've taken that manifest a true independent streak in the best traditions of the Justice Department.\nMy colleagues have mentioned them already. I'm not a fan of either the Marc Rich pardon or the FALN. I disagree with your ultimate analysis on FALN -- and on Marc Rich, I guess, although you certainly said that was a mistake. I was a critic then, and I'm a critic now.\nThe essential point, though, is that many who have criticized your role in those pardons -- Democrat and Republican alike -- recognize your entire career and vigorously support your nomination: Jim Comey, Louis Freeh, the Fraternal Order of Police.\nSo if we're going to make an informed assessment about your independence, I think we have to look at the entire record. And as I look at your background and record, it's clear that you are less connected and less beholden to the new president than most attorneys general in the last 50 years.\nLet's review for a moment. I have a few quick questions for you.\nHave you ever been President-elect Obama's personal lawyer, like William French Smith had been for years for Ronald Reagan?\nHOLDER: No, I have not.\nSCHUMER: Have you ever been a staffer to Barack Obama, like Ed Meese had been for President Reagan?\nHOLDER: No, I have not, senator.\nSCHUMER: Have you ever served as official counsel to Barack Obama, like Alberto Gonzales had been for George Bush?\nHOLDER: No, I have not, senator.\nSCHUMER: And, by the way, has Barack Obama ever dispatched you to the hospital room of a sick government official...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... to get him to authorize an illegal wiretap program?\nHOLDER: (Inaudible)\nSCHUMER: Yeah, I didn't think so.\nHOLDER: No, he has not.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSCHUMER: All right.\nAnd I take it you're not a close relation to the new president, like Bobby Kennedy was to Jack Kennedy?\nHOLDER: No, we're not related by blood, though people do say we look alike.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSCHUMER: I don't think so.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAlthough you're both very handsome.\nHOLDER: I've heard he's handsome. I was going to try to, you know, draft on that.\nSCHUMER: OK.\nLet me ask you this: Have you ever been a professional politician, like, say, John Ashcroft or Dick Thornburg?\nHOLDER: No, I've never run for office.\nSCHUMER: OK.\nBefore last year, at age 57 after 30 years as a lawyer, did you owe any paid job or government appointment to Barack Obama?\nHOLDER: No, I have not. I do not.\nSCHUMER: When did you first meet the president-elect?\nHOLDER: After he was elected but before he was sworn in as a senator.\nSCHUMER: Great.\nWhat did the president-elect tell you about what kind of attorney general he wanted you to be?\nHOLDER: He said, Eric, you've got to understand you've got to be different. You know, we have a pretty good relationship. That's probably going to change as a result of your taking this position. I don't want you to do anything that you don't feel comfortable doing. You've got to be my counselor. You've got to tell if I'm going to get myself in any kind of trouble. I understand that the Justice Department is different. I understand that you're going to be different.\nHe said he hoped that it wouldn't affect our relationship, but he says he understands that I have a different obligation than other people in the Cabinet.\nSCHUMER: OK. Well, that's refreshing, because I doubt that President Bush ever had that kind of conversation with Alberto Gonzales. And it's a refreshing change.\nSo when we talk about independence, we need to keep in mind the notion of independence is often a two-way street.\nI welcome your nomination, not just because you will be a different kind of attorney general but because Barack Obama will be a different kind of president.\nSo I really want to thank you. I believe that your nomination, should you be approved, will end the rancid politization at the department, because it will mean an end to waterboarding and other shameful forms of torture and because it will mean a full return to the rule of law and our reputation around the world.\nSCHUMER: I believe you, unlike some of your predecessors, will be the chief law enforcement officer of the land above all. So I want to look forward, not backward. We should be focus is on how you will lead the department and how you'll change it. And so in that vein, I have some questions for you.\nNow, Senator Leahy touched on this, but I want to elaborate because I had questioned quite pointedly and carefully Mr. Schlossman. I thought then that he wasn't telling the truth. And, of course, the IG's report said he made false states to Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, and several to me.\nSo last week -- and I am not satisfied that the referral to the U.S. attorney was just, you know, they said they're not going to prosecute without any explanation whatsoever. I wrote General Mukasey asking them that the matter of Schlossman be additionally referred to Nora Dannahey. She's the acting U.S. attorney for Connecticut. She's been made special prosecutor already to look too possibility of -- possibly criminal activity in the department's hiring and firing.\nDo you see any problem with making such a referral should you be selected as -- or approved as attorney general?\nHOLDER: Well, I'd say that I have great respect for the lawyers who work in the U.S. attorney's office in D.C. at the office that I had the great privilege of leading. There are good lawyers there. And the fact that it is -- if it's accurately reported that they had a chance to fully look at that matter and they declined prosecution, that would be significant for me.\nOn the other hand, I'm very disturbed by what I read or have read about that is contained in the report where the inspector general essentially makes a finding that false testimony was given before this committee.\nAnd as I indicated to Senator Feinstein, I would like to -- myself -- review the determination that was made by the U.S. attorney's office.\nSCHUMER: At the very minimum, without disclosing any confidential grand jury or other information, could we at least get a report on why the U.S. attorney in D.C. refused to prosecute? Was it that, you know, was it that he disputed the lying to Congress terminology of the IG? Was it that he didn't think he could prove the case? Perjury cases and false statement cases are difficult?\nWould you at least be willing to commit to us to do that?\nHOLDER: I will to the extent that I can share that information. I mean, grand jury secrecy frequently prevents a prosecutor from sharing all of the reasons why he or she has made a particular determination.\nBut to the extent that we can, I will do that.\nSCHUMER: Good. Because I'm not asking for specific details of who said what before the grand jury but just why the ultimate conclusion was made. And if you disagree with it, I presume you would refer to -- you'd look somewhere, and Ms. Dannahey's office is the right place to go.\nJust one more on the Civil Rights Division. Again, a crown jewel of this Justice Department, the report from the IG revealed in many ways it was more like a campaign headquarters than a hall of justice. The report luridly detailed the remarkable extent to which the Civil Rights Division -- what a great tradition in that body -- through Democrat and Republican presidents alike, under George Bush the first, they took the voting rights act to a greater extent than anybody else.\nAnd then from 2003 to 2006, one single appointee, political appointee, Schlossman, hired 63 lawyers, 20 percent of the lawyers working at OCR, on the basis of their conservative political leanings. It's a blatant violation. It would be a blatant violation if some did -- if a Democrat did the same thing on the liberal side.\nAnd one supervisor saying to another that he took his coffee Mary Francis Berry style -- black and bitter type of overtly racist statement all the more shocking when it's a supervisor at the Civil Rights Division who says this.\nWhat are you going to do to make sure that this doesn't happen again? What are you going to do to sort of clean up and straighten out the Civil Rights Division with its great tradition?\nHOLDER: Let me be very clear. The attempt to politicize the department will not be tolerated should I become attorney general of the United States. It will be my intention to return that division and the Department of Justice as a whole to its great traditions and the great traditions that it had under Democratic and Republican attorneys general and presidents.\nWhat we have seen revealed in these inspector general reports is almost unbelievable to me. It is clearly abhorrent. And it's inconsistent with the way in which I would run the Department of Justice.\nSCHUMER: We expect a thorough cleaning up of the Civil Rights Division. Setting it back on its civil service course, if you will.\nHOLDER: It is my intention to devote a huge amount of time looking at the Civil Rights Division and restoring that division, making sure that there's a sense of mission, there's a focus on the things that have made that one of -- as I think you appropriately call it -- one of the jewels in the Justice Department.\nI see somebody sitting behind you, Billy Omens (ph), who served in the civil right division very proudly. He the kind of person who we need in the division. He's the kind of person who should be supervising people. He's the kind of person who should be teaching the young lawyers in the Civil Rights Division. That is what is my intention; to bring the Civil Rights Division back to the kind that existed when Billy Omens (ph) was there.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Holder. And I am quite certain from your record, the basis of your testimony today you'll be confirmed and will be a really fine attorney general.\nSCHUMER: We are adjourned till 2:15.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: It is amazing what a busy day this is in the Senate. Senators have been in and out. There have been numerous confirmation hearings going on.\nThere have been farewell speeches on the Senate floor, one by a man I have sat with on this committee for over 30 years, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, who is leaving to become vice president. The other, a senator, my neighbor from the State of New York, Senator Hillary Clinton. And so, a number of senators have left to be there for their farewell.\nI have apologized to each one of them. We've been -- that, obviously, I've been here, as have other people chairing such hearings.\nThey are now in the process of swearing in a new senator from Illinois, who is no longer Senator-designee Burris, but now Senator Burris.\nSo, I'm going to go next, speaking of elected or appointed, the newly re-elected, the newly re-elected and senior senator from South Carolina, Senator Graham. I mention the senior senator, because one of his predecessors, whom I also served, Senator Hollings, served as junior senator from South Carolina for how many years, Lindsey? About 30?\nGRAHAM: Thirty-six.\nLEAHY: Thirty-six years. The most senior junior senator ever. That's because Strom Thurmond, who came here with the 1st Congress -- the Continental Congress...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... was the senior senator.\nBut Lindsey Graham is the senior senator from South Carolina. He's recently been in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq with Senator Biden. We're glad to have you back.\nGo ahead.\nGRAHAM: Thank you. I enjoyed my trip with the vice president- elect, and I did a lot of listening. It was fun.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: That apparently is not -- that apparently is not the totally inside joke as you might have thought it was.\n(LAUGHTER)\nGRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I can assure you, I'm genetically term-limited. So, I do have a tough act to follow in Thurmond and Hollings.\nBut the one thing I would like to say to our nominee, I cannot think of a more personal decision one can make than hiring a lawyer. And you'll be the nation's lawyer, the attorney general.\nBut my perspective on these matters is that the president of the United States deserves the ability, within reason, to pick a lawyer in the attorney general that he or she has great confidence in. And the fact that this president has chosen you speaks well for you. And given your resume, even though we have probably a lot of political differences, I could understand why he has great confidence in you.\nHaving said that, as we move forward, one of the big issues facing this nation, and the legal community within our nation, is what to do with detainees that are captured in what is called the war on terror?\nIt's complicated. It's emotional. But I think it's very important that we get it right.\nAnd, Mr. Holder, is it fair to say that we're at war, in your opinion?\nHOLDER: I don't think there's any question but that we are at war. And I think, to be honest, I think our nation didn't realize that we were at war when, in fact, we were.\nWhen I look back at the '90s and the Tanzanian -- the embassy bombings, the bombing of the Cole, I think we as a nation should have realized that, at that point, we were at war. We should not have waited until September the 11th of 2001, to make that determination.\nGRAHAM: I'm almost ready to vote for you right now.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI'll stop.\nI agree with you. We're at war. And the enemy that we're at war with, would you agree, is an unconventional enemy?\nHOLDER: No question about that. There is not going to be a surrender signing on the battleship Missouri. This war is not going to end in that way.\nGRAHAM: And the people who are fighting, they don't wear uniforms.\nHOLDER: They do not, which...\nGRAHAM: They operate outside the law of armed conflict.\nHOLDER: They do.\nGRAHAM: Maybe some of the most vicious people our nation has ever fought in our history.\nHOLDER: I would agree with that.\nGRAHAM: If you were trying to explain to a civics class in the ninth grade the battlefield, where is the battlefield in this war? What makes up the battlefield?\nHOLDER: That's a very interesting question, senator.\nThe battlefield -- there are physical battlefields, certainly, in Afghanistan. But there are battlefields, potentially, you know, in our nation. There are cyber battlefields that we're going to have to -- where we're going to have to engage.\nBut there's also -- and this sounds a little trite, but I think it's real -- there's a battlefield, if you want to call it that, with regard to the hearts and minds of the people in the Islamic world.\nWe have to do things in a way, conduct ourselves in a way that we win that battle, as well, so that people there who might otherwise be well intentioned, do not end up on the wrong side and against us.\nGRAHAM: The way I put it, there's a higher ground in every war. And there's physical higher ground, and in this case, there's the moral high ground, which I think is essential to win this war, is for America to maintain the moral higher ground. Do you agree with that?\nHOLDER: Yes, I do.\nGRAHAM: Now, when you talk about the physical battlefield, if our intelligence agencies should capture someone in the Philippines that is suspected of financing Al Qaida worldwide, would you consider that person part of the battlefield, even though we're in the Philippines, if they were involved in an Al Qaida activity?\nHOLDER: Yes, I would.\nGRAHAM: OK.\nNow, as we decide what form to try people and how to interrogate them, and how to detain them, the only thing I ask of this new administration is that we not criminalize the war. I'm not asking for the ability to be inhumane.\nMatter of fact, I am crying out for our country to realize that, if we capture somebody in this war on terror, and no matter how vicious the enemy may be, it becomes about us, not them. Once they're in our capture, it's not about who they are or what they believe. It's about our values.\nSo, as we close Guantanamo Bay, I would just urge you to sit down with military lawyers, people in both parties and great legal minds, and let's think through this process of how we can be at war with this enemy and protect ourselves, and maintain the moral high ground that will be essential.\nAnd the hard case for me -- and, I think, for the country at large -- is that person that is captured in this war on terror, because of the sensitive nature of the information, may not be subject to the normal criminal process, whether it be a military trial or an Article 3 trial. But we know, based on competent evidence, that they will go back to the fight.\nHave you thought much about what to do with that group?\nHOLDER: Struggled with that, and continue to struggle with that. These are extremely difficult questions, the ones that you have posed.\nAnd it's one of the reasons why in my opening remarks I said it, and I meant it sincerely, that all of the knowledge and all of the good ideas does not reside in the executive branch.\nYou're a person who has spent a lot of time thinking about these issues. We had a very interesting conversation when I came to visit you, and had, I thought, some very, very interesting perspectives and some good thoughts. This committee has been engaged in thinking about the very questions that you raise.\nWe are going to have to come up with American solutions. These are truly not Republican and Democratic issues. I mean, we as a nation -- and this committee in particular -- I think has to come up with a way in which we resolve those issues.\nAnd the one that you have raised is one that has given me a great deal -- I've given a great deal of thought to. How do we deal in an appropriate way with somebody who we know is a danger to this country, and yet be true to our values, and, in that battle for the hearts and minds that I discussed, make it appear that we're treating this person sworn to harm us, treat that person in a fair way, in a way that frankly they would not treat us?\nGRAHAM: Absolutely.\nHOLDER: And how we resolve that issue, that particular issue, I think will say more about us as a nation than almost anything.\nGRAHAM: Well, let me put on the record sort of a goal I think we all share, that if we hold someone in prison, in a military prison, it will not be because somebody in the executive branch said so. It has to be as a result of a process that would allow independent checks and balances.\nI really believe that the federal courts have a tremendous responsibility and role in answering the questions before -- that we're talking about now. So, my goal would be, is that, if we hold somebody off the battlefield that we think is part of the enemy force, not subject to normal criminal trials, that it will be done with a process that people have confidence in, that the person will be held only after an independent judiciary agrees that the evidence is competent, and that the executive branch collaborates with the Congress and other respected institutions in making that decision.\nI think that's sort of been lacking. If we can find that common ground, I think the country will be better off.\nAnd when it comes to the trial of people suspected of committing a war crime, I hope you will look long and hard at our military justice system. I've been part of it for 25 years. And I think you've seen at Guantanamo Bay, some of the sentences show that the jurors, the panel members are very reflective. And they evaluate the evidence, and they take their duty very responsibly.\nI'd end on this note. Our allies are struggling with this problem. Every other nation deals with this through the criminal, the domestic criminal lens.\nAnd as I understand it, there is no concept in domestic criminal law that would allow you to hold someone indefinitely without trial.\nDo you agree with that?\nHOLDER: I think that's right.\nGRAHAM: And let me tell anyone who's listening, there should not be. No one should be held in a domestic criminal environment indefinitely without the right to a trial.\nBut I do believe that every person who commits to going to war against America, or any other peaceful nation, should be held off the battlefield as long as they're dangerous.\nDo you agree with that?\nHOLDER: I do.\nGRAHAM: There is a difference between a warrior and a criminal. And if you want to know that difference, go read the transcript of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as he testifies before the combat status review tribunal. There is no doubt in my mind that he is at war with us and that if he ever was released he would go back to the fight. So there's a difference between a common criminal and a committed warrior.\nThe military justice system is humane, is transparent, I think is the right forum. And I look forward to working with you as we answer these hard questions.\nSo, God bless. Thank you for your willingness to serve your country in this capacity.\nHOLDER: Thank you, senator.\nLEAHY: I might say, just for a moment, Mr. Holder, Senator Graham has discussed these issues with me. Sometimes we've been on long trips, sometimes just privately. I've relied on his own experience in the Judge Advocate General's Corps.\nWe've also had a number of military, as Senator Graham knows, come before us and testify, sometimes risking their own careers to say what they feel should be done. We sat there with two- and three-star generals testifying that way. And they and Senator Graham and others have been most instructive to the members of this committee who have not been in the military of how the uniformed court of military justice works.\nAnd I would suggest, should you be confirmed as I fully expect you to be, that you may want to spend -- and we'll obviously have hearings on this subject -- but you may want to spend some time in informal discussions with people like Senator Graham, myself and others, both Republicans and Democrats on this committee, maybe in an informal setting, who will at least let you know what our views are and have the kind of candid, off-the-record discussion that one should, because this is a major issue facing our country.\nHOLDER: Yes. I think that's actually a very good idea. And I referenced, if you want to talk about the substance, the conversation that I had with Senator Graham. I spent probably half an hour, 45 minutes, with him. And I left there thinking that this is a gentleman who has thought about these issues an awful lot. I think what you say about our military system of justice is correct, not only in the sentences that have been handed down but also the evidentiary rulings the judges have made there, things that I think a lot of people did not necessarily expect to see in that system.\nAnd I think that what you're saying, Mr. Chairman, makes an awful lot of sense. There is a -- as I said, you all have grappled with these issues a lot longer than I have, quite frankly. And it would be foolish not to tap into the wisdom that resides in this committee.\nLEAHY: And if there is no objection, I want to put into the record a letter of support from 10 retired generals and admirals -- this is 10 retired generals and admirals that support you, Mr. Holder. They're experts in military issues including military detention, interrogation.\nThey have reflected the conscience of the nation in this area. And they say in their letters, to summarize them, that they feel you will keep America safe while protecting our basic constitutional rights. And I think that should be considered.\nNow, when I first came on this committee, I served with Senator Mathias of Maryland, a man who showed great conscience. And I served for years with Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, a person I know and know well, also traveled with. And his successor is now here, Senator Cardin, who carries on the tradition of thoughtful senators from Maryland.\nAnd Senator Cardin, thank you for being here. The floor is yours.\nCARDIN: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had great mentors in Senator Mathias and Senator Sarbanes.\nMr. Holder, thank you. Thank you for being willing to serve your country. And I want to thank your family, because we know the sacrifices that they have to make in the long hours that you are going to need to put in as the attorney general of the United States.\nI want to talk a little bit about the Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division has such an important function in our country. They're responsible for the enforcement of the federal statutes against discrimination, the Civil Rights Acts, the Voting Rights Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, National Voter Registration Act, and Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, and the list goes on and on. It's a critically important division in the Department of Justice and for the people of this country.\nThe record over the last eight years has been alarming. There have been so few important cases brought by the Civil Rights Division over the eight years in, you know, in just about every category. They have resisted being proactive in protecting the civil liberties and civil rights of the people of this country. When you look at the allocation of resources that's been given to the Civil Rights Division, it's been reduced. We've already had several senators comment about Bradley Schlossman's activities and his partisan politics in the personnel decisions made in the Civil Rights Division -- illegal activities, I might add.\nI want to give you an opportunity to tell me your own personal commitment to the Civil Rights Division if you are confirmed to be attorney general and how you will direct that division head as far as the historic role of the Civil Rights Division and what you expect to see during the Obama administration.\nHOLDER: Senator, I agree with you. The Civil Rights Division is unique. It is in some ways the conscience of the Justice Department. And I think in some ways you can measure the success of an attorney general's tenure by how the Civil Rights Division has done.\nThe Civil Rights Division has not necessarily gotten the attention, the resources, the support that it has needed and requires over the last few years.\nShould I become attorney general, that would be my intention: to give it the resources that I have and the attention that the division needs and to revitalize a place that has really tons and tons of great lawyers and paralegals and support staff, people who are dedicated to the mission of that division -- people who work hard and stay there, you know, extraordinarily long periods of time through the course of their careers when they could go and do other things and get paid far greater amounts of money. They're committed to the mission of the division. And that, I think, has got to be one of the things I really focus on should I become attorney general.\nOne of the things we're going to have to do as an initial matter is to get a great assistant attorney general, a person who is steeped in civil rights law, a person who is respected, and a person who will understand that the job he or she is going to be given is going to be a tough one, and will be committed to revitalizing that great division.\nI think we can do it. I think we'll also need the help of the members of this committee in terms of resources, oversight -- there's a whole variety of ways in which I think you could help us. But that will be a priority for me.\nCARDIN: I appreciate that.\nI want to just mention one example. In voting rights cases, the record over the Bush administration: They've brought zero cases on behalf of African Americans for voting rights between the years of 2001 and 2006. Yet they were there to defend the Georgia draconian voter ID law that's been called the modern-day poll tax.\nIn my campaign for the United States Senate in the 2006 elections, there were deceptive practices that took place in Maryland and in other states around the nation that were aimed directly at reducing minority participation in the elections. We asked the Justice Department to take a look at those practices. Senator Schumer sent the letter in asking for action. Senator Obama, then Senator Obama, filed legislation to strengthen deceptive practices laws to give the Justice Department additional tools, if they need those additional tools, to make it clear that we won't tolerate those who are using campaign tactics to suppress minority participation.\nI would like you to review the laws that you have, the tools that you have today, and come back to us and let us know whether you have adequate tools available to you so that the federal government can be actively involved to make sure that those types of practices that took place in my state and many other states around the nation -- such things as sending out letters in minority communities telling them the election day was the wrong day to try to keep them from voting -- that you have the tools to make sure that the full weight of the attorney general, the Department of Justice, can be used to prevent those types of activities.\nHOLDER: Senator, I appreciate that offer. And should I be confirmed I will take you up on it.\nThe needs are great in that division. I hope the expectations are high, and I hope that we will meet those expectations.\nThis is a president-elect who is committed to the very things that you are talking about. This is an attorney general, or a person who could be the attorney general, who shares the concerns that you have.\nCARDIN: Well, again, I thank you for that.\nI'll mention one other area that I think shows a disparity, a racial disparity in our country. We've had a lot of discussion about the crack cocaine issue. And when you take a look at the statistics, African Americans now serve virtually as much time in prison for drug offenses as whites do for violent crimes.\nThirty-seven percent of the people arrested for drug violations, 59 percent of the convictions, and 74 percent of those sentenced to drug offenses are African American, even though they represent only 15 percent of the population.\nMy point is this: We know we have disparities in our laws. We know we have disparities in the way prosecution is centered, and it's very clear that's true in regards to crack cocaine. We need a strategy to make sure that we rid ourselves of those types of practices in this country.\nI don't want to be soft on those who are violating our criminal statutes. I want to make sure that we are tough. Drugs are a huge menace to our society, and I want to do everything I can to make sure we have effective laws. But let's make sure it is fairly applied in this country.\nAnd I would like to have your commitment that you will work with us and come up with a strategy where we can have, I think, a fairer system of justice and a tough system as well.\nHOLDER: Well, I think that's right.\nWe have to be tough. We have to be smart. And we have to be fair. Our criminal justice system has to be fair. It has to be viewed as being as fair.\nWhen I was a judge here in Washington, D.C., I saw in the people who served on juries here a knowledge, a recognition, that -- at least in their minds -- parts of the criminal justice system were not fair. And you saw it in some of the verdicts that I saw in cases that I presided over.\nAnd when I would speak to jurors afterwards and say, well, you know, \"Why did you vote this way in a case where it seemed to me the government had all the evidence that proved all the elements of the crime?\" And they'd talk about inadequacies in the criminal justice system, disparate penalties, and say that, you know, \"Really, I'm not going to be a part of that.\"\nAnd so I think those are the kinds of attitudes that we have to recognize that are out there and come up with a system, as you say, that is tough, smart and fair.\nCARDIN: I have time for one more question. So let me return to the issue of torture for one moment. And your answers were very strong, and I strongly support what you have said in regards to torture.\nBut I want to call your attention to one other area in which could be a concern, and that is the use of rendition where the United States has custody of individuals and turned them over to other countries where we know that they will in fact use torture as a means of interrogation.\nThe United States has entered into the Convention Against Torture. That convention provides that we should not expel, extradite or otherwise effect the involuntarily removal of any person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\nCould you just tell me pretty clearly that in your points about torture being illegal in this country that it would be wrong for the United States to turn over custody of an individual that we have to a country where we have reason to believe that they will use torture against an individual that we've transmitted custody?\nHOLDER: Let me try to state this as simply as I can: It simply should not be the policy or the practice of the United States of America to turn over a prisoner, a captured person, to a nation where we suspect or have reason to believe that that person will be tortured.\nI've engaged in, as United States attorney, renditions, ordered renditions, but this was to bring people from a foreign country to this country for trial. If we are sending somebody to a place where -- England, Canada, I don't know, some place where we have some basis to believe people will be adequately treated and fairly tried -- we're in a fundamentally different situation than sending somebody to a country where we think they will be mistreated and will not be tried in a fair system. And that should not be the policy or practice of our great nation.\nCARDIN: Again, I thank you for those clear answers. They're the ones that at least I wanted to hear. And I just want to concur (NASDAQ:CNQR) with Senator Graham and his comments in regards to the way that we treat the people that we detain. And I look forward to your confirmation as the next U.S. attorney general.\nHOLDER: Thank you, Senator.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much.\nWe also, we have a former attorney general, former Supreme Court justice, newly reelected senator from Texas, has been my partner on Freedom of Information Act legislation. And because no good deed goes unpunished, his caucus has now elected him to be head of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.\nI'm glad you could have time, however, to be here. And I recognize Senator Cornyn from Texas.\nCORNYN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, good afternoon.\nHOLDER: Good afternoon.\nCORNYN: I mentioned to Mr. Holder -- good afternoon.\nHOLDER: Good afternoon.\nCORNYN: Good to see you. I mentioned in our conversations, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Holder and I, about our commitment to open government issues and Freedom of Information Act reform. And I believe he agreed that open government, more transparency produces greater confidence in their government, and more accountability among public servants.\nAnd I don't want to speak for you, Mr. Holder, but I think you agreed that you would work with us to open up the government, to make it more transparent and more accountable.\nDid I represent that correctly?\nHOLDER: I would hire you as my lawyer. You did, yes, exactly right. That's consistent with our conversation.\nCORNYN: Well, let me -- since Senator Cardin did a good job asking about things like rendition, I just -- it's at the top of my list to think about.\nIf we close Guantanamo Bay -- and a military tribunal or some other tribunal determines that an individual is not guilty of a particular war crime with which they're charged, and they are ordered released -- if we close Guantanamo Bay and put these detainees at Fort Leavenworth, or somebody else, and their home country won't take them back, what do you propose we do with them?\nHOLDER: That is a difficult question. It's one that, I guess, Senator Graham was talking about.\nAt the end of the day, if we have a basis to determine that a person is dangerous, and we have evidence that would demonstrate that that person is dangerous, I don't think that, given the Supreme Court decision in Hamdi, and the responsibility that I have as attorney of the United States, should I be confirmed, for the safety of this nation, that that is a person who we can release.\nNow...\nCORNYN: You're aware that, according to the Department of Defense, about 61 detainees who have been released from Guantanamo Bay have rejoined the fight against the United States and our allies. And that would be the kind of danger that you would want to protect our country from. Is that correct?\nHOLDER: We want to try to minimize that possibility, while at the same time making sure that we are fair in making a determination that somebody is dangerous, and then having periodic reviews to make sure that that person remains dangerous.\nI think if you do that, we are within our rights and within the law to detain that person.\nCORNYN: Let me re-address and, because of the nature of these -- I've been in and out, and forgive me if this is territory you've covered before. It probably is.\nBut as you know, on August 11, 1999, President Clinton extended offers of clemency to 16 terrorists who were committed to gaining Puerto Rico's independence by waging war on the United States. They had not shown remorse for their crime, and they had not even applied for clemency.\nYet the clemency that was granted by President Clinton has been condemned overwhelmingly by both parties in both houses of Congress. And I'm advised -- and please, I'm asking this as a question -- I was advised that this morning, that you called this clemency reasonable.\nCould you explain why you think it's reasonable?\nHOLDER: Yes. I thought -- what I said was, I thought that the president's determination was a reasonable one, given the fact that there was -- that these people had served really extended periods of time in jail. Given the fact that -- the nature of the offenses of which they were convicted, they did not directly harm anyone. They were not responsible directly for any murders.\nBut I think another factor is that we deal with a world now that is different than the one that existed then. That decision was made in a pre-9/11 context.\nI don't know what President Clinton would do now. I tend to think that I would probably view that case in a different way in a post-9/11 world.\nCORNYN: How about in a post-New York Trade Center bombing of 1993, attacks against our embassies in Africa, the bombing of the USS Cole? Would those have been sufficient to raise your concern about granting clemency to acknowledged terrorists, who did not even apply for clemency and who showed no remorse for their crimes?\nHOLDER: I was saying to Senator -- I think it was Senator Graham -- that I think we as a nation didn't come to understand that we were at war soon enough, that we waited, perhaps, until the attacks in New York and Pennsylvania and Washington on September the 11th.\nAnd, you know, hindsight is always 20-20. But I think that, looking at the incidents that you have referenced, those -- again, I can't speak for the president -- but those, I think, might have had an impact on my views.\nCORNYN: Did you recommend clemency for the FALN terrorists to President Clinton?\nHOLDER: Yes.\nCORNYN: Was that a mistake?\nHOLDER: No, I don't think it was a mistake.\nCORNYN: Well, let me rephrase that, in fairness to you. You said, after 9/11, you would have viewed it differently. Post-9/11, if you had it to do over again, would you do the same thing? Or would you have declined to recommend it to the president?\nHOLDER: It's an interesting question. I think that I would have viewed it differently. I think that the recommendation that I might have made would have been different in this way.\nI think I would have said either this is something we shouldn't do, or, to the extent that you want -- or to the extent that there's a desire to do something, and you're asking what my opinion is -- that the sentences should not be commuted to the extent that they were.\nI think that's where I probably would have ended up. I don't think I would have -- I would not have ended up, I think, in the same place that I was when that happened.\nCORNYN: You would agree with me that, I assume that after 9/11, the legal, correct and appropriate way to address this novel attack against the United States, and the fact that we -- I think you agreed with Senator Graham earlier that they should not be treated -- terrorism should not be considered just a mere crime. But that these are -- this whole -- the war against terror raised a number of novel legal issues that, really, we had not had to struggle with since World War II. And even then, it was far different than it was today -- or is today.\nI want to just ask you a hypothetical. Earlier you condemned the use of waterboarding. But you're familiar with the ticking time bomb scenario. And I just want to pose a hypothetical for you.\nLet's say, as attorney general, you find out that there are terrorists who have access to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, and that you have a detainee who is in possession of information that, if disclosed, would prevent those weapons from being detonated in the United States and thousands, maybe tens of thousands of innocent people being killed.\nYou would still refuse to condone aggressive interrogation techniques like waterboarding to get that information, which would, under my hypothetical, save perhaps tens of thousands of lives?\nHOLDER: Well, I think there are a couple of ways in which I'd look at that. One, I would not assume that, because I would say waterboarding should not be done, that that's the only tool, the only mechanism that we would have in our arsenal to try to get that information from that person as quickly as we could.\nI also think I'm not at all certain that waterboarding somebody, torturing somebody, whatever technique you want to use, is necessarily going to produce the results that we want.\nWhat I've heard from the experts is that people will say almost anything to avoid torture. They will give you whatever information they think you want to hear. And so, I'm not at all certain that, given the time sensitivity that I assume you have in your hypothetical, that waterboarding that person would necessarily give us the result that we want.\nAnd I think we also have to understand that we have other things in our arsenal that we could use, other techniques that we could use that would, I think, perhaps produce the result that we want.\nCORNYN: Well, of course, torture is illegal under international treaties and under our domestic laws. And I've heard -- when I've heard people talk about torture in expansive ways, where things like sleep deprivation, other techniques that maybe you would employ as an alternative are considered torture to them, as well.\nBut under my hypothetical, if that were the only thing standing between you and the death of tens of thousands of Americans, you would decline to use that interrogation technique in order to save those lives. Is that correct?\nHOLDER: Well, again, I think your hypothetical assumes a premise that I'm not willing to...\nCORNYN: I know you don't like my hypothetical.\nHOLDER: No. Hypothetical is fine. But the premise that underlies it, I'm not willing to accept, and that is that waterboarding is the only way in which I could get that information from those people.\nCORNYN: Assume it was.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHOLDER: See, I -- given the knowledge that I have about other techniques, and what I've heard from retired admirals and generals and FBI agents, there are other ways, in a timely fashion, that you can get information out of people that is accurate and will produce useable intelligence.\nAnd so, it's hard for me to accept or to answer your hypothetical without accepting your premise. I don't think I can do that.\nCORNYN: One last question, quickly. You're aware that some of the techniques that are used -- aggressive questioning techniques are used as part of training by American military officers and enlisted men as part of their own survival training, are you not sir?\nHOLDER: Well, it's my understanding -- and I might be wrong here -- that we acquaint our people with those techniques so they can have some familiarity, some understanding of what it is they might face, if they are captured by people who are far less -- well, put it out there -- far less civilized, far less humane, far less conversant with the rules of law and war, so that they understand that.\nThat is not necessarily because that's done, it's something that we are condoning. It's just to make them, to the extent we can, more resistant to the techniques that might be applied to them.\nCORNYN: Thank you very much.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Cornyn.\nWe -- let's see. Earlier today, the assistant Democratic leader from Illinois was the senior and junior senator from that state. He is back again as just senior member. We noted here, Senator Durbin in the hall earlier, that your new colleague has been sworn in.\nAnd I would also note that he's the chair of our Human Rights Subcommittee. That's a subcommittee that was created when Senator Durbin -- because of Senator Durbin's longtime interest in this subject. And he's chaired it to great bipartisan praise.\nSenator Durbin?\nDURBIN: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. That was very kind of you. And I apologize for stepping out, but for the purpose noted. It was to add another Democratic vote, which, as the whip of the Democrat Caucus, I thought was a high priority for me and for our future president.\nHOLDER: I won't argue with that, senator.\nDURBIN: You'd better not.\nMr. Holder, I'm honored that you're here today. And I was present for your opening statement. I reflected on it, because I paid special attention to this issue of torture.\nAt times, it has been a source of torture politically, and for me, for some of the things I've said and questions I've raised. But I felt from the outset that it really struck at the fundamentals of who we are as Americans.\nArthur Schlesinger, Jr., the late historian, said that, and I quote, no position taken has done more damage to the American reputation in the world ever than on the torture policy of this outgoing administration.\nIt led me to vote against Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, as well as his successor, Attorney General Michael Mukasey. I felt that they were equivocal, and in the case of Gonzales had been involved in the formulation of that policy. I listened to your opening statement. And in three words -- in three words -- the world changed as far as I'm concerned, because you stated without hesitation, \"Waterboarding is torture.\"\nI can't tell you how many times Senator Whitehouse and I asked that of the current attorney general. And we could never, ever get a straight, declarative sentence.\nI think it's important -- important for our country, important for our position in the world. And I understand Senator Cornyn's questions. I think they are questions that everyone who watches Jack Bauer on \"24\" would ask. And most Americans do. I have. It's a different scenario.\nAnd when we're going to draw values and principles and laws, we have to really be cognizant of the fact that you can always construct a scenario that'll challenge the foundation of any legal principle. And I think it is far better for us to stand by standards that have guided our nation for generations, and return to them now with this new administration.\nThe Judge Advocates General are the top military justice lawyers in America. And I've asked them about the techniques other than waterboarding -- painful stress positions, threatening detainees with dogs, forced nudity, mock execution. And they told me that each of those techniques is illegal and violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\nWhen I asked Attorney Generals Gonzales and Mukasey the same question, they refused to respond.\nI think it's only fair that I ask you that question. Let me ask you that question directly.\nDo you agree with the Judge Advocates Generals? Would it be illegal for enemy forces to subject an American detainee to painful stress positions, threatening detainees with dogs, forced nudity or mock execution?\nHOLDER: I am not as conversant with those techniques as I am with waterboarding as something I really kind of focused my attention on. And so, I would not go so far as to say that those constitute torture. I don't know enough about them.\nOn the other hand, Common Article 3 requires that people -- prisoners be treated in a humane fashion. And so, I would agree that the techniques that you have described, I would agree that the folks in the Judge Advocate General Corps are in fact correct, that those techniques violate Common Article 3.\nDURBIN: So, in your mind, that cross that threshold and become inhumane.\nHOLDER: I believe that's right.\nDURBIN: I was interested in the questions asked earlier about rendition. I won't return to that issue.\nI'm sorry that our colleague -- we're all sorry that our colleague, Senator Kennedy, cannot be with us today. And when the new organizational chart comes out, for the first time in 46 years, he won't be on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we're going to miss him.\nOne of the issues that he cared about dearly, and I shared his concern, was the issue of immigration. And I'd like to ask you a question or two about that.\nWe've had decisions made, policies implemented by the this administration about the legal rights of those who are charged with being in this country illegally.\nThe so-called streamlining regulations of this administration drastically reduced the time that immigration judges devote to each case, increasing the number of decisions issued with no written opinion, and resulting in a huge backlog of cases in the federal appeals courts.\nNow, Richard Posner is a judge I know in Chicago. You probably know Judge Richard Posner as well as I do. He is probably as conservative as they come. But he and I get together for lunch once a year, and we talk about the issues before us.\nAnd he was unequivocal in what he said about what's happened as a result of these new policies. He issued an opinion in which he concluded, \"The adjudication of immigration case at the administrative level has fallen below the minimum standards of legal justice.\" That's a quote from Judge Posner.\nWhat are your views on these questions, about the streamlining regulations, the administrative reviews, the delays and the backlogs? Do you believe that they have compromised the basic standards of justice in America?\nHOLDER: Well, I believe that in any proceeding in which the United States is a participant, we have to be fair, and we have to be perceived as being fair, whether it is a criminal proceeding where death is a possibility as an option for a convicted defendant, or we're making a determination about what the immigration status is of somebody.\nWe have to make sure that people are given, if not a technical, legal due process -- all the technical, legal due process that somebody might get in a trial -- we have to make sure that using that word, that phrase expansively, that everybody gets due process -- we are true to ourselves, true to our nation, true to who we are as a people, if we do that. We cannot hold ourselves out as better than other nations -- and I think we are -- unless we do those kinds of things and commit ourselves to doing it.\nIt's not easy. It necessarily means an expenditure of resources. This is a difficult time for us, trying to figure out where limited resources are going to go. And yet, that in some ways is the ultimate test.\nIt's an easy thing to adhere to your values in times that are non-stressful, where the money is flowing. This is really the test, when we are at war in a couple places around the world, when we have budgetary concerns.\nThis is the test for America. Are you really who you say you are? I believe we are. And I believe, with the appropriate leadership, we can handle and deal with the issues that you're talking about.\nDURBIN: I trust that you will consider reviewing the policies and regulations that led to this current situation involving the review of immigration cases.\nHOLDER: I'll certainly do that. But more than that, what I'd like to do is work with the members of this committee, to come up with ways in which we are true to ourselves, true to our values, and come up with the necessary resources, so that we are able to do that.\nDURBIN: I know Mr. Schumer asked you earlier about this Mr. Schlozman, Bradley Schlozman, in terms of people he hired in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. And I know he asked you about the question of whether he was subject to prosecution.\nI'd like to ask you I guess a more practical question. According to the inspector general's report, Mr. Schlozman hired 63 career attorneys into the Civil Rights Division, who had demonstrably conservative or Republican Party Convention credentials. He hired only two career attorneys who were identifiable as Democrats. He clearly was applying some sort of ideological litmus test, in clear violation of the Civil Service Reform Act.\nSo, those 63 career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division comprise almost 20 percent of the entire workforce in that division. So, they technically have civil service protection. They were appointed to these positions, apparently in contravention of the Civil Service Reform Act.\nWhat's the recourse here? Are you forced to accept those 63?\nHOLDER: I'm not sure what the recourse is, but I don't think we should paint with too wide a brush who these people are, these 63 lawyers at the Justice Department in the Civil Rights Division.\nI don't know who they are. They could be very well-intentioned people, dedicated to the mission of the Civil Rights Division. It doesn't mean, because they are conservative, because they are Republican, that they should not have the jobs that they now hold.\nI think the focus really ought to be on the mechanism that was used to get them into the department.\nDURBIN: I agree with that.\nHOLDER: And what he did is deplorable. What he apparently did in front of this committee, according to the inspector general, by not telling the truth is also deplorable.\nAnd as I indicated -- I think it was to Senator Feinstein -- should I be confirmed as attorney general, I'm going to review the decision, the determination made by the U.S. Attorney's Office here in D.C. -- again, that I have great respect for -- but I'm going to review that determination, to make sure that their decision to decline prosecution was an appropriate one.\nDURBIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Holder.\nMr. Chairman, I yield.\nLEAHY: Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nI'd recognize our friend from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn. And good to have you here. Good to have -- you have waited here very, very patiently. And I...\nCOBURN: Happy to do it, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Glad to have you here. Please, the floor is yours.\nCOBURN: Thank you.\nWell, welcome again. I'm sure we're going to be here a while.\nA couple of things. I handed you a list of supposed wastes and problems within the Justice Department. It totals nearly $10 billion.\nAnd the reason I gave that to you is, one of the things that we worked on this past year, but was not funded, but the Justice Department did have was a cold case initiative on unsolved civil rights crimes.\nAnd I'm just going to ask you for a commitment today. Whether we fund that or not, will you commit to make sure that the intent of the Emmett Till unsolved civil rights crimes are fulfilled?\nYou have plenty of money there to do it, even if we don't fund it. And I'm looking for a commitment that that will become a priority under your management of the Justice Department, whether we do a good job of funding it or not. I think there's plenty of money for you to move around, both in terms of grants to states. And I'd like a response on that.\nHOLDER: The fact that that initiative exists, that this committee, that this Congress thought it important enough to devote its attention to it, is an indication of this committee, our government at its best. I actually believe that.\nThose are crimes committed a long time ago that, without the perseverance and the conscience that I think this committee demonstrated, could have been forgotten. They are stains on our nation's history. There are still raw feelings about what happened.\nAnd so, yes, you do have my commitment. And I'll figure out ways to try to move money around.\nCOBURN: The commitment's in the name of the board, the Emmett Till Board, and one gentleman in particular, Alvin Sykes. And we owe a great deal of gratitude to him.\nI tried to make that a more efficient bill. I wasn't able to do it. And we all sent out press releases, but it still isn't funded, and it still isn't happening. And what needs to happen is it needs to happen, whether we fund it or not. There's plenty of move in there.\nI want to go back to FALN for a minute, being from Oklahoma, and the tremendous tragedy that we had there. And I've heard your statements in terms of reasonableness.\nWhy did not the weight of the prosecutors and the victims' families bear more on your decision in terms of thinking that that was a reasonable pardon? Tell me how you came to this idea that it's -- you know, it's possibly reasonable.\nHOLDER: I mean, I did factor that into my determination. You had two United States attorneys who weighed in against it. Law enforcement was against it. There are obviously the feelings that victims had. And we took those into -- I took those into -- let's talk about me -- I took those into account, and balanced that against the people who were advocating for it, an impressive group of people.\nAlso looked at the nature of the crimes, the duration of the sentences that they had served. And it seemed to me that on balance, on balance -- it was a difficult decision -- but on balance, in a pre- 9/11 world, that the sentences that they had -- substantial sentences, up to 19 years, 16, 19 years -- that that was appropriate, that the clemency petitions were appropriate.\nThat was what -- those are the factors I considered.\nCOBURN: So, when we had our conversation together in the office, which I enjoyed very much, you admitted to a couple of mistakes of judgment. But you would tell this committee now, you don't think that was one of them.\nHOLDER: No, I think we can certainly have a difference of opinion about that. But I don't think that what I did there was a mistake in the same way that I would describe what I did in the pardon, the Rich pardon matter, as a mistake.\nCOBURN: I just have to kind of think back. And the fact that, if Terry Nichols were to get clemency right now, what would the people of Oklahoma think? You know.\nHere's the co-conspirator in the Oklahoma City bombing. And under the same circumstances, you know -- which, granted, there is some differences in the case, but there's not a whole lot of difference. One is aiding and abetting versus commission of an act. So, that is still worrisome to me.\nI want to spend some time -- I talked with you about the Heller decision in my office. I believe the Second Amendment right -- I believe the Supreme Court got it right. And I know your position on it, and I know you have publicly stated that that's the law of the land now, in terms of our individual right to hold and own a gun.\nPost-Heller, can you kind of give me what your position is now? You've been -- you know, there's a lot of publicity out there in terms of written statements and previous comments about what you believe the Second Amendment.\nTell me where you sit today, and more specifically, with that thought as attorney general of the United States, what you would do with that.\nHOLDER: Well, I think that post-Heller, the options that we have in terms of regulating the possession of firearms has been narrowed. I don't think that it has been eliminated. And I think that reasonable restrictions are still possible.\nBut any time that we think about interfering with what the Supreme Court has said is a personal right. That has to be factored in now with the Heller decision and the Supreme Court's view of the Second Amendment.\nI don't think that that means that we should turn away from the efforts that we have made to make this nation more safe, to be responsible about guns and who has them, how they are used. I mean, our effort, for instance, to go after felons in possession of weapons, I mean, should be as strong now as it was pre-Heller.\nBut I think that there is certainly -- we're in a different world. I think we operated for a good many years with the assumption that the Second Amendment referred to a collective right. We now know that that is not the case.\nAnd so, we are still, I think, going to have to grapple with that and understand what that means. But I think it is a huge factor. It's a major difference.\nCOBURN: Let me ask you specifically. Much of your statements in the past had to do with guns as far as sporting events.\nDo you believe there's any assurance given by Heller that, outside of sporting use, there's a right to own and hold a gun?\nHOLDER: Outside of...\nCOBURN: Utilization for sport -- for hunting, for skeet shooting, for target practice. Do you believe that there's a right to own a gun for other than hunting or sportsman's purposes?\nHOLDER: I think, post-Heller, absolutely. I mean, that's one of the things that we're dealing with in Washington, D.C., now.\nCOBURN: What kind of common sense gun regulations would you like to see enacted?\nHOLDER: Well, I agree with President-elect Obama. You know, closing the gun show loophole, banning the sale of cop-killer bullets, things of that nature, those are, I think, the things that we need to focus on. Those are things I think have a law enforcement component to them. Those are things that I think are still viable in a post- Heller world.\nCOBURN: Do you find any irony in the fact that you can serve your country in the military at 18, but in some places we would want to limit your ability to own a weapon until you're 21?\nHOLDER: Well, I don't -- well, I guess there is a bit of dissonance there. These decisions are made on, I guess, a state-by- state basis.\nYes, I guess there is some dissonance there.\nCOBURN: As attorney general, will you make the commitment to defend the Heller's holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms?\nHOLDER: Sure. That is the law as the Supreme Court has given it to me.\nCOBURN: Would you do so, if the Supreme Court granted cert in a case affecting or revisiting Heller?\nHOLDER: I'm sorry. Would I...\nCOBURN: Would you also defend Heller, if the Supreme Court were to grant cert in a case affecting or revisiting Heller?\nHOLDER: Oh, I see what you mean.\nWell, I mean, you have to examine the facts of the particular case and understand how those facts fit under the Heller determination. But Heller...\nCOBURN: Well, let's assume it does.\nHOLDER: OK. Well, I mean, we follow -- I'm a lawyer who follows the doctrine of stare decisis. The Supreme Court has spoken. And in viewing these new facts, one would have to take into account in a very substantial way, because it is the ultimate -- the ultimate arbiter has said what the Second Amendment means. I have to take that into account in deciding what position the Justice Department will take.\nI mean, Heller is a significant, significant opinion.\nCOBURN: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the last part of that.\nHOLDER: Heller was a very significant opinion.\nCOBURN: Yes, it is. It's one I'm very happy about as a Second Amendment advocate, and as somebody from Oklahoma.\nIf the Court were to change, and yet Heller still holds, and it was challenged again, as the chief law enforcement officer of the country, you would be obligated to defend the stare decisis of Heller. Is that true?\nHOLDER: Sure. That would have to be something that would take -- that I'd have to take into consideration in determining what the Justice Department's position was on a new case, a new set of facts. That would be a factor.\nStare decisis would tell the solicitor general, me, that you have to take into consideration the fact of the Heller decision. Correct.\nCOBURN: I'm out of time. Thank you very much. We'll come back to this.\nHOLDER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: I do want to compliment the senator from Oklahoma for his rendition of \"Rocket Man.\"\nCOBURN: Thank you.\nLEAHY: You will probably not move Elton John from the charts, but you carried the tune better than the chairman could.\nCOBURN: Well, actually, I'm a Beach Boy generation. So, it was a little hard for me to move to the other genre.\nLEAHY: We'll do \"Margaritaville\" next time.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSenator Whitehouse?\nWHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, welcome to the committee. I'm pretty much at the tail end of a long and thorough at least first round of questioning.\nAnd I'd like to cycle back first to the beginning, just because of my respect and affection for the man, to remark on how pleased I was that Senator Warner, who served here for so long and with such distinction, for his first, I guess you could call it, official return to the body that he served, really is an embodiment of both independence and dignity -- two characteristics you share with him -- chose to do so to support your candidacy, and to call all of us to the better angels of our nature.\nI was touched and impressed. And I know he's not here any longer, but I would like to say that for the record anyway.\nOn a more personal note, I want to say how impressed I am with your kids. This has been a long episode for them. It is a lot -- it is a lot less exciting for them than it is for you... (LAUGHTER)\n... to be here. And it's a sign of what a wonderful upbringing they've had at the hands of their mom and grandmother, that they've represented your family so well here today.\nHOLDER: We will take into account the fact that they might otherwise be at school right now.\nWHITEHOUSE: That's right.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: And I should note that, at some point after the next break -- well, obviously, you do whatever you want to do. But -- and I should say -- and I'll certainly give you extra time for this.\nI mentioned to your mother that it's part of the Constitution few of us understand, that grandparents are required to spoil grandchildren.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd then the parents can deal with it afterwards.\nHOLDER: She's a very constitutional -- she's a good constitutional lawyer. She follows the Constitution quite well.\nWHITEHOUSE: We in the Senate have the good fortune and privilege to be present at occasionally extraordinary moments. One, for instance, was Senator Kennedy, who I'm thinking of today -- he's not with us, but other people have mentioned him -- his return to the Senate for the critical Medicare vote, where he made such a difference after his diagnosis.\nThe year before, it was probably Senator Schumer's hearing in this committee, that brought Deputy Attorney General Comey before us, to tell an appalling and astonishing tale of the mission to Attorney General Ashcroft's bedside.\nDeputy Attorney General Comey and FBI Director Mueller with their lights on, racing to the hospital, pounding up the stairs to try to get there, the FBI director calling ahead to the agents by the stricken attorney general's bedside to tell them, whatever you do, don't leave this man alone in the room with the White House counsel and chief of staff to the president. Don't let them throw Comey out of the room.\nAnd then, after that, we've learned about the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between the Department of Justice and the White House.\nJim Comey's testimony was remarkable. I know he is a supporter of yours, that he supports your nomination, and that he's written to us on your behalf.\nWhat struck me was the personal nature of some of his discussion, of how lonely and exposed it felt to be that far out under that much pressure, standing on that principle. And I know you have been there as well.\nAs a United States attorney, you were there when you indicted and convicted the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- probably one of the handful of most powerful men in this town. You were there again as deputy attorney general when you cleared a special prosecutor to go after a member of the Cabinet of the president who appointed you. And you were certainly there when you cleared the expansion of the investigation of the president himself who had appointed you.\nIf you don't mind me asking you a personal question, can you tell us a little bit about what you were feeling at those moments? And in those moments, if it was lonely, as I suspect it was, what were your touchstones that gave you the courage and confidence to go forward and continue with those difficult decisions?\nHOLDER: Well, I appreciate the question, Senator Whitehouse. And I'm sure you have felt those moments, as well, having been the United States attorney, and having had to make those lonely decisions.\nI think you go back to the beginning and why you took -- or why we took those jobs. You wanted to do the right thing. We swore to an oath to uphold the law.\nAnd if you're going to be a good prosecutor, you have to treat the facts that come before you, irrespective of the political party of the person who might be involved and the connection they might have to you, personal or otherwise, the impact that it's going to have on the administration that you serve.\nThat is why the attorney general is different. It has to be, in some ways, distant from the Cabinet and even from the president that the attorney general serves.\nPersonally, those were not necessarily difficult decisions, because it's what I expected of myself, and what people who mean something to me would expect of me -- not difficult in that sense. But they were, nevertheless, ones that, after made, I think you reflect on.\nAnd you have feelings about the impact of those decisions on the lives of people who you admire, people who you have worked with. It doesn't give you any great sense of joy to have done them. And yet, it is what you are called on to do.\nIt is what I will do, if I am fortunate enough to become the next attorney general of the United States, to make those kinds of decisions in the way that I have in the past -- lonely ones, as you've described them, but the right decision. I think I've shown a capacity to do it in the past, and a determination to do it in the future.\nWHITEHOUSE: Thank you.\nLet me rattle off a few quick questions. The Bush administration knocked down the firewall between the Department of Justice and the White House, limited conversations on cases to a very, very small number of officials.\nI have many disagreements with Attorney General Mukasey, but to his credit, he did rebuild that firewall. Would you pledge to us to maintain it?\nHOLDER: I will. I've been presumptuous enough that we have actually started working on that in anticipation for whoever might be attorney general -- I'm not going to be so presumptuous there -- so that the communication between the White House and the Justice Department reflects that which Judge Mukasey has put in -- or Attorney General Mukasey has put in place -- and is consistent with what existed during the Clinton administration.\nWHITEHOUSE: The tainting -- some would even say corruption -- of the Department of Justice during the course of this administration has been both pervasive and systematic. It is my view that, frankly, if we went down this committee and everybody listed something that bothered them that had happened, and you had that whole list assembled, there'd still be more.\nIn that regard, what process do you think is appropriate coming on, to use a sailing metaphor, is the new captain of the ship, to do a damage assessment, see what needs to be fixed? And that way you can move on to the business, but you will know, as the commander of the department, that there is a process in place to make sure that whatever has been left undone that ought to have been done, or whatever had been done that ought not to have been done, is set right.\nHOLDER: Well, I think you set it out. An assessment has to be done. And that assessment has already begun in the transition effort that is ongoing. Attorney General Mukasey, Deputy Attorney General Philip (ph), have been most generous in sharing information with us, have been honest with us, very frank with us in pointing out places that they think need special attention.\nI have to say about those two gentlemen, that the only thing that they were not given was the luxury of time. I think that, given more time, they would have done more.\nBut we're going to have time. Hopefully, I will be one of the people who will have that time. And it is incumbent upon those who will run the Justice Department to do that damage assessment. What is -- given what has happened, where does the damage still exist, and then come up with mechanisms to try to repair that.\nA lot of it will be inspirational. There are a lot of people who are still down in the department. So, there has to be that kind of connection. I think it's going to have to be a personal connection.\nI think, should I be confirmed, I'm going to have to spend a lot of time walking the halls, getting on airplanes and talking to people in the field at the various U.S. attorneys offices, and making them feel a sense of mission, that the Justice Department is back in the way that it traditionally has been -- and as I said previously, under Republican and Democratic attorneys general and presidents.\nWHITEHOUSE: Our distinguished chairman was courteous enough to say I could have a little more time. And so, let me trespass on his indulgence with one final question.\nThere's been some discussion about the prosecution of false statements to Congress in addition to the recent OIG report about false statements by Department of Justice officials to Congress. I have referred a matter involving the EPA administrator to the Department of Justice regarding false statements to the Environment and Public Works Committee. I think that, frankly, it's been something of a recurring problem.\nAnd in addition to asking you to review the District of Columbia U.S. Attorney's Office determination, I would ask you if you would consider working with us on what might be appropriate prosecution guidelines for such offenses, and what might be appropriate notice or training to people who come before us about the obligation that they take on when they testify.\nBecause I think people tend to forget that they're here under oath. And I think I've heard stuff that's everything from simply slipshod to outright cold-blooded lies.\nHOLDER: Well, I think there's certainly an obligation on the part of those of us in the executive branch to make sure that those who testify on behalf of the agencies that we lead or could lead, that they're armed with all the tools that they need, so that they can acquit themselves in a way that we would expect them to.\nI think the point that you make about training -- testifying is not necessarily something that comes to people naturally. I've done this more than a few times, and I've got to tell you that this process has still frightened me.\nAnd to put younger people, who have not done it before, before, you know, senators, congressmen like yourselves without training them, without making them understand the significance of what it is they are doing, without making them understand what's on the line, reflects poorly on people who run those agencies.\nHOLDER: So, I will take that suggestion as a good one, and try to work with the people in the department so that what we had seen in the recent past is not replicated in the Justice Department that we will have.\nWHITEHOUSE: I thank you.\nAnd I thank the distinguished chairman.\nLEAHY: I thank you.\nMy friend, the senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback is here. I'll yield to him.\nAnd then after his questions, we will take a break to give everybody a chance to stretch as the members of Obama family that are out in the hall hardly have gotten any news.\nSenator Brownback?\nBROWNBACK: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nThe nominee...\nLEAHY: That's the Holder family, I'm sorry.\nBROWNBACK: So, congratulations on the nomination.\nI do have a number of questions to ask you but I want to congratulate you and your family for an extraordinary American journey. And it has been that.\nI want to start off on Guantanamo Bay. And one of the places that people are talking about moving the Guantanamo Bay detainees is Fort Leavenworth, Kansas which is in my state.\nThe Fort Leavenworth does not want these detainees. If I could put it any clearer to you, I would. But they don't want these detainees.\nAnd the reason they don't want these detainees is that it really gets in the way of their primary mission which is education.\nThis is the Command and General Staff College at the military which is at Fort Leavenworth. It's a small base. It also has a disciplinary brig but it's an eight square-mile base. It has no perimeter fence. It's bordered on the Missouri River. It has a train that regularly goes through about every 15 minutes. It has major sources of terrorist target points that they could go at.\nBut that's only one piece of it. The primary mission of Fort Leavenworth is to train a next generation of Army and military leaders.\nAnd as the Command and General Staff College -- Secretary Powell went through this facility. I just checked today. I'm looking at these numbers. We currently have 111 students from 91 different countries at Fort Leavenworth today.\nAnd we have heard from students from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan that they will leave the school if the detainees come to Fort Leavenworth.\nAnd the point is that a number of Islamic countries don't think these detainees should be held anywhere. And then if you hold them at the same place that they're training their next generation of Army and military leaders, they're saying, we're out of here, we're gone.\nAnd so, the people there in the base are saying, you're really messing with the primary mission. And on top of that, the relationships are built there often between army officers -- our army officers and the ones from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- are key relationships in the ongoing war on terrorism.\nAnd if you hurt that by moving detainees to a place at Leavenworth that's not fit anyway to move this, this is a big hit. And I would just plead you really to look at the specifics.\nI heard your clear statement earlier that you're closing Guantanamo but this physical plan doesn't fit and the mission is significantly harmed if these detainees are moved to Fort Leavenworth.\nAnd I would hope you would conduct an open and a very clear process before any are moved anywhere, particularly looking at a place like Fort Leavenworth.\nHOLDER: Senator, I will pledge to do that.\nThere is a review now that is underway to try to figure out what might happen with whatever the number of people are who might have to be moved once that assessment of what the population of Guantanamo looks like.\nYou've raised very, very important points. The inability to have people from Islamic countries leave and then cut short that interaction that they might have with our military is really something that over the long term could harm the interest of our nation.\nSo, that factor would be one that I will take back to the discussions that we're having. I think that -- it's definitely something that I heard before but I think that's a very important point. BROWNBACK: That's a big issue for them and I have spoken to Secretary Gates and the chairman of joint chiefs about this as well.\nLast Congress, Senator Kennedy and I successfully worked to pass a prenatally and postnatally diagnosed conditions act and there's no reason I expect you to know about that bill but what it was targeted at was to provide an adoption list for children borne with Down Syndrome.\nRight now, if you do the in utero test for Down Syndrome, 80 percent of the children are aborted. And both Senator Kennedy and I thought that was a really tragedy.\nWhat we need to do is to try to figure a system to try to encourage that they would be warned. And this is a very tough situation, if you can't handle it, there are people that want to do this, rather than killing the child.\nAnd we also put in that there would be current information put forward about life expectancy of Down Syndrome children, conditions for early treatment. And we're both very proud that we could get this.\nThe Kennedy family has been great on working with people with disabilities and I was delighted to partner with him on it.\nThe thing I find extraordinary is that the Americans with Disabilities Act, part of which, the Justice Department will be enforcing applies and protects people with disabilities yet we tend to not apply it. But at a certain point of life and the children tend to be killed before it gets applied to them.\nI would hope you would review with them, the Department of Justice, when you would apply the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nI know there are other agencies that have jurisdiction and maybe primary jurisdiction over this but that you would look at when do we apply the ADA.\nI don't know if you're familiar with that or if you could make a point of view on it.\nHOLDER: I think a core of what you're talking about are very personal, difficult decisions that people would have take...\nBROWNBACK: I'd say a very legal question on your part.\nHOLDER: ... but I think the legal determination is based on what the Supreme Court has said in essence are personal decisions tied to the right to privacy. I think the legislation that you described, that you worked on with Senator Kennedy, is admirable.\nThe possibility of adopting Down's children, that's obviously a wonderful thing. The application of the statute that you mentioned in, I guess, a prenatal sense, I just don't know what the impact of that would be on...\nBROWNBACK: Can you see the disconnect here?\nIf that child gets here, it's protected as the ADA applies. If it doesn't, 60 to 80 percent are killed.\nI would hope you would look at that and say that this should be applied at an earlier point because clearly the intent is to protect this child, not to kill it.\nFinally, and I want to get into this and I hope we can get into more in the second round. I looked at your background and as much of which I find very impressive and admirable, the Marc Rich case really bothers me.\nAnd I looked at this and a guy that renounces his U.S. citizenship and works with Iran in weaponry that maybe is being used against our allies in the Middle East and is a fugitive, and then you allowed this to move on forward.\nI just -- that one just seems to me to be really extraordinary. And when I go through the factual setting of it, you're a thorough lawyer. You wouldn't be where you are today if you weren't a thorough lawyer.\nThis case just screams out. It's something that it seems like you had pushed back aggressively against. And then it has the political connections to it as well.\nOne of the things I've been very troubled about lately is the number of political corruption cases we've had going on in the United States. And you've had several recently.\nAnd then this one has a connection where his former wife is giving money to the president's library, where this is going to at the late last minute. I just think it undermines confidence in the overall system.\nAnd I haven't heard yet, really, a satisfactory explanation to me from you about how you let that one go through given the nature of this case.\nI asked Mr. Chairman for the record that the letter dated January 12th of this year from the -- this is detailing what the House Committee have put forward sent by Congressman Dan Burton, be entered into the record that goes to some of the specific dates and the hearing -- the lengthy hearing at the House that the House did on this.\nI just -- I look at all those things. That one seems to be really out of stream given the thoroughness that you've operated with in the past and it seems to have a lot of political connections to it. And it really troubles me.\nHOLDER: Well, as I indicated in my opening statement, I think, in response to questions put to me by senators Specter and Hatch, I've made mistakes in that matter.\nOne thing I want to make clear, though, with regards to this notion of political connections, I was not aware at that time about the contributions or the ties that existed between Mr. Richard's wife and other people in the Democratic Party, things of that nature, with regard to questions about the facts and some of the ones that you had mentioned.\nThat was the mistakes I made. I did not acquaint myself in a way that I should have about all that existed in the files about Mr. Rich.\nI think had I done that, I would have come up with a different determination; but that is one of the things that I have said consistently during Mr. Burton -- Congressman Burton's hearings and interviews that I've done before this committee today that that was one of the mistakes that I made.\nI think, as I've also said, that my record should be viewed in its entirety. And as you make your determinations as to whether you think I'm fit to serve as attorney general, this matter in which I made mistakes, I think, should be contrasted with a whole host of other decisions that I've had to make where I think I got it right which is not to minimize -- I don't mean to do that. I'm not minimizing the mistakes that I made there but I do think that -- I would hope that this will be placed with all the contents.\nLEAHY: The senator from Kansas has asked consent for a letter to be introduced into record. I apologize if I didn't hear that. Of course, it would be introduced into record.\nSenator Hatch, you wanted to say something before we recess?\nHATCH: I'll be very short, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, you've acquitted yourself well.\nFirst of all, I support you and believe that you should be supported. And let me just make this one comment and I won't make it as a point of question. I just want to see what you think.\nFirst, as you may have heard today, an advice of court of review, at least its earlier decision, that the Protect America Act of 2007 which allows warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance is constitutional.\nNow, I know that everyone will have to study the decision but I wanted to note particularly the court, quote and quote, \"We hope that a foreign intelligence exception in the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign power reasonably believed to be located outside the United States,\" unquote.\nNow, this is very significant decision.\nAnd Mr. Chairman -- and your answers to me earlier to be consistent with this decision. You're willing to be bound by the Constitution and I know you would be and I appreciate you saying that.\nAnd Mr. Chairman, I ask consent that an article from today's New York Times written by Eric Lichtblau about this decision, the \"Intelligence Court Rules Wiretapping Legal\" be put into record at this point.\n(UNKNOWN): Objection, it will be, unless...\nHATCH: Mr. Chairman, if I could just, one other thing.\nThis is difficult for you to go through but there are some points. And I just want you to know that I've been carefully monitoring this and you're part of the family, not just part of the family but I look forward to you being confirmed and serving in this really important position and I hope that you'll do it in a non- partisan way which I think you will.\nAnd I hope that the mistakes of the past will influence you even further towards being a great attorney-general and that's what I'm expecting of you.\nAnd thank you Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: All right. Thank you.\nHATCH: And I'm sorry if I...\nLEAHY: No, I thank you, Senator Hatch for your comment. We've worked together on these matters for many years.\nOne of the things that stood out while you were on the following discussion by Senator Graham is Mr. Holder's willingness to sit not just in formal meetings but to have some informal gatherings with some of these issues with both Republicans and Democrats.\nI've always felt that law enforcement should not be a matter -- you don't get the law enforcement to say a crime is a Republican crime or a Democratic crime. If you've got a crime and a victim, you don't ask what their political parties are. You ask how you go about helping the victims catching the criminal and both the Republican and Democrats, I've been told, after the comment you've sent to me, they intend to take you up on that.\nWe'll stand in recess until the call of the chair.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: Thank you all.\nAnd, again, one of the things I heard universally is how Mr. Holder's great your children had been and glad to see you personally giving them a break.\nWe have a longstanding and valued member of this committee, the senior senator from Iowa and he is justifiably proud to be first author the False Claims Act and -- the modern version of it. And I know you've worked in that same area, Mr. Holder. You have not had your first round, is that correct?\nHOLDER: That's right.\nLEAHY: It seems like it was so long ago; but go ahead. I'll yield to the senior senator from Iowa so he can have his first round.\nGRASSLEY: Mr. Holder, first of all, obviously, I haven't given your department the attention I should today and been here all the time because I'm a ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee and we had four hours of discussion before we passed out a bill dealing with the Children's Health Insurance Bill.\nSo, that's where I've been.\nI'm a ranking senior Republican there and I had to be there. So, I'm sorry, I missed in. I hope I'm not repetitive, but if I am, please forgive me.\nThe LA Times recently reported that you urged pardon attorney Roger Adams to change his recommendations against clemency for Puerto Rican terrorists to a recommendation in favor of clemency for at least some of them. Then, after Roger Adams resisted, you directed him to draft a neutral options memo.\nI'd like to show you an FBI surveillance video secretly recorded in a Chicago apartment and ask you some questions. This chilling video shows Edwin Cortes and Alejandria (sic) Torres. These were two of the terrorists who received clemency from President Clinton after you directed that the Justice Department change its recommendations.\nThe video shows Cortes and Torres in the process of building a bomb. Were the two terrorists in this video in the group that you asked the pardon attorney to draft a positive recommendation for?\nHOLDER: Senator, I can't answer that question. I don't have the records in front of me. I don't know the names of the people who were among that group of 15, I guess.\nI don't know the answer to that.\nGRASSLEY: OK. Well, as I said, their names were Edwin Cortes and Alejandria (sic) Torres. At the time you directed the pardon attorney to draft a neutral options memo, had you ever seen this video before?\nHOLDER: No. I've not seen this video before.\nGRASSLEY: Are you weren't aware that the video existed?\nHOLDER: I think I've seen it in some news accounts in the recent past, like, over the last week or so, something like that.\nGRASSLEY: Were you aware that after this video was taken, a search to the apartment led to the seizure of 24 pounds of dynamite, 24 blasting caps, weapons, disguises, false identification, and thousands of rounds of ammunition?\nHOLDER: I can't say that I'm aware of that specific fact. I did know that the people who were a part of that group, for lack of a better term, had access to, had been captured with explosives. I don't know the amounts or whether it was in connection with this particular thing.\nGRASSLEY: Were you aware that FALN terrorists threatened to kill the judge at their sentencing hearing?\nHOLDER: That one I'm not. I'm not aware of that.\nGRASSLEY: Well, these are facts that I believe. So, let me ask you this. If you don't think that before the president decides to overturn the sentences of people like those in this video that were doing the things I said they were doing, that the Justice Department ought to make sure that he is aware of the important facts like these.\nHOLDER: I'm sorry. The question was...\nGRASSLEY: The question is don't you think that before the president, a president, in this case, President Clinton, decides to overturn the sentences of people like those in the video that we just showed doing what I said that they were doing, that the Justice Department ought to make sure that the president is aware of the important facts like these that I just stated.\nHOLDER: Yes. If the pardon process, the clemency process is working well, the president should have before him all of the relevant facts so that he can make an appropriate determination using the power that he has, fully informed.\nGRASSLEY: Yes. So then, let me get on this case to what I believe you said and how you characterized it in light of all that we've discussed here. Did you believe that it is fair to characterize Cortes and Torres, quote, unquote, \"non-violent,\" and, therefore, deserving a clemency?\nHOLDER: I'm not sure I ever described them as non-violent. What I said before was that -- I'm not -- I don't know if these two are the individuals are part of that 15 of that group. What I said is that with regard to the group of 15, none of them had themselves been directly linked to a murder or directly linked to a crime that involved an injury to somebody.\nCrimes of violence can be defined in a whole variety of ways that don't necessarily involve injury to a person. Some drug offences are considered crimes of violence even though a person has not been hurt. But the distinction I made was the way in which I phrased it at the beginning of the day, I guess, and throughout the day.\nGRASSLEY: Well, earlier today, you said in response to a question from Senator Sessions that the people who received clemency didn't actually hurt anyone and that you thought that the granting them clemency was reasonable, but isn't it true that the only person that the people in the video didn't hurt anyone is -- or why they didn't hurt anyone -- is because the FBI caught them before they got a chance to do their damage.\nHOLDER: Yes, that might be so, but that is, nevertheless -- you know, it's a difference between let's hypothetically say murder and attempted murder. If some -- there's an intervening act that stops the person from committing the crime that they wanted to do, the person's intent is certainly nefarious and worthy of punishment but the ultimate crimes are fundamentally different ones.\nGRASSLEY: On another pardon, I know that Senator Specter is going through the Rich pardon, but I have some details that I'd like to ask as well. In addition to being an unrepentative (sic) fugitive who had renounced his U.S. citizenship to avoid justice, Marc Rich was also a billionaire tax cheat.\nSpeaking as a ranking member of the Finance Committee where we talk an awful lot about tax gap and making sure that the tax laws are effective, it bothers me that giving Rich a get-out-of-the-jail free card happens and that's especially offensive to me.\nYou have admitted to poor judgment in your handling of this case. However, it is hard for many people to accept a general statement of regret because Rich was so obviously undeserving and because all that money that his ex-wife gave to political leaders just before the pardon made it look like a corrupt operation. I'd like to hear what you have to say to those people who think I made a mistake and I'm sorry just isn't enough. What specific facts or legal considerations led you to be neutral, leaning favorable to the Rich pardon? Was it a decision you made on fact, the law or political consideration?\nHOLDER: The mistakes that I made in the Rich matter as I think I said earlier all involved the fact that -- a variety of things -- among them, I should have been more informed about Marc Rich and his case. I was not.\nI should have kept the people who were involved in the prosecution in the Southern District of New York -- good lawyers -- and people at Main Justice who were involved in the pardon process, I should have kept them involved. I assumed that they were. I found out later that they were not.\nWith regard to the political stuff and the money going back and forth between, I guess, Rich's wife or supporters, whatever, that I did not know about. That did not enter into the decision or the actions that I took.\nWith regard to the question of what my recommendation was, when I said neutral, as I've testified, I guess, eight, nine years ago at this point, neutral was an inartful (sic) way of saying I don't know enough about this case. I should have used a different word, I suppose.\nWhen they talk about leaning towards favorable, what people frequently do not put to the end of that phrase is what I said was neutral leaning towards favorable if there was a foreign policy benefit that might be gained. And that was on the basis of the prime minister of Israel weighing in and supporting the pardon.\nI didn't say that I'm saying we should do this pardon. I said, \"Look, if there is a foreign policy benefit that somebody else will have to make the determination, if there is that, then that might be something that would make me think that this is something we ought to consider.\"\nGRASSLEY: If the attorney for Rich had been someone that you had no relationship with rather than former White House Counsel Jack Quinn, would you have been as sympathetic to his case as you were?\nHOLDER: I wasn't sympathetic to the case. All I did with regard to Mr. Quinn as I've done for any number of lawyers initially was to try to set up a meeting that he wanted to have with the people in the Southern District of New York to review his case.\nThe lawyers in the Southern District of New York refused to do that and that was the end of it. I didn't pressure anybody. I didn't question their judgment.\nI might have done it differently, but it was their case. They made the decision not to do it. When it came to the pardon component of this, I had, I think, two conversations with Mr. Quinn, one in November, another one on that last night in January. I wasn't particularly sympathetic.\nI didn't do anything to try to make this pardon happen. I certainly didn't perform as well, I think, as I should have. And had I performed as well as I was capable of doing, I might have done something more.\nI think I would have done more to try to prevent it, but I didn't do anything affirmatively to try to make the pardon happen.\nGRASSLEY: Well, I think maybe you just stated a partial answer to this next question. So, let me -- but let me ask it anyway. What do you think was your biggest mistake in the handling of the Rich pardon? And please be very specific about what you think you should have done differently.\nHOLDER: Yes. I should have made sure that I was better informed, that I knew more about the facts about the underlying case about the history of Mr. Rich. I should not have spoken to the White House and made the statements that I made without having had all of that knowledge.\nI should have ensured that the involved lawyers were actually a part of the process instead of assuming that they were. I think those are the mistakes that I made in connection with the Rich matter.\nGRASSLEY: Thank you. (OFF-MIKE)\nLEAHY: OK. Thank you.\nThe Freedom of Information Act or FOIA was something that Senator Cornyn and I have worked establishes a statutory presumption of disclosure of information that's in the possession of the federal government actually places the burden on the government to justify if they're going to be withhold anything from the American public.\nWhen requesters think they had been wrongly denied, of course, they can sue and the Justice Department defends against those lawsuits.\nNow, each new attorney general in position establishes what the ground rules are going to be on the FOIA. Attorney General Reno urged departments to disclose or on the side of disclosing unless there was a foreseeable harm.\nThe current policy we're using now is issued by then Attorney General John Ashcroft who reversed the presumption of disclosure to non-disclosure by telling federal departments and agencies the Justice Department would defend their action and not disclose it. They can make any kind of legal argument.\nWill you review the FOIA policies and practices and will you -- if you do review them, will you do it at least with a consideration to reopening the kind of openness, or to reestablish the kind of openness that FOIA was intended?\nHOLDER: I will pledge to do that. I don't know exactly how the administration is going to be structured and what traps I would have to run through in order to actually promulgate the policy but that which Attorney General Reno, her policy, I think, is the way -- the place where we ought to be and that would be what I would be working towards.\nAnd my thought would be -- my guess would be that the administration would support that.\nLEAHY: Much of the legislation I've worked on in a bi-partisan way, I might tell you, has been to improve the criminal justice system, improve and increase DNA testing, for example. The Justice for All Act passed in 2004 includes the Innocence Protection Act.\nI had worked with former Republican Congressman Ray LaHood, Democratic Congressman Bill Delahunt, the House's both former prosecutors that keyed the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program, the idea being we didn't want an innocent person in prison or on death row. But at the same time, as former prosecutors, we didn't want to see an innocent person go to jail knowing that that meant the guilty person is still out loose and could commit the same crime over again.\nThe Justice Department has been slow and affected, sometimes, obstructions as to implementing this program. They put a barrier that resisted funding key programs.\nThe fact of the matter is it's something that works well for both prosecution and the defense. Will you work with me and others in the Congress in both parties to see if the key DNA testing programs are effectively funded and implemented?\nHOLDER: I look forward to that, Senator. The Justice Department -- we in the Justice Department have not only a responsibility for trying to solve crimes and convict the people who committed them. The Justice Department, unlike maybe the responsibility that, I think, the defense attorneys have -- they have these more unique functions. We have a more unique function.\nWe have -- and especially those of us who potentially are in charge of the department -- have a responsibility to the system. And to the extent we can have tools that are made available to acquit people, exonerate people as well as find them guilty, those things should be supported.\nThat's what I was talking about, I think, earlier with Senator Kyl. I agree with what he said and what you are saying that there is a need for technology.\nLEAHY: We also have the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction Program for a reduced backlog of untested rape kits and all. These are all things that we should work at that will make law enforcement go better and, also, not only will keep innocent people from going to jail but will make it more effective and will get the actual person who committed the crime so they're not out there where they might commit the crime again.\nJust like the enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act, will you make enforcement of this a priority including enforcement in Indian Country?\nHOLDER: Yes, I will. It has been something that has been of importance to me since I was the United States attorney here in Washington, D.C. I started the domestic violence unit in the U.S. Attorney's office in D.C., having witnessed the crimes and the assaults that -- and the unique problems that these cases present while I was a judge here in Washington, D.C.\nI took the concerns that I saw, that were generated by what I saw as a judge into the U.S. Attorney's office and started a domestic violence unit. And so, I would be more than happy to work with you on...\nLEAHY: And, lastly, many of us from both parties work very, very hard to re-authorize the Voting Rights Act. We do it for everybody -- black, whites, Hispanic, whatever, they might be, poor, rich -- to make sure that the right to vote in this country is given to everybody.\nNow, it's -- there is a direct appeal to the Supreme Court on that, I understand, probably Senator Specter was with President Bush when he signed the reauthorization. Will you, if you're the attorney general, will you defend the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization before the United States Supreme Court?\nHOLDER: Yes. The Justice Department has as a matter of policy the obligation to defend federal statutes. I can't think of a statute that my department of justice, should I be confirmed, would be more proud to stand behind.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Specter?\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With only a five-minute round, I'll try to be brief on the questions and I'll appreciate your being brief on the responses.\nYou testified Mr. Holder that you're not intimately involved, only a passing familiarity with the Marc Rich case, yet the record shows that you met or talked with Quinn on October 22nd 1999, November 8th 1991, January 18th 2000, February 28th 2000, November 17th 2000, November 21st 2000. Do you stand by at testimony that you were not intimately involved, only had a passing familiarity with this matter?\nHOLDER: Yes. The conversations that I had with him dealt with, I think, certainly at the beginning part of it, the question of whether or not he was going to get a meeting with the U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York.\nWhen it came to the actual part, and I think I had two contacts with him -- one in November, one in January, I never had a detailed conversation with Mr. Quinn about the facts of the case. And I have said that that is a mistake that I had.\nI, you know, I shouldn't even have had that conversation with him or independently I should have acquired sufficiently knowledge so that I could have acted in a better way.\nSPECTER: Well, that doesn't sound like a passing familiarity to me, but we'll let that stand.\nWe came to the point as to whether you made any inquiry. According to the testimony of Roger Adams, the pardon attorney, he called you at 1 a.m. on January 20 because he was concerned that a pardon might be given to Marc Rich.\nYou testified this morning when I asked you about all these sordid details about Marc Rich, about trading with the Iranians during a hostage crisis, oil for arms, handheld rockets, dealing with the Soviet Union and Namibia, on apartheid government in South Africa in exchange for Namibian uranium. That was certainly an opportunity when Roger Adams, the pardon attorney called you. He opposed the commutation of Rich, the pardon of Rich, to find out what the facts were.\nWhen he called you at 1 a.m., wasn't that a pretty clear cut signal that he was very concerned to call you at home in the middle of the night, an occasion for you to say, well, what's up here, Mr. Adams? What are you so concerned about? And then you would have found out about all of these.\nHOLDER: Well, that's -- I suppose that could have happened. Now, the call, as I remember, the call with Roger at that time was to inform me, he might have actually called at 11 o'clock.\nI'm not sure. I think he might have -- but the call from Roger, I think, was to tell me that the Rich pardon had gone with it -- Pincus Green's were on the list.\nThe way I viewed those calls at that point, I thought we were dealing with a fait accompli, that the President of the United States on the last day in office at 11 o'clock at night, or whenever it was I got that call, had made up his mind and that the decision was a final one.\nI didn't expect that I would have the capacity to turn President Clinton's mind around that late in the administration. I mean, this was the last night of his administration.\nSPECTER: But you were on the record as saying neutral, leaning favorable, that the president there has a waiver of privilege on this pardon matters according to a letter from David Kendall to Congressman Dan Burton.\nDid President Clinton talk to you about the Rich pardon?\nHOLDER: I never spoke to President Clinton about the Rich pardon.\nSPECTER: You've been questioned extensively about FALN and, in the context of your testimony, that you have tried to follow and respect the career professionals on the FALN matter according to the Los Angeles Times, January 9th, 2009. Mr. Holder instructed the Pardon Attorney's office to, quote, \"Effectively replace the department's original report recommending against any commutation with one that favored clemency for at least half the prisoners.\"\nMr. Adams told the Los Angeles Times that he responded to Mr. Holder, quote, \"Of his strong opposition to any clemency in several internal memos and a draft report recommending denial and at least one face-to-face meeting but, each time, Holder wasn't satisfied.\"\nWell, Mr. Holder, if you wanted to make a recommendation of clemency, why didn't you have the directness to do so on your own without seeking the cover of the pardon attorney who had told you he was against it? Why submit a second request for a report after there has been opposition registered? HOLDER: All I asked Roger Adams to do was his job. The responsibility was -- what I asked him to do was to draft the memo that went from me. The memo did not go from Roger Adams or from anybody else.\nThe name that is on the memo is mine. It is a routine thing for the deputy attorney general to ask people who work for him to prepare memoranda...\nSPECTER: But he had told you he was opposed to it, and you go back to him and say, \"Change it. I want you to recommend clemency for at least half of these people.\" Why do you place the burden on him to give you cover if you want to make a recommendation of clemency?\nLEAHY: Senator, this time is up. But go ahead and answer the question.\nHOLDER: Well, I'm not asking for cover. I'm asking him as I said to do his job. And I would not get covered given the fact that the memorandum went from me.\nMy name is on that memorandum so that anybody can look at that and say, \"Well, now, who made this crazy decision?\" You look at it. It says from the Deputy Attorney General to the president.\"\nEric Holder's name is on it. Roger Adam's name is not.\n(CROSSTALK)\nLEAHY: Senator Kohl wanted to -- Senator Kohl wanted to ask his five minutes and then go to vote. As soon as he's finished there, if you want to ask one more question, go ahead.\nSenator Kohl?\nKOHL: I thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. If confirmed, you'll be responsible for a budget of nearly $26 billion. As you know, your allocation of that budget will provide us with some insight into your priorities.\nOver the past years, we saw a concerted effort by this administration to sharply reduce federal funding for local law enforcement, something many of us were deeply troubled by. Funding for improved and effective programs by cops earned in juvenile justice has been decimated.\nLast year, the president's budget requested a 60 percent reduction for state and local law enforcement programs, which was below its already inadequate levels of prior years. And as a result, vital services to our communities have been cut, police departments have had to downsize, local prosecutors have been laid off, thus, drug test forces have been eliminated, and prevention and intervention programs have had to scale back their services or even close their doors.\nGiven your support for these programs in the past, can we expect to see a real change here? Will restoring these programs to their funding levels of prior years before the Bush administration be a top priority of yours?\nHOLDER: Yes, Senator Kohl. This is one of my top priorities. One of the three things I mentioned on the day of my announcement was a need to increase support of our state and local partners not only because of what they traditionally do in helping us fight violent crime, but because also when it comes to the national security component, it is now such a big part of what the justice department does.\nThey are, in essence, I guess what we've come to call force multipliers. They can help us on the national security side by looking at that car that has somebody in it that doesn't look quite right. They have tools that they can use to analyze data information.\nThey can help us not only in the traditional way in which we thought of them. They could also help us on the national security side, so I think this has to be a priority for us.\nKOHL: Thank you. Mr. Holder, I was very disappointed with the sharp cutback of antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department during the 8 years of the Bush administration. When we conducted antitrust oversight hearing in 2007, we found sharp declines in the numbers of antitrust investigations initiated by the department. Many mergers among direct competitors and highly concentrated industries pass review without any modifications, including the XM Sirius, Whirlpool or Mayt -- Whirlpool and Maytag, and AT&T-BellSouth (NYSE:SBT) (NYSE:T) mergers, to name just a few.\nThe serious decline in antitrust enforcement has been very disturbing. Vigorous and aggressive enforcement of our nation's antitrust laws is essential to ensuring that consumers pay the lowest prices and gain the highest quality of goods and services.\nWhat's your view with respect to the importance of strong antitrust enforcement?\nHOLDER: It's a critical part of what the Justice Department does. It's especially true now where consumers in this nation are beset upon by so many different things -- the economic downturn or economic condition more generally. I think we have to make sure that we do all that we can to ensure that the American people, the consumers of this nation, have a system that is designed to be free, to be competitive.\nAnd, so, the antitrust enforcement will be something that we will devote a lot of attention to. We'll get an assistant attorney general who understands the mission of that division, the historic mission of that division, and I expect it will be more active.\nKOHL: One last question on resale price maintenance, Mr. Holder. For nearly a century, it was the basic rule of antitrust law that a manufacturer could not set a minimum price for a retailer to sell its product. This rule had this economy to flourish and greatly enhanced the competition for dozens of consumer products, everything from electronics to clothes.\nHowever, in 2007, a five-four decision of the Supreme Court in the Leegin case overturned this rule and held that vertical price fixing was no longer banned in every case. I believe that this decision is very dangerous to consumers' ability to purchase products at discount prices and harmful to retail competition.\nDo you agree with me on this principle that manufacture setting retail prices should be banned? Can we expect you to support that and provide a letter for us with respect to your position on this issue?\nHOLDER: This is something that we talked about in our meeting, Senator. And I have to say that that decision disturbs me. I'm not at all certain that, again, harkening back to our desire to protect the American consumer to make the market as open, as free as we can, that that decision by the Supreme Court is necessarily a good one, and, so, I would want to work with you to try to figure out ways in which we can bring the competitiveness back that I think perhaps the Supreme Court in that decision has removed from the system.\nI'm very concerned, very disturbed, by that decision and the implications of what flows from it. So, I look forward to working with you on that.\nKOHL: I thank you very much.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator, you want to finish your question or...\nSPECTER (?): I have -- but now I have two yes or no questions, no explanations.\nDid you talk to President Clinton about the FALN pardon?\nHOLDER: No, I did not.\nSPECTER (?): Would you make available to make the paper you referred to with respect to the request to Roger Adams on the Rich issue? We haven't been able to get a hold of a copy of that paper.\n(UNKNOWN): The FALN.\nHOLDER: I'm not sure I understand that.\nSPECTER (?): It's the FALN paper.\nHOLDER: OK. I'm sorry.\nGRASSLEY: Would you make available to me a copy of the FALN paper you've referred to?\nHOLDER: That is a document that belongs to the Justice Department. It is not, from my understanding, mine to give.\nSPECTER (?): Well, you referred to it in your testimony. HOLDER: Yes, I have seen the document, but it is not my document. It belongs to the Justice Department.\nSPECTER (?): Do you have the document?\nHOLDER: I have the document, but I'd have to give it back to the Justice Department. I signed an agreement that I will let no one see the document including the people who have worked with me. The only person who's allowed to see that document is me and I'm supposed to give it back to them when I...\nSPECTER (?): Well, I'll ask the Justice Department for it. Would you ask them to?\nLEAHY: We -- I think we've gone through five of your two questions.\nSPECTER (?): We have...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSPECTER (?): I have some more.\nLEAHY: OK. We'll stand on recess until the call of the chair.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nWe gave a little extra time to Senator Specter and I'm going to go back to Senator Feinstein. I'm going to try to keep the order the way it's supposed to be. I'll have five minutes for Senator Grassley.\nGRASSLEY: Right now?\nLEAHY: Yes.\nGRASSLEY: OK, thank you.\nI'll continue where I left off...\nFEINSTEIN: (OFF MIKE) Mr. Chairman, is this supposed to be here? I don't know whether I'm in a dead zone but I just can't hear.\nGRASSLEY: Can you...\nLEAHY: Having been in hearings with the Senator from California, I know she's not getting deaf, so it must be a dead zone.\nGRASSLEY: OK.\nLEAHY: All the -- is it on?\nGRASSLEY: Mine is on, yes.\nLEAHY: Try to... GRASSLEY: Can I go ahead?\nLEAHY: Yes.\nGRASSLEY: OK. On the night before the pardons were issued, January the 19th, Quinn's notes reflect a telephone call with you and what you said you had, quote, unquote, \"No personal problem with the pardon,\" but that you expected a, quote, unquote, \"howl\" from the Southern District once prosecutors, they found out about it.\nMr. Chairman, I would like to place some telephone notes in the record at this point...\nCHAIRMAN: No objection.\nGRASSLEY: And then, I have a chart that has these calls on them that you can look at.\nYou testified before the House that you do not remember saying you had no problem with the pardon, but you remember the comment about the howl from the Southern District?\nHOLDER: At this point Senator, I mean, we're talking about something that happened, what, 2001?\nSo, that's 8 year ago. I don't remember that. But I find that comment interesting because if I said that, that in some ways indicates that I'm working under the assumption that the Southern District knows about this.\nI don't -- although I see quotes around, only part of it and then something that says when they find out which appears not to be from, I guess, from this piece of paper that I was just handed. So, I don't remember.\nGRASSLEY: OK. Well, as a prosecutor, would you agree that notes like these are taken at a time or just after a conversation where a much more reliable evidence and some of this memory on the conversation months or years later?\nHOLDER: As a general matter, I'd say that that's true. I wouldn't say that that's true of the particular piece of paper that I have in front of me.\nI would want to know exactly what were the circumstances under which this was generated, what were the conditions. I mean there's a lot of questions I would want to know about this piece of paper. I would agree with you generally.\nGRASSLEY: Well, would you have in your possession any notes that would support a different account of the conversation?\nHOLDER: No, I didn't take any notes of any of the conversations that I had. I'm not in a habit of taking notes of conversations I have.\nGRASSLEY: Do you have any explanation why Mr. Quinn would have written these notes if they weren't true?\nHOLDER: No.\nGRASSLEY: OK.\nHOLDER: I take -- on the other hand, I don't know why he would have taken these notes but I -- one thing that sticks in my mind is this one that he took the note that said, supposedly, I could go straight to the White House. I know I did not say that.\nAnd that appears in a piece of paper or note that he took which gives me some pause with regard then to other things that he perhaps wrote. I'm not saying he's making things up. Maybe, he misinterpreted things. But that one, I know I did not say. This, I simply don't remember.\nGRASSLEY: Well, could I assume that based upon the notes that you did say something to Quinn on the night before the pardon about the prosecutors on the Southern District howling that seems to suggest that you knew that they were unaware that the pardon was being considered and that they would complain loudly if they knew.\nAfter all, if they knew the prosecutors would have been already out there yelling about it yet you testified before the House that you didn't ask to see the pardon petitions when Quinn first mentioned it because, quote, unquote, \"My belief was that any pardon petition filed with the White House ultimately would be sent to the Justice Department.\"\nIt's hard to believe that you assumed the Justice Department had been reviewing the petition since November 2000, yes, November 2000; but by January 2001, the prosecutors were not yet howling about it.\nIsn't it true that you knew on the night before the pardon that the prosecutors did not have a chance to weigh in and does in fact contradict to your testimony that you believe the White House would forward the petition to the Justice Department?\nHOLDER: No, actually, I think, as I said earlier, again, I've not seen this, you know, for some time and I think that the fact that you say, \"Holder says,\" there's only part of that that's in quote, howl from the Southern District.\nAgain, I don't remember saying that. But if, in fact, I said that, I think that actually points the other way.\nIt shows that there's an expectation -- assumption on my part that the people in the Southern District in fact know about this.\nNow, the part is when they find out, it does not have quotes around it so I don't know where that comes from.\nGRASSLEY: OK. My time is just about up.\nMr. Holder, during the house pardon hearing, you said repeatedly that you believed all along the president was extremely unlikely to grant the pardon. According to your testimony, that's why you failed to make sure the president heard both sides of the story.\nEssentially, you didn't think Justice Department input was necessary to stop it because Rich was a fugitive and that would disqualify him. However, less than a year earlier, you had successfully supported the petition for another fugitive Preston King.\nMr. King's case is very different from Marc Rich but they were fugitives and President Clinton had just pardoned King.\nIn light of the recent history, why would you say that you thought merely being a fugitive would disqualify Rich?\nHOLDER: Well, because the King case was really fundamentally different. That involved a person, an African-American who had been discriminated against. I don't remember -- I think it was a selective service case or something. I don't remember exactly what the facts were. But that had the indicia of something, of a wrong that needed to be righted.\nMr. King being a fugitive was not in the same category, a fugitive as Mr. Rich. They were just fundamentally different types of cases.\nI don't remember all the facts but I do remember it was something about a racial injustice that had happened to Mr. King.\nI think it has something to do with a graft (ph) case but I'm not sure about that.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Feinstein.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nMr. Holder, when I -- my time was used up in the morning, we were talking about the use of independent contractors that the CIA utilizes to carry out interrogation techniques and I mentioned that I wrote a letter to Mr. Mukasey in February of last year asking as to why this does not satisfy the inherently governmental strictures that must be used.\nThe FBI uses its own people, its own agents for interrogation. The military uses their own agents for interrogation or soldiers for interrogation. But the CIA uses only contractors.\nAnd it seems to me that the interrogation of detainees in a war fought by the United States is an inherently governmental function and I'd like to ask that you commit to re-review those decisions that I have the letters here which we will forward to you.\nHOLDER: I would be glad to, Senator Feinstein.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nLet me ask this question. It seems that one of the issues surrounding the closure of Guantanamo is what to do with the 80 or so detainees that likely will not be tried but have been adjudged to be unlawful combatants and a threat to US security.\nDo you believe that there are international treaties and specifically the law of armed conflict that would allow the detention of an enemy combatant for the duration of the conflict?\nHOLDER: I think -- I can't refer it to something specific but I think that's a generally accepted rule of war that during the course of a conflict, a person who is captured by the other side can be detained for the duration of the conflict but there are safeguards for that person.\nThere are ways in which that person has to be treated but I believe that is the general state of the law.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, if you assume, as I do, that as a law of armed conflict would cover this, then, and, that this is an unusual asymmetric war that's going to go on, that there should be some form of regular federal review of the case and do you have any thoughts on that and how -- should that be an annual review, which I would think would make sense to have a judge look at the case outside, thereby, provide some element of due process?\nHOLDER: Yes, that's one of the things I'd like to work with this committee on and one of the things I discussed with Senator Graham. I think that there has to be fairness at two spots: one, in making a determination if the person is an enemy combatant, is dangerous; and then two, a review of that decision on some periodic basis.\nI think a year is probably pretty reasonable because if we get to the point where we conclude that the person is not dangerous, then I think we need to go to the other phase which is to try to repatriate the person, take the person to some other country.\nGiven the fact that this is a war, it may go on for an extended period time. I think that kind of review has to be a part of what we do.\nFEINSTEIN: One more quick question. And I thank you for that.\nThe FBI is in the jurisdiction of this committee as well as the intelligence committee for its work on counterterrorism and intelligence-related activities.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee received last week the answers to questions from one of its open hearings that was held in January of 2007. Now, that's two years to get a response, and we've had to fight to get the response.\nThe FBI regularly tells both this committee and the Intelligence Committee that it can't respond quickly because all information provided to Congress has to be vented through the DOJ, and that causes delays.\nSimilarly, the DOJ prevents the FBI from answering questions from Congress on its domestic intelligence and counterterrorism questions.\nNow, we're not looking to get into the details of an investigation. We are looking to carry out our oversight responsibility. And, therefore, I would like to ask you if you would review this oversight because I think it's been a way to stymied oversight rather than a prompt, quick review which allows the committees to do their work.\nHOLDER: I'll commit to doing that. A two-year response is, obviously, unacceptable.\nI'll work with Director Mueller and the folks in the Justice Department to see if there's a way in which we can decrease that amount of time.\nI mean, two years is simply unacceptable, even -- I don't know exactly what's going. In the Justice Department, we can certainly do better, way better than that.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nThank you, Mr. Leahy.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Thank you for coming back. I know that you have the additional burden as the outgoing chair of the Rules Committee to coordinate the inauguration -- is that correct -- on the 20th. So I know that you've been doing double, triple duty today, as well as taken over Intelligence. So, thank you very much.\nAnd to those who had double and triple duty -- Senator Kyl, of course, is the Assistant Republican Leader for the Senate, and has also been in other committees today.\nSo, Senator Kyl, I appreciate you coming back. I yield to you.\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There seem to be an inordinate number of members of this committee and the finance committee that discussed and talked about the potential for fraud and money- laundering and organized crime. Again, I won't go through all of that.\nBut the question that I'd ask and wanted just to get confirmed for the record is that you indicated that under your leadership the Department of Justice would continue to aggressively enforce the law against the forms of Internet gambling that DOJ considers illegal.\nHOLDER: That's correct, Senator.\nKYL: And then we discussed the regulations that were issued recently, actually, jointly by the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department in consultation with the attorney-general.\nThe regulations primarily try to go at the problem by thwarting the payments for unlawful Internet gambling -- in other words, to shut off the cash flow.\nAnd I mentioned the fact that they were already beginning to spend millions of dollars in an effort to try to undo these regulations somehow and hope that you would -- and you indicated you would -- oppose efforts to modify or to stop those regulations, and, of course, continue to be vigilant in enforcing those regulations to shut off the flow of cash from this illegal activity. Is that your intention?\nHOLDER: Yes, that is my position. That's what I will do.\nKYL: Yes, thank you, and I appreciate that very much. And we could talk a lot more about the pernicious nature of Internet gambling, but in view of the time here, let me move on.\nOne thing we did not talk about, but I understand -- in fact, I know you were asked by Senator Leahy. I forgot who it was -- someone earlier about the liability protection for the telecommunications companies under the FISA Law.\nMy understanding is that you answered the question saying that you would honor the certificate issued by Attorney General Mukasey that allowed the companies to claim the liability protections unless there were compelling circumstances. Is that approximately correct?\nHOLDER: That's, I think, correct, yes.\nKYL: OK. Now, the certification by General Mukasey was based on an investigation of the previous conduct of the telephone communication --telecommunication companies prior to the revisions in the law in order to determine whether they were entitled to receive retroactive immunity. In other words, the lawsuits had been filed based upon their earlier conduct.\nThe new law provides explicitly a protection for conduct prospectively.\nSo, the question, obviously, that arises then is what conceivable compelling circumstances could you conceive of that would relate to this previous investigation that caused General Mukasey to issue the certification?\nHOLDER: Senator, I'm not sure that I can come up with what those compelling circumstances might be. I guess, maybe I was being a little too lawyerly in trying to get myself some wiggle room.\nI can't imagine what set of circumstances there would be that would have us go back and undo those certifications. I can't imagine. I don't know.\nKYL: And you are aware that the Department of Justice, of course, has taken a position in the litigation involving AT&T (NYSE:SBT) (NYSE:T) in support of the liability protections that have been invoked by AT&T?\nHOLDER: Yes. KYL: And it would be quite unusual where constitutional issues are involved for the department just because of a change administration to take a different position.\nHOLDER: Yes, it would certainly not happen as a result of a change in the administration. That would not be a compelling circumstance. And I -- if you...\nKYL: I didn't mean to suggest that either.\nHOLDER: No, no, no. I'm just saying that if you, you know, put me to the task there like, Mr. Holder, tell me what the compelling circumstance might be, I don't think I could answer that question.\nKYL: I hope you'll consider this question not out of bounce. We also discussed the speech you made and you talked about activities before the Congress acted. I had one question to ask in that regard, but we hadn't discussed this.\nYou were deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration when the Department of Justice authorized the warrantless search of Aldred Ames, the spy, who is a US citizen, of course. This was in 1993.\nWere you involved in that authorization by any means or by your recollection?\nHOLDER: I don't remember.\nKYL: Do you have any reason to believe that it was unconstitutional?\nHOLDER: No.\nKYL: Even though it was warrantless?\nHOLDER: No. I was talking to a member of my staff assigned and as I understand it, as I understand what he relayed to me, if there is a national security exception not covered by FISA that would have made that search appropriate, legal, I think.\nKYL: Yes, FISA was not involved.\nHOLDER: Right. I think that is what was relayed to me.\nKYL: OK. Well, my time is up for this round. So, I'll...\nLEAHY: I thank you very much, Senator.\nSenator Feingold?\nFEINGOLD: Thank you.\nAgain, Mr. Holder, among the last minute administrative actions taken by the outgoing attorney general was to approve major changes to the attorney general guidelines governing domestic FBI investigations, changes that went into effect on December 1st.\nAs you may recall, I had a number of other senators on this committee who repeatedly raised concerns about these new guidelines with the way that Congress was supposedly consulted with the decision to push these through during the lame duck period, and also with the substance of the changes.\nWill you take a close look at these new guidelines early in your tenure and consider whether changes need to be made, and will you engage in real consultation with Congress as you do so?\nHOLDER: The guidelines -- I will do that, Senator -- the guidelines are necessary because the FBI's changing its mission, going from a pure investigative agency to one that deals with national security matters.\nI understand the concerns that you have expressed. I think the thing to do would be to see how these guidelines work in operation, but then to take -- ask some serious questions in whether or not the concern that you and others have raised have been borne out by the way in which these things have been used in practice.\nSo, yes, I would commit to doing it.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you. I think these concerns are really quite serious so I appreciate that.\nAnd this is related to -- the FBI has developed a policy document that is hundreds of pages long to implement these new guidelines.\nI asked FBI Director Mueller back in September whether those policies would be made public to the greatest extent possible. He said, \"Yes.\" And I understand from a letter we recently received from the FBI general counsel that a process is underway to consider what portion of those policies can be made public.\nAs attorney general, will you support efforts to make as much of those FBI policies public as possible?\nHOLDER: Yes, I think that helps the FBI, it helps our overall law enforcement efforts to be as transparent as we can, understanding there are certain things that we can not share; but to the extent that we can, we are helped by doing that.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you.\nIn his first state of the union address, President Bush said of racial profiling, it's wrong and we'll end it in America. And not long after that, Representative John Conyers and I introduced the End Racial Profiling Act.\nSenator Barrack Obama was a co-sponsor of the bill in the last two congresses. Will you support the enactment of this or similar legislation to end racial profiling in America?\nHOLDER: I'm not familiar with the bill. I apologize for that but I think that we have to do something to end that practice. It's not good law enforcement.\nYou make assumptions on the basis of the way a person appears and you either put somebody in the ambit of suspicion or you miss somebody because you're looking at that other person. There are a whole variety of reasons why we shouldn't be doing that.\nAnd so, I am against, in every way, racial profiling.\nFEINGOLD: Well, my question was whether you support legislation because there had been some things done by the Justice Department administration in this regard.\nMy question is as to the need for legislation. Do you agree that there's a need for legislation?\nHOLDER: I like to work with you and see what the legislation says and see if there are deficiencies and what the department has done and get a sense -- this not an issue I focused on very recently -- and get a sense of whether or not legislation as opposed to something else might be the better way to do it.\nI'm not saying that I'm opposed to legislation. I think we don't have a factual basis at this point.\nFEINGOLD: Fair enough, I do think there's a strong need for legislation, the law of the land, making it very clear from a legislative -- legal point of view that this is not tolerable.\nOn the death penalty, as you know, in 2000, when you were the deputy attorney general, the Justice Department publicly issued a nearly 400-page report with every conceivable piece of data about federal death-eligible cases down to the district level covering the times since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.\nThis comprehensive report was extremely helpful in understanding how the federal death penalty has been implemented. And in the past two years, I've repeatedly asked Justice Department officials whether they would prepare a similar report covering the time period since 2000.\nAnd while the department provides some statistical information in connection with an oversight hearing held in June 2007, it never agreed to prepare a detailed report similar to the one Attorney General Reno issued.\nWill you commit to making this information publicly availably if you're confirmed just as you and Attorney General Reno did in 2000?\nHOLDER: Yes, that report was done by lawyers in my office and I thought it was a very useful examination of the system and raised some very disturbing questions about not only the racial identity of people who were in the death system -- in the federal death system but also the geographic distribution of those people.\nSo, this is an issue that I think need to be revisited. It's been about, as you say, eight years or so and it might be, I think, an appropriate time to do another study and then share the results as we did in that first study.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you for that.\nAnd finally, I was encouraged by your testimony that DOJ should, quote, \"reinvigorate its efforts to protect the public in areas such as food and drug safety and consumer product safety.\" As you know, private lawsuits play a significant role in protecting the public, but the outgoing administration has pursued a far-reaching policy of trying to pre-empt state court law to a federal regulatory action.\nWhat is you view of this trend towards so-called regulatory pre- emption and do you think the position of the federal government in such case needs to be changed to restore common law legal rights of injured citizens?\nHOLDER: Well, I'm not an expert in that field of the law but I think what we need to do is approach from a pro-consumer perspective. I think we need to always be doing that, protecting the American people; but I think that's especially true now given the economic hardships that so many of our fellow citizens are facing.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Holder.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much.\nSenator Cardin?\nCARDIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, when you are confirmed to be the attorney general of the United States, one of your principal responsibilities is to make sure the access to our legal system is available to all of our citizens.\nLast year, this committee held a hearing on access to civil legal services. We looked at the legal service corporation. The last study was done in 2005 that showed that of those people who are eligible for legal services and applied for legal services, about 50 percent are turned away.\nOver a million cases a year were denied because of lack of resources to have access to our system. That denies justice to the people who could not get those services. When we look at this circumstance, we find that we can do a lot better.\nAnd I guess my question to you is this. Congress should have been appropriating more money. We're at about 50 percent of what we said was the minimum level of appropriations so Congress hasn't provided the money. We haven't re-authorized the Legal Service Corporation for a long time.\nMy question to you is I hope this will become a priority. I understand the difficulty of getting legislation passed in Congress in this area, it's not going to be easy and the jurisdiction rests primarily with the Help Committee. This committee has the responsibility of access to the legal system.\nBut I would hope that we could find a way to bridge this gap, working together with the Department of Justice and take advantage of an opportunity. I know we're in tough economic times and circumstances are even more difficult for people who are seeking help through our legal system.\nHOLDER: Yes, I think one of the responsibilities that the attorney general has, in addition to a few other people, is a systemic responsibility, not only to do the things that concern the Department of Justice directly, but also to take care of a system, a system of justice on the criminal side as well as the civil side.\nI was one the co-chairs of President's Clinton's effort of Lawyers For One America where we try to stress the need for representation in civil matters. The statistics are appalling and consistent with what you say with the number of people, usually poor, and disproportionately women who are not represented in civil proceedings and they're not getting justice as a result of that.\nCARDIN: I want to bring up a matter that you initiated when you were the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and that is Community Prosecution Project, where you worked with the community to get a better of what you're doing, and also a better understanding of the community needs.\nThe goal was to reduce crime, to increase neighborhood safety, and get better cooperation between the community and the prosecutors so that you could be more effective.\nMy question is whether we could use that as a model and try to develop smarter ways that we can involve communities so that we can keep our communities safer.\nHOLDER: I think you need a model and I think that it is something that we should experiment with in other parts of the country. We have seen the success of community policing and it was our thought that community prosecution would also work out.\nI think that we saw positive results from what we tried in Washington D.C., and, we tried it in other places, in demonstration projects. Funding for it didn't continue into the new administration.\nI think it is something that is worthwhile and worthy of looking at and potentially expanding.\nCARDIN: We're working on some legislation with some other members of the committee to try to allow some discretion in setting up these types of programs in other parts of the country. And we urge us to work together and see whether we can get some legislation passed in that area.\nLet me ask just one more question dealing with the Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act. I want to talk about one of the four core requirements, which the deinstitutionalization of status offenders. Status offenders are those who went through into minor issues.\nAnd in the 1980s, we enacted the Valid Court Order Exception, which was supposed to be an exceptional circumstance where you could put a juvenile in a facility in order to protect that juvenile. It was never meant to undermine the purpose of the act to deinstitutionalize status offenders.\nThe number of the use of these orders has increased dramatically over time. I would urge as we look at the re-authorization of this act, to make sure that the core requirements that were intended are now carried out. And we have a realistic schedule so that we can phase out the need for this exception.\nHOLDER: I agree with you, Senator. We don't want to have a situation where we have juvenile status offenders who are made a part of the juvenile system. It does not do them well.\nIt doesn't -- we have limited space in the juvenile system. In any case, we shouldn't be using that space for status offenders. There has to be an alternative way in which we deal with them. And again, it's a question of who we are as a nation.\nWe can be -- we have to be, you know, smart, upfront if we deal with these kids who have these status offense problems in a constructive way. It's much less likely that we'll going to have to deal with them if there are juveniles later on in the system or as adults in the criminal justice system. But it all requires focusing attention on those kids when they're not really in serious trouble.\nCARDIN: Thank you.\nCOBURN: Thank you.\nFirst of all, I'd like to -- a unanimous consent to put into the record evidence of self-defense from gun ownership, various articles.\nLEAHY: No objection.\nCOBURN: Since we only have five minutes, I want to go back to guns just for a minute. Do you have any plans to issue regulations or seek a change in the concealed carry laws of the states or have a federal regulation that might impact those?\nHOLDER: That has not been something that I have discussed with anybody in the administration. It's nothing that I've contemplated.\nCOBURN: It's nothing you're contemplating.\nAnd I understand President-elect Obama does have an opinion on \"assault weapons,\" quote, \"assault weapons.\" Can you tell me what your plans are and how you view that and whether or not you think that may or not be reinstituted?\nHOLDER: Yes.\nI think you had asked me earlier about the regulations that I thought might still exist, post-Heller. And I had mentioned, I think, closing the gun show loophole, the banning of cop-killer bullets and I also think that making the assault weapons ban permanent would be something that would be permitted under Heller, and I also think would be good for my law enforcement perspective.\nCOBURN: OK. Thank you.\nI want to move to just another area that hadn't been covered. I also want to say, I'm still troubled about the FALN decisions with that as I kind of do some moral equivalency with the Oklahoma City Bombing and the people who were in the conspiracy but yet didn't actually commit the acts that took the lives.\nI just have to tell you, I'm still troubled with your viewpoint on that and the fact that you don't believe it was mistaken judgment.\nI want to ask you about the Governor Blagojevich. We have -- and the answer of the questions to the committee, you failed to mention a -- what evidently was a very short-lived and early relationship in doing some legal work for them in December 17th, 2008, in a letter to Senator Specter, you said you'd never did substantive work on Illinois' gaming matter and that the engagement never materialized.\nMr. Chairman, I have a copy of the letter, which I'd like included in the record, if I might. However, in response to a foyer request, the Illinois Gaming Board, it appears that from an April 2nd, 2004 letter that you had at least done enough research to submit a detailed first request for documents from the gaming board and then you had at least one telephone conversation with the chairman of the Illinois Gaming Board.\nAnd I would like this document placed in the record as well, which I will submit. And tell me how that is not substantive work.\nHOLDER: Yes. I was going to say, the letter was drafted by an associate while I work with three capable young men and really only is of preliminary nature. We're asking for very preliminary documents.\nWe did not receive any documents in response to that letter.\nThe call that we had was, again, of a preliminary nature. That was something that we were trying to get things set up in terms of acquiring documents, filling out what our jurisdiction was going to be, figuring out who we were going to report to, dealing with a conflict that existed between the State and my law firm.\nWell, none of those things were ultimately resolved. We never got any of the material that we sought. We were never paid for any of the work that we did.\nAnd that's why we have described it in a way that we did.\nCOBURN: It's a reasonable explanation. Did you all ever send a bill for the hours worked by your associate?\nHOLDER: No, we did not.\nCOBURN: I want to go to one of the things that has troubled me tremendously and that is that we have rules on our veterans who come back who -- and I'm actually asking for a commitment, because we have a rule that says a veteran who is incapable at this time of not handling his affairs is adjudicated mentally defective and cannot own a gun.\nAnd there's no trial that goes through for that. There's no true protection of his rights. And this is not through statute. This is through regulation.\nAnd the current law prohibits individuals who are adjudicated as mentally defective from possessing a firearm and I don't have any problem with that.\nBut by regulation, adjudicated as a mentally defective is defined as a person who is either a danger to himself or others, which I don't have any problem with, or who lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.\nWe have a lot of veterans coming back with closed head injuries who get better, but they ended up losing their rights to go hunting with their kids or their grandfather when they come back.\nDo you believe that this definition that is used in regulation is appropriate?\nHOLDER: I'm not familiar with this area of the law -- of that definition. What you've described though is a bit troubling because I think you're right. People can get well and to the extent that they do, and have an ability, I suppose to demonstrate that they are well, rights then, I think, be perhaps ought to flowed back to them.\nWhat I'd like to do is press work with you on this...\nCOBURN: I'd be happy to send you a letter stating this out much more thoroughly and ask for your opinion in response to that if we could get that.\nHOLDER: But I think you raised an issue that could be a legitimate one.\nLEAHY: Senator Coburn?\nCOBURN: I will yield back.\nLEAHY: Did you have another question?\nCOBURN: Well, I have some, but...\nLEAHY: OK. We're about to go under our -- well, once Senator Whitehouse is over, we're going to go do our third and final round. If you want -- if you have one more question, I'm trying to get flexibility here.\nCOBURN: Actually, I'm doing fine, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: OK.\nCOBURN: Thank you for your graciousness.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Whitehouse?\nWHITEHOUSE: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Holder, I just want to touch on one thing briefly, because there's been so much discussion in this room about whether President Clinton's decision in the FALN matter was reasonable.\nAt the time in the pre-9/11 environment that prevailed then, there was substantial support for this, was there not?\nHOLDER: Yes, there was. The...\nWHITEHOUSE: I'm looking at a list here, which is -- it's described as a partial list of the supporters, and it's 15 pages long.\nAnd if I could just mention some of the names that are on it: Former President Jimmy Carter -- there are 11 members of the United States Congress; there are five members of the New York City Council, which is interesting when you consider that the most grievous offense that the FALN committed was two bombings in 1975 and 1977 in New York; numerous members of the New York Legislature; the former mayor of the City of New York, David Dinkins; a formal resolution, actually, on behalf of the city council of New York.\nFrom the religious community, the United Church of Christ supported this -- and it looks like one, two, three general sign ads so they repeatedly did this. The general conference of the United Methodist Church supported it. The Baptist Peace Fellowship of Northern America supported it.\nBack to New York City again, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church of New York City supported it. The general secretary of the American Baptist Churches of America supported it. The ecumenical officer and president of the Council of Bishops of the African-Methodist Episcopal Church supported it.\nThe Puerto Rican Bishops Conference supported it. The president of the World Council of Churches supported it. The general secretary of the World Council of Churches supported it. The deputy general secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association supported it.\nI count five Nobel Peace Prize Award recipients who supported it; and one Nobel Prize for Medicine recipient who supported it; two organizations that had received the Nobel Peace Prize, Amnesty International and Physicians Against Nuclear Weapons; and two family members of deceased Nobel Peace Prize Winners, including, particularly relevant to all of us, Coretta Scott King of the United States.\nThe president of the National Lawyers Guild -- in fact the National Lawyers Guild, by resolution, supported it. And on and on we go.\nSo, I just wanted to put those names in the record.\nWe can all agree or disagree about this, but I think in context, it's important to recognize some of the leading legal, civil rights, Christian and governmental organizations who were in support at the time.\nThe other thing I wanted to touch on is we had a -- the chairman had a wonderful hearing recently with some of the police chiefs, and there's been a real conflict, I think, between homeland security and hometown security.\nHomeland security has had buckets of money. And people have been able to buy, you know, scuba equipment and underwater vehicles and train up for every possible thing you can think off.\nAll of which is, you know, a good thing but a lot of it has come at the expense of hometown security -- cuts in police coverage, a reductions of community policing.\nI ran a community prosecutors office when I was the Attorney General I'd love to hear you -- and the police officials who were present said that it had become very unbalanced, that in terms of the public safety effect in their own community, the people whose safety they were responsible for, they felt that they had a lot of resources for a very small risk with respect to homeland security and very small resources for a current, present, under the Bush administration, increasing violent crime risk in their communities, and it was extremely disproportionate.\nFrom a sort of policy point of view, how would you propose to address that question? Do you see it as an unbalanced situation right now?\nHOLDER: Well, that's something that I want to work with the committee on and see whether or not if that imbalance exists. I don't want to get on the bad side of my -- our former colleague, Janet Napolitano...\nWHITEHOUSE: That's right. We can't get you in trouble with Janet Napolitano now.\nHOLDER: ... who's the U.S. attorney with the two of us, and, you know, I don't want that to happen. But we really do need to put our money where there is the greatest harm, potential harm. And obviously, defending our nation and keeping our citizen safe is our primary objective.\nBut that has a couple of components to it. We not only have to worry about criminals and terrorists from foreign shores. We also have to worry about criminals who are here and among us.\nAnd we cannot lose the progress we made during the '90s when we worked with you, when you were attorney general in Rhode Island, to see those crime rates really come down. We can't afford to see those crime rates creep back up. We have to do what we can to make sure that we maintain a lid on the crime that restarted in the '90s, but at the same time protect us from terrorists.\nI think we can do both; but it really is a question with the limited amount of money that we have making sure that we're spending it in the appropriate places.\nAnd I would like to work with this committee and with Janet -- Secretary Napolitano, in figuring that out. She and I are going to have a meeting, actually, I think, next week, an informal meeting to talk about those kinds of issues.\nI don't know she'll be as generous as she seemed to indicate in the conversation that we were having when we started talking about actual money, but we'll see.\nBut maybe, as a former colleague, you might help me, Senator Whitehouse.\nWHITEHOUSE: Thank you Mr. Holder.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: I see that these former U.S. attorneys are getting together.\nWell, for those with the schedules, we're going to begin our third and final round.\nI reserve my time for the moment and I will begin with Senator Specter. After we finish this round, this third and final round, we will complete our time with senator -- with Judge Holder and then we will set a time.\nI was going to consult with Senator Specter. Before we do, we'll set a time for the panel tomorrow, which will be the completion of the hearing.\nJudge Holder will not have to come back, obviously, for that. And depending what time we finish tonight, Senator Specter and I will consult and set a time for the morning.\nSenator Specter?\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, I understand you are interested in concluding the night, and I'm agreeable to that, but not if it's going to cut it short on questions.\nYou and I have discussed this for a few moments a minute ago. In the attorney general hearings on Alberto Gonzales, retired chair, Senator Kennedy had a total of 57 minutes. He had two ten-minute rounds. He went into the third round, just 22 minutes, and went to the fourth round, which was 15 minutes.\nAnd so far, there have been 15 minutes -- 10 and 5 -- and you're talking about another 5, but you may extend a little.\nThat is insufficient for the questions I have also for conformation.\nLEAHY: If Senator Kennedy comes back, we'll give him extra time, but the...\nSPECTER: I don't think it's funny, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Well, I...\nSPECTER: I don't think it's funny.\nLEAHY: I know. I was at the Ashcroft -- I have it here -- I was at the Ashcroft hearing, the Gonzales hearing and the Mukasey hearing.\nIn the Mukasey hearing, we only have -- the last hearing we had, we only -- we had two full rounds. The only third round was just you and I.\nIn the Gonzales hearing, there were three rounds, which we're having now. In the Ashcroft hearing, there were two rounds. Only you and I had a third round.\nNow, we're not going to have a different system because it's a Democratic administration than we had with the Republican administration. You're recognized for your third round.\nSPECTER: Well, Senator Leahy, the Gonzales hearing was a republican administration. It's exactly the same thing. And the Republican was chairman of the committee.\nAnd there were requests for more questions and I exceeded. I took on those requests.\nAnd I have other serious important questions to ask, and so do others. I would like to find out from the senators who are here.\nSenator Kyl, how many more questions do you have? How much more time do you need?\nKYL: Thank you, Senator Specter. I yield.\nI would just suggest to the chair. I have several more questions. I'm trying to go through them right now to get it down to the very minimum.\nWe can finish tonight. I have no intention of dragging this out, but I would ask for the same consideration that Democrats were given during the Gonzales hearing, nothing more than that.\nI think if we stopped talking about this and just get on with the questions, we can finish. But we will need a little bit of additional time.\nLEAHY: How much more time do you need, Senator Grassley?\nGRASSLEY: I don't know how to say how much time. I don't think it's -- surely not as much time as I've used. But I do have the issues of congressional oversights, False Claims Act, and whistleblowers that I'd like to discuss with the attorney general.\nLEAHY: Senator Sessions?\nSESSIONS: Well, I thought we're probably going to a third round, and so I had -- I expected to have two more opportunities.\nI didn't expect to finish tonight. Some things I want to work on overnight, but the ranking member -- I know he's been on top of this since the beginning.\nLEAHY: Yes. Just how much time you need it?\nSESSIONS: Fifteen minutes.\nLEAHY: If everybody could, I ask there would be some parameter we could be more precise about.\nSESSIONS: Fifteen minutes.\nLEAHY: OK. Senator Coburn, how much more time do you to finish?\nSPECTER: Well, Mr. Chairman, my suggestion is that you allocate it as a minimum, fifteen minutes more for each senator.\nLEAHY: One senator from Pennsylvania begins his question. Let's see where we're going. A number of questions have been asked two or three times already. We could sit here all night long and ask the same question over and over and over again, which doesn't seem to accomplish anything for anybody.\nI would suggest the senator from Pennsylvania begin his questions. Let's see how we go.\nSPECTER: Mr. Holder, turning to the issue of the quest for independent councils to investigate Vice President Gore on allegations that he had raised hard money from the White House and violations of federal law during the tenure of Attorney General Reno, when you were Deputy Attorney General, there was a strong recommendation by FBI Director Louis Freeh -- Charles LaBella designated by Attorney General Reno to make an independent evaluation as to whether or not there ought to be independent council, and the third attorney, Robert Conrad, who came in for the same purpose.\nAll three of those made strong recommendations for the appointment of independent counsel. There were four witnesses who testified that Vice President Gore was at a meeting where there were discussions about raising hard- money. Lynn Pineda, who was one of the four witnesses said, quote, \"The purpose of the meeting was to make sure that he, Gore, knew what the hell was going on,\" close quote.\nAttorney General Reno discounted the testimony of one witness, David Strauss, who was chief of staff of Vice President Gore, who had a notation of 65 percent soft, 35 percent hard.\nI couldn't remember what was said, but Attorney General Reno did not acknowledge that as competent evidence, which it was, under the hearsay exception of prior recollection recorded which is different from prior recollection refreshed. He didn't qualify for prior recollection refreshed, but he did for prior recollection recorded.\nThere were 13 memoranda from Harold Ickes to the vice president from August of 1995 to July of 1996 containing divisions as to hard money and soft money, also the federal contributions which the equivalent of hard money contributions.\nVice President Gore testified that, quote, \"The subject matter of the memorandums would have already been discussed in his and the president's presence.\"\nThe Vice President further acknowledged that he had, quote, \"had been candidate for 16 years and had a good understanding of a hard- money,\" close quote.\nNow, the applicable law states that where there is a preliminary investigation which determines there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted.\nIt seems to me as it seemed to FBI Director Freeh and Charles LaBella and Robert Conrad that an independent counsel should have been appointed. And independent counsel was not appointed.\nI chaired the subcommittee hearings that rendered this issue in great detail. And it seemed obvious that Vice President Gore was being favored and that if it hadn't been the Vice President, a superior, that independent counsel would have been appointed.\nShould independent counsel have been appointed in that matter?\nHOLDER: No, I don't believe so, Senator Specter. Louis Freeh, Chuck LaBella are very good lawyers, and people who I respect and people who coincidentally are supporting my nomination to be attorney general.\nThere were -- they had their view of that matter. We had career lawyers at the Public Integrity Section who had a time for review.\nAttorney General Reno and I looked at those conflicting recommendations or conflicting views of the case made the determination that we thought that what was expressed by the Public Integrity Section was stronger, was more reflective of both the facts and the existing law, which is not, in anyway, to take away from the Louis Freeh and Chuck LaBella.\nThese are people who are friends of mine, who are great lawyers. And I certainly respect the opinions that they shared with us.\nIn fact, they gave me pause. The fact that we had those kinds of recommendations coming from people that I respected, it made me think twice about where we were going.\nBut ultimately, our determination was that the Public Integrity Section lawyers made the better call.\nLEAHY: Well, the time of the senator from Pennsylvania is expired. Certainly, feel free to continue. I just want to make sure I understood one thing.\nMr. LaBella and Judge Freeh are both supporting you as attorney general, is that correct?\nHOLDER: That's correct. Mr. Freeh, I think, is going to be testifying tomorrow, and both have submitted letters.\nLEAHY: Please, go ahead, Senator.\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, I would appreciate it if my line of questioning was not interrupted.\nHOLDER: I'm sorry, Senator. I didn't...\nSPECTER: You didn't interrupt it. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to him.\nLEAHY: I think the only reason I interrupted is because your time had run out and I was trying to give you a little extra time.\nSPECTER: Well, you could have accomplished that without breaking up collateral matters to interrupt the train of the inquiry.\nThere's no doubt that the chairman would have had other time to make any comments he wanted. He runs the place.\nWere I to understand you to say that you think that was a proper decision, Mr. Holder, not to appoint independent counsel, that if you're confirmed and a similar situation arises, that you would not appoint a special prosecutor?\nWe don't have independent counsel statute, but we have the equivalent of a special prosecutor. You're saying that if you're confirmed, you'll stand by that kind of a judgment?\nHOLDER: I'm saying that I will stand by the judgment that I made then and also assure you and the American people that I'll look at the law, the facts, and make the appropriate determination. And if an independent counsel, a special prosecutor is warranted, I will do that.\nAnd for some perspective, one of the things that people talk about is perhaps we were trying to favor Al Gore. But we certainly didn't favor Al Gore when we decided to make that rescue of Elian Gonzalez in Florida, a critical state as it turned out.\nVice-President Gore criticized the decision to make that -- to do that operation. Maybe that caused him the state. I don't know.\nBut Attorney General Reno and I certainly did not show him any favoritism then and we certainly didn't show him any favoritism with regard to the matter that we are talking about here. Our determination was based really on the facts and the law.\nSPECTER: Well, you have your judgment which you've expressed and you stand by it and I have my judgment. And I don't think it's a closed question.\nI don't think at all -- the basis of that evidence, if it hadn't been the Vice President, if it hadn't been a superior, somebody to favor, if it had been John Doe, an independent council would have been appointed.\nI think it's so clear that it raises a question on my mind as to your fitness for the job, for the record.\nHOLDER: With all due respect, Senator, you're a good lawyer. I'd like to think of myself as a good lawyer. Good lawyers frequently disagree about these kinds of things.\nI don't question your integrity. I respect your opinion in the way that I would hope that you would respect mine. It was not done for any reason other than what I would consider a neutral assessment of the material that we had... SPECTER: You are an excellent lawyer, Mr. Holder. If you weren't such a good lawyer, I wouldn't be so surprised if you were a poor lawyer, an inexperienced lawyer, not a real professional like you say who doesn't know any better.\nBut my evaluation is that a man in your position knew better. That's the whole point, but you've expressed yourself and I've expressed myself.\nHOLDER: Senator, we're getting close to a line here. I will certainly understand a difference of opinion, but you're getting close to questioning my integrity and that is not appropriate.\nThat's not fair. That's not fair, and I will not accept that.\nSPECTER: What's not fair?\nHOLDER: To suggest that the decision that I made in the case along with Attorney General Reno supported by career lawyers from the Public Integrity Section was anything other than a call on the facts and the law. There was never any attempt on the part of any of those people, those career people -- the Attorney General or this Deputy Attorney General to do something that was inappropriate or that favored Vice-President Al Gore.\nThat was not the case.\nSPECTER: Well, you're telling me what you think about it.\nHOLDER: That's fine.\nSPECTER: And I'm telling you what I think about it.\nHOLDER: That's fine.\nSPECTER: And when I look at Marc Rich and the circumstances surrounding that, if you have a part of that guy who's a fugitive with a terrible record and you have Roger Adams calling you at 1 a.m., it looks to me like there's favoritism to cover for President Clinton.\nAnd we talked about FALN, that's inexplicable to me. We went over all the facts as to how you have the professionals opposing clemency, to give you a report, opposed the clemency, then you want them to change their report in order for you to have cover. So I have to make a determination on my vote looking at the totality of your record which, overall, we appreciate.\nMr. Chairman may the records show that it's 5 minutes and 27 seconds, so, I now have the...\nLEAHY: Actually, it's 10 minutes and 31 seconds because it's five minutes plus your five minutes.\nSPECTER: May the record show that it's 25 and a half minutes so that on the Kennedy standard, I only have 21 and a half minutes left.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Senator Feinstein and Senator Grassley, you're on your third and final round and I appreciate the -- Senator Specter wants to make sure you are all given extra time. That's what I'm doing as I did for Senator Specter, and I appreciate you taking only 10 minutes instead of...\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, I'm not finished yet.\nLEAHY: Well, then, finish your questions within a reasonable amount of time. You're now on the third round of five minutes each. You've gone 10 minutes into it. You want more time in your third round because it will not be more than three rounds.\nSPECTER: Mr. Holder, when you came to see me for the so-called courtesy call, I showed you a letter which I had written to you. Attorney General-designate Gonzales and I have written a similar letter to you and handed it to you, but you had a chance to see it at that time and I gave you a notice about it. And this is the parameter and the scope of the congressional oversight.\nAnd the essence of the letter is an inclusion by congressional research report about the scope of appropriate congressional oversight. And it says in part that DOJ consistently obliged to submit the congressional oversight regardless of whether litigation is pending so the Congress is not delayed unduly in investigating misfeasance, malfeasance or maladministration, DOJ or elsewhere.\nIn the majority of events since this review, the testimony of subordinate DOJ employees such as line attorneys and FBI field agents and was taken informally or formally and include the detailed testimony about specific instances of the department's failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases.\nIn all instances, investigating committees were provided with documents respecting open or closed cases that included prosecutorial memoranda, FBI investigative reports, summaries of FBI interviews, memoranda and correspondents prepared during the pendency of cases, confidential instructions outlining the procedures or guidelines to be followed for undercover operations and the surveillance and arrest of suspects and documents presented to grand jury is not protected from disclosure by Rule 6E.\nDo you accept that as an appropriate legal standard for congressional oversight?\nHOLDER: Well, I'd say this, Senator. Congressional oversight of Justice Department activities is obviously very important, but I will respect the Congress' rule. In general, I work to keep the committee fully informed of the department's policies and programs.\nNow, there are limits I think to what we can say about ongoing law enforcement matters, including Grand Jury testimony that might jeopardize an investigation. That would be a concern I would have and also a concern about the impact of revealing that kind of information and the chilling effect it might have on line lawyers. But we'll work to cooperate with you to make sure that you have access to the materials that you need so that the oversight that you conduct would be meaningful.\nSPECTER: Oh, I take that to be a no answer.\nHOLDER: Well, I'm not -- this seems a bit broad to me.\nSPECTER: Well, Mr. Holder, may I suggest and ask that you take a look at it. Study it more fully and give me a response in writing as to whether you would accept that as the appropriate range of congressional oversight or, if you disagree with any part of it, tell me which part you disagree with.\nHOLDER: I'll be glad to do that, Senator.\nSPECTER: Mr. Holder, there had been suggestions for a revival of the so-called Fairness Doctrine, and my question to you is do you think that as a matter of public policy, the so-called Fairness Doctrine ought to be reinstated?\nHOLDER: Senator, that's a toughie. I've not given an awful lot of thought to. If I could perhaps submit an answer to you in writing, I would have an opportunity to think about that. I wouldn't want to commit myself to something and not give you the benefit of what is my best thinking on that.\nSPECTER: Well, this is a subject which I did not take up when we had our so-called courtesy call and so that'd be fine. I will propound some questions to you in writing on that because I want you to answer also the constitutional question if you would.\nHOLDER: Sure, that's fine. You've been very generous in sharing with me both at the meeting and in the address you did on the floor. It was laying out for me, I think, in a very generous fashion the things that I could expect at the hearing and I called to tell you that I appreciated them.\nSPECTER: Senator Leahy asked you about reporters' shield. You said you'd be willing to consider it. We had a reporter held in jail for 85 days on the allegation that a source was not disclosed at all times. The special prosecutor in the case knew where the leak came from.\nI would appreciate it if you would be a little more definitive with your response. I don't want to protract the discussion now.\nHOLDER: Well, that's fine.\nSPECTER: Because I want to give my colleagues plenty of time.\nHOLDER: Well, maybe, let me just say this, Senator. Maybe I wasn't as clear as I could have been. I actually favor such a measure. All I was saying was that I'd want to work on what it actually look like.\nThere's a piece of legislation, I understand, there are going to be concerns, I can tell you I'm sure within the department. I want to work with you on that. But my position is that I think something can be crafted to deal with the issues that you have raised and the concerns I know I'm going to hear at the Justice Department. But I am in favor of the shield though...\nSPECTER: Well, the critical question is a national security issue, right? If you would take a look at that and give me, us, your judgment, I'd appreciate it.\nHOLDER: OK.\nSPECTER: The issue of what was the topic that we started with you and my sense is that there are two fundamental principles involved here. One is the right to counsel, Sixth Amendment, right to counsel, and an integral, indispensable part of that is freedom of communications to a lawyer.\nThe second principle is the state or the commonwealth, which I used to represent. It has the obligation of the burden of proof. And it seems to me that the prosecutor never did try to prove his case out of the mouth of the defendant.\nAnd I don't know if you anticipated where your memorandum would lead, but it has led to some pretty tough situations with the Southern District case, denying counsel fees and finding the district federal judge a violation of the Sixth Amendment rights have upheld by the section.\nI'd like you to respond to that in writing, too...\nHOLDER: Sure.\nSPECTER: ... as opposed to an extensive dialogue here.\nHOLDER: I'd be glad to. But I will note that I think the progress that we made in this area in walking it back from what I think people in the fields have done was largely as a result of the work that you and Chairman Leahy did in expressing concerns about positions the Justice Department was taking.\nBut, frankly, I think we're inconsistent with that initial memo of my mine, so, I'd be glad to respond to the questions that you'll propound to me.\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Holder, for being a patient witness.\nHOLDER: Thank you.\nSPECTER: A witness with a lot of stamina. It's an important attribute for this job. OK. Thank you, Mr. Holder.\nHOLDER: Thank you, sir.\nLEAHY: Are you finished with your questions? This is your last round. So, are you done?\nSPECTER: Yes.\nLEAHY: OK.\nSPECTER: I understood the parameters.\nLEAHY: OK. I just want to make sure you felt you had enough time.\nSPECTER: This is the last tango. We'll ask some more questions in writing, but that's...\nLEAHY: Senator Grassley?\nGRASSLEY: Yes.\nSPECTER: Oh, Mr. Chairman, I want to put into the record unanimous consent...\nLEAHY: Of course.\nSPECTER: ... as a pro-forma matter the whole series of documents and also the editorials without taking the time to enumerate.\nLEAHY: Of course. Of course. Also, we have an enormous number of letters in favor of the nominee. We have some opposed to the nominee. They'd all be put it in the record, too.\nYes, go ahead.\nGRASSLEY: Yes.\nLEAHY: Senator Grassley?\nGRASSLEY: Mr. Holder, when we met several weeks ago -- and I thank you for coming and visiting with me for a long period of time -- I talked to you at length about my congressional oversight efforts and how I take this constitutional responsibility very seriously.\nOversight help makes government more transparent. The taxpayers have a right to know whether taxpayer's money are being appropriately spent. We've got a waste fraud and abuse rampant in any administration.\nIn my opinion, oversight is a particularly important issue for any nominee in your position because of the critical work that your department does and its subordinate law enforcement agencies particularly the FBI.\nSo, I hope you appreciate the role that Congress has in conducting oversight, over the activities of the executive branch including your department. Over the years, I've made congressional oversight a top priority regardless of which political parties is in the White House. I've requested documents, information and access to DOJ personnel for interviews.\nAnd I've learned that oversight works best when the agency fully cooperates to Congress. Unfortunately, agencies are all too often untimely in responding to Congress and in the worst cases, totally unresponsive. This is unacceptable and I hope you agree.\nMr. Holder, I expect that you'll be responsive to my oversight work and that my questions and document request will be taken seriously and answered in a timely and complete way. I hope that I have your assurance that if you're confirmed, you'll assist me with oversight activities, be responsive to my request -- tell me -- make Justice Department as accountable in this coming administration as I've attempted to make it accountable in previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat but the idea is to make it more accountable to the American people.\nThat's an expectation on my part.\nYou can respond if you want to but would you pledge to be responsive to all congressional requests for information and provide this information to Congress in a timely manner?\nAnd before you answer that, I'd like to point out a particular problem that I've had over a period of years, would you work and specifically in your position as attorney general being over everything in the department including the FBI -- would you ensure that responses are not held up due to lengthy, what they call, clearance processes as subordinate agencies such as the FBI?\nHOLDER: Yes, Senator, I will -- in response to this, I guess, the general assertion is to try to do all that we can, and, to make sure that we respond fully.\nAnd in a timely fashion to the very legitimate questions, that, I know, that you have propounded to the department and to the extent that there is a problem with our internal processes, I'll look at those and try to make sure that we make them work better.\nWhat I would hope that we would have is a relationship where, if you're not getting something -- and what you consider a timely fashion, that you will feel free to give me a call, to pick up the phone and say, you know, with regard to subject matter A, I sent this whenever I've not received a response so that you're not upset by our lack of response.\nPlease give me an opportunity to check on the internal workings of the department to make sure that we're doing it as quickly as we can. And if we're not, if I can't give it to you, at least I can give you an explanation.\nGRASSLEY: Then, in that regard, you will remember I gave you a notebook of things that were unanswered and I would hope you'd help us clear those up so that you taking over a department and a new administration have a clear slate. And there is no, you know, six months from now, there is no question, what your responsible for. Or what the previous administration was responsible for.\nOn the issue of whistleblowers, as you've might know or at least I think I've told you, I've been an advocate for whistleblower because I value candid, unflavored information they provide to Congress about the executive branch activities. And quite frankly, most of the time they come to Congress, it's a last resort. They probably don't even know about a whistleblower protection.\nBut they -- something is bad. They tend to be very patriotic people, for the most part. They want government to do just what's right.\nAnyway, many whistleblowers who often come forward, they face tremendous retaliations in agencies.\nAnd that retaliation maybe straightforward as being terminated; could be cloaked as a reassignment or a shifting in duties. Either way, retaliation is exactly why we pass a Whistleblower Protection Act and countless other laws.\nThese laws are a vital tool to ensure that whistleblowers are protected, but oftentimes that doesn't mean that the wrongdoers are disciplined by their agency.\nThis is especially true in law enforcement agencies like the FBI, I've found out.\nSo, you know, I just ask you to take a look at that. Take it seriously. They deserve the same protection in consideration whether an FBI or any place else. A whistleblower who raises concern to many, who'll bring concerns to Congress and cooperate with congressional oversight efforts should be protected, not retaliated against.\nSo, can you give me a commitment that you all do, that you shall not retaliate against Justice Department whistleblowers? And instead work with them to address concerns that they raised?\nWill you commit to ensuring that every whistleblower is treated fairly and that those who retaliate against whistleblowers are held accountable and particularly on that last point?\nThere's so many times, there is injustices has been done. The people that did it to them have never been held accountable, you know.\nHOLDER: Yes, I can make those pledges both to ensure that people are given the opportunity to blow the whistle and they will not be retaliated against, and then, to hold accountable, anybody who would attempt to do that. I've worked with people who, whistleblowers, both in government and more recently in private practice.\nYou know, I've seen their utility, their worth and frankly the amount of money that they return to the federal government. And they serve a very, very useful purpose.\nGRASSLEY: Can you give me, since you've been in government in the past, just as an example. How have you dealt with whistleblowers and in particularly if they didn't agree with maybe a policy or something or a position on a particular matter with you, if you've have ever...\nHOLDER: Yes.\nGRASSLEY: ... or maybe you haven't dealt with whistleblowers.\nHOLDER: No, I have dealt with whistleblowers. I don't think that I've ever dealt with a whistleblower that has had a problem with a particular policy.\nI've not had that kind of interaction with somebody who was complaining about something. The relationships, the interactions that I've had with whistleblowers have generally been pretty positive even as I was saying in the work that I've done in private practice, dealing with the lawyers who are representing the whistleblowers.\nI mean, I try to represent my clients as zealously as I could, but I could understand what they were doing. And I could see the worth to the federal government by the actions that they had taken.\nGRASSLEY: I had a couple other questions here, but I just hope that you would take some sort of positive approach, a statement, or something like that early on in your taking over the department, to make sure that that there's a friendly atmosphere. I mean, I wish a president of the United States previous than this one coming up would have done that because I think that the highest level of government, it would send a signal, you know, that if something is wrong, we want to find out about it.\nAfter all, the public's business ought to be made public and if takes a whistleblower to get it done, do it. I'm not going to ask questions about the False Claims Act, but I think I expressed it to you in my office as author of that legislation, has brought in $20 billion, that maybe wouldn't have been found without people in government knowing about it and bringing cases themselves. Some of them with the help of the Justice Department and it had some problems.\nI've got some legislation -- I'm going to show you that would correct some things that have, in a sense, we get it from our original intent, that I think I've got broad bipartisan support to get passed. And I'd surely appreciate very much your considerations for those, and anything specific I have on falls claims, I'll submit along with a lot of other things for a response in writing.\nBut just so, you know, I think, the False Claims Act, originally in defense and now on health care has been a very, very important tool for us to root out fraudulent use of taxpayer's money and gaining the system for personal benefit, you know. And so, I hope you'll use it. Help people that use it. Move cases forward, you know, things of that nature.\nHOLDER: Yes, I will do that, Senator. You have worked together before on False Claims Act matters and I'll continue to have that level of cooperation with you. You raised good points.\nGRASSLEY: Yes.\nI believe I'm done, totally done, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, and I appreciate you giving that time as I said I've tried to arrange.\nAnd I know that, Senator Kyl, you have some more questions?\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman...\nLEAHY: I appreciate your effort to keep them within eight.\nKYL: I really would have looked down here. Senator Specter raised the question of a compelling testimony for reporters. The Department of Justice guidelines relating to subpoenas for reporters have been around about 28 years, to my knowledge, and they were used when you were at the Department of Justice, were they not?\nHOLDER: Yes, they were.\nKYL: Among the people who have written about this, U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has written, I quote, \"That the Justice Department operates under rigorous regulations restricting the issuance of subpoenas to journalists.\"\nDo you know of any serious problems with the Department of Justice guidelines?\nHOLDER: With regard to the subpoenaing of the reporters?\nKYL: Yes.\nHOLDER: Yes.\nNothing that comes to mind. I don't have...\nKYL: Just so you know, I'm not trying to cut you. This is a very controversial matter and some of us believed that the Department of Justice guidelines have served us very well. I'm not aware of any serious problems with them either. But there are proponents of the legislation who would obviously go beyond them.\nWe received several letters last year form members of the administration expressing concerns. I'm going to boil this down but Attorney General Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence McConnell wrote a couple of those letters. Their abuse letter express, I'm quoting, \"Their serious concerns, especially with regard to the bills effect on our ability to protect the national security and investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of serious crimes.\" That was April of 22nd of last year.\nNow, I'm just going to read one other, slightly longer paragraph.\nThey said, \"We opposed this bill, because it will undermine our ability to protect intelligence sources and methods and could seriously impede national security investigations. Indeed, this bill only encourages and facilitates further degradation of the tools used to protect the nation. We have been joined by the secretary of defense, the secretary of energy, the secretary of homeland security, the secretary of treasury and every senior intelligence community leader in expressing the belief, based on decades of experience that by undermining the investigation and deterrence of unauthorized leaks of national security information to the media. This legislation will gravely damage our ability to protect the nation's security.\"\nI'm not going to go into all of the issues. As I said, I'll boil it down a little bit, but let me ask you about just some that they've raised.\nOne problem they raised, I don't know whether this is inadvertent or not but the bill applies only prospectively. It does not apply to investigations once the harm has occurred so you could get into investigations pre 9/11 but after, on 9/12, you wouldn't be able to require testimony for acts that have already occurred.\nWould you agree that a media shield bill should allow the government to investigate serious on both prospectively and with regard to harm that's already occurred?\nHOLDER: Senator Kyl, you've raised a series of concerns that I think have to be taken seriously. What I was trying to say earlier was that, I think that a bill can be constructed, that would handle or deal with the concerns you have raised and perhaps others that you're going to raise. And still deal with, what I think are, the salutary parts of the legislation.\nThere is a value on -- the concerns you raised are legitimate ones. On the other side, the notion of having a free press and protecting reporters and their sources, I think is something that also has to be put in the mix. I'm not saying that what you're saying is it is not substantial. It must be dealt with the concern about prosecuting people who leak national security matters, the concern about intelligence, all of those things have to be dealt with from my prospective before I would say, sign off on a particular bill.\nWhat I was thinking is that I think the concept is a good one. And I think there is a way which we could find ourselves to a good bill.\nKYL: And I appreciate the Department of Justice guidelines recognized a concept. The question is, whether you go beyond that. I'm just trying to get your view on a few specific matters.\nOne, whether there's should be any difference between a prospective or investigation something -- trying to get information or investigate a terrorist act, for example, that hasn't occurred yet versus investigating one that's already occurred from which, of course, you might get very, get information.\nAs a general proposition, can you think of reason why there should be a distinction between the two? HOLDER: It's one of the problems in the draft of the bill that I believe exists. And General Mukasey and Director McConnell identified as well.\nKYL: OK, I do want to look at that and understand it a little better.\nHOLDER: OK.\nKYL: You've discussed already the need to try to protect, as much as possible, classified information. One of the concerns is the requirement that a media shield bill should deal with classified information in camera. That is to say, if it is going to be involved, at least protect it because it is classified.\nCan you think of any reason why that general principle shouldn't be applied to legislation like this?\nHOLDER: OK. I want to look at the provisions of the bill, understand the concern which sounds like a very legitimate one, the one you've now raised and try to understand why that patch was not included in the bill or I should understand how the bill treats the concern you've just raised.\nKYL: I guess it's safe to say that some of that -- we've been working on specific of this bill for sometime, you haven't, and it is been difficult for you to express a specific -- a view about some of this specific issues that have arisen. That's the reason for your general reluctance to be too specific, correct?\nHOLDER: Yes, that's correct.\nKYL: Let me try just with respect for couple of other general principles. One of the things that General Mukasey and Director McConnell say in their letter is that the bill leaves out -- I'm quoting now, \"Leaves out key non-fissile tools that are essential for protection of national security. The wiretapping provisions of Title III, 10 registered trap and trace authority and national security letters, all of these tools are important,\" they say.\nI mean just as a general proposition, can you think of any reason why they wouldn't be allowed to be used?\nHOLDER: Again, speaking very generally...\nKYL: Excuse me. Why a media shield law would preclude our law enforcement from using those tools?\nHOLDER: Again, not having had the experience with the bill or in this area that you have, I'm not sure if I want to commit myself, but again that sounds like an issue that is very worthy of consideration...\nKYL: Rather than trying to pursue more specific, sir, let me ask you a couple of general questions. Would you work to address the concerns raised in this letter and the other letters that have been written as well as the views -- letters expressing the concerns of the Department of Justice?\nHOLDER: Yes, absolutely. I mean I don't want you to leave here thinking that you have got some press crazy here as potentially Attorney General...\nKYL: I don't believe that at all. I just -- these are really important and...\nHOLDER: They are.\nKYL: ... rear people at the department have really been expressing a lot of views to us. Would you tell us that you will talk, not just to the political appointees but to the career people in the department who really work with these issues for a long time?\nHOLDER: Absolutely. But beyond that, Senator, I want to talk to you and to people who worked on this bill and who might have a contrary view of it. As I said before, I guess in my opening statement, you know, knowledge doesn't reside only in executive branch, the experience that you've had with this, the obvious knowledge that you have of these issues are the kinds of things that I need to be educated about, it may change my mind, frankly.\nKYL: One thing, just in that regard, that'd be very useful. I mean I presume eventually of this legislation is introduced and go somewhere. We'll have a hearing on it.\nAnd I would request and would hope that you'll be willing to testify. Hopefully, your views will have been crystal -- I mean, we shouldn't act on this until you had an opportunity to study it to get your views crystallized and that you would be willing to testify in hearing relating to this subject on such...\nHOLDER: I'd be glad to.\nKYL: I mentioned Secretary Gates' letter. I won't -- it's a separate letter, actually. Actually, he has written two separate letters and without -- I won't go in any of those details. He simply talks about past investigations of unauthorized disclosures that have greatly damaged our national security.\nIt talks about circumstances in which the bill would permit this kind of activity to occur. He says, \"The restrictions -- the limitations to bill remain far too restrictive.\" And he also criticizes the fact that the definition wouldn't extend the protection to at least publicize to individuals who are not even journalists, as that concept is normally understood to quote him in here.\nSecretary Gates will continue to serve in the Obama Administration and I would hope that you would seek his views and address his concerns as well, would you not?\nHOLDER: I'm sure he'll be asking me about this at our next cabinet meeting. Should I be confirmed, they'll be wanting to know, why am I in a fundamentally different place than he is, so. But, I will have that conversation with him. KYL: I'm sorry. I guess I didn't understand the preamble to what you...\nHOLDER: No, I was saying that on the basis of what you've said about the concerns raised by Secretary Gates and should I be confirmed, I might expect to hear from him at the cabinet meeting about, you know, why I was in.\nKYL: OK. Finally, and I don't know. I gathered Director Mueller will be around for awhile, but he too has wait in along with 11 other senior members of intelligence community.\nAnd again, I won't quote from his letter, he expresses strong opposition but I would just ask you to agree to be sure and speak with him about the concerns he has and to try to address the concerns that he specifically talked about national security and foreign intelligence. Would you be willing to do that?\nHOLDER: Yes. I mean, as I said I'd...\nKYL: As we say in deposition, so you need to give an audible answer to the question.\nHOLDER: Thank you.\nKYL: The last question I have on this subject and will be the last question I have for you. I mentioned U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald before. He has written on this and one of the things he noted, and he's exactly right, in my view -- he said \"A threshold question lawmakers should ask is whether reporters will obey the law if it's inactive.\" In other words, if you're trying to do a favor there then that should set out the guidelines by which people conduct themselves.\nThey, meaning lawmakers, should ask because the reporters committee for freedom of the press calls for a share law while urging journalists to defy the law when a court upholds a subpoena for source information.\nSo, here's the solution to it and I'm going to ask if you -- I think this would work.\nHis view is that any shield bill should require that a person seeking its protection first provide the subpoenaed information under seal to the court to be released only if the court orders the information disclosed. That way, the individual gets both the protection of the law but also would -- his part of the bargain is if the court should rule that the law still doesn't apply and he has to disperse the information to the public would, therefore, have the benefit of or not the public but that the law would therefore have the benefit of that information if that's the way the court ruled.\nDo you think it's sensible to have such a requirement in such a bill?\nHOLDER: Well, again I'm not as steep in this as I will be and should be, but it does strike me as somewhat reasonable. But I'd say that with me understanding it, perhaps I would have a chance to just become more familiar with the law, the responsive of that report that you've mentioned and see how that might have an impact on my thinking.\nKYL: There's no reason that you should be a steep in this as some of us who've been working hard for a long time. But certainly it is a very serious matter as all of these individuals have indicated. It will require some attentions on your part and I commend summing your confirmed to you that you begin studying up on this so that should that be consider here that we would have the benefit of your views on that and look forward to conversations with you about how to pose the subject.\nThank you.\nKYL: Thank you, Senator.\nLEAHY: That's it?\nI'm not suggesting that you ask more. I appreciate.\nKYL: I narrowed it down to the best of my ability. It is much more. If I have anything else, I'll ask the question in writing or just it will...\nLEAHY: I appreciate you tying it down like that.\nAnd Senator Sessions, I think you said you have one or two more?\nSESSIONS: I'll say, hopefully. I'll see if I can do better. I can't speak as fast as Senator Kyl though, you know. We, southerners, are a little slow.\nIn an April 2004 speech to the American Constitution Society, a liberal group, you were at -- where you asked the audience what it could do to bring about a liberal renaissance, which is a legitimate political effort to promote your beliefs.\nAnd you singled out the media and criticized them for impeding liberal views and said, and quote, \"In a short term, this will not be an easy task with the main stream media somewhat coward by conservative critiques and the conservative media disseminating the news in anything but a fair and balanced manner.\"\nAnd you know what I mean there. The means to reach the greatest number of people is not easily accessible. So, we do have this discussion of the fairness doctrine.\nDo you think the government has the ability to interject itself in the free market of ideas and direct somehow that there'll be a balance between one view and another view on the airways?\nHOLDER: Well, the views I was expressing there were views that I had, as a private citizen, would not reflect what I would do if I were to confirm as attorney general. What I said in response to the question have been raised earlier about the fairness doctrine was that I just needed to know more about it before I could intelligently response to the question, but I did not mean to implicate the fairness doctrine in that speech.\nSESSIONS: That's important, I think. I just think that's a trail that is deemed to failure for some government bureaucrat trying to state what somebody can say on the public airways.\nAlso before the Constitution Society, you spoke about the Boumediene decision that for the first time granted habeas corpus rights to detainees, prisoners of war or illegal combatants, they were being held at Guantanamo Bay.\nJustice Scalia will note in the sense that, quote, \"It would almost certainly this decision will almost certainly calls more Americans to be killed,\" close quote. You said this, quote, \"The very reason Supreme Court decision by only a five to four vote concerning habeas corpus in Guantanamo is an important first step, but we must go much further,\" close quote.\nI thought that this decision was really a radical departure from the precedent. Never in the history of England, where we inherited habeas corpus rights, or in the United States at prisoners of war ever been given habeas rights; but Supreme Court held that.\nWhat do you mean we must go much further? Do you have ideas that you would like to impose, apparently not required by the constitution but that would further constrict ability to hold those who are at war with United States?\nHOLDER: No, I guess what I said, \"Go further,\" there, that was I think 2004 where I'm not sure -- I think 2004.\nSESSIONS: 2008. That was a June 2008 speech I have asked.\nHOLDER: OK.\nSESSIONS: It would be '04 because the decision was after '04.\nHOLDER: Oh, after Boumediene. OK.\nWell, I'm not sure what I had in mind there other than the concern generally that was expressed throughout the course of that speech about our government making sure that however bad the people where we had in Guantanamo, in the same way, I guess, that Senator Graham had mentioned earlier that these people were treated in a way that was consistent with our values, and so I might have been referring to that. I'm not just sure.\nSESSIONS: Well, I guess in my view as I'm thinking on prisoners of war particularly those who don't comply with the rules of warfare and validate to Geneva Conventions would be given the same rights as an American citizen accused of a crime and it never been done until this decision and we've tried to -- it was based on statutes, I think, rather than the Constitution and we're trying to wrestle with that and maybe make that situation better. Let me ask this. I asked you earlier about your commitment to your statement where you said that you plan to quote, \"Work to strengthen the activities of the federal government that protect the American people from terrorism,\" close quote. You pledged, quote \"To use every available attack to defeat our adversaries.\"\nIn his book, which is a very important book, I think Jack Goldsmith, The Terror Presidency, who, as I said, is in -- been in Department of Justice -- he left the President Bush's Department of Justice. He opposed some of the things that they did, but not all.\nHe described the situation about where the Department of Justice refused to authorize a CIA covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden in 1998 when you were in the Department of Justice as a deputy attorney general. He wrote this quote. \"The White House and justice department lawyers opposed an unrestricted lethal operation against to Bin Laden and would authorize his killing only if it were necessary for self-defense and the course of legitimately attempting to arrest him,\" close quote and that's page 95.\nHe also noted at this time the CIA quote, \"Had Bin Laden in its sights.\" And he discusses how this works.\nAnd what he said was after previous hearings and complaints about covert activities that the CIA and their agents had become a condition to raid their authorizations very carefully and that George Tenet, then CIA director and other managers were insisting that this kind of operations be approved with unambiguous language.\nAnd according to his book, the Office of Legal Counsel that is the Department of Justice's office of legal counsel, agree that the legal pro-evasion against assassinations had not applied to a military target like Bin Laden who posed an imminent threat to United States and who had openly declared war in the United States, I would add.\nSo far so good, Mr. Goldsmith, right? But then the ambiguities appeared. Quote, \"White House and justice department lawyers opposed an unrestricted lethal operation against Bin Laden.\" And that's when he said, \"We only authorized a killing in the course of a legitimate arrest.\"\nAnd part of this whole thing was how agents had become intimidated and fearful of being prosecuted or having their careers ruined for conducting what they think is accurate policy.\nThat's the danger that we deal with. So, I guess my question to you is, to what extent were you involved in those decisions, and is this accurate, and did the White House and other Department of Justice lawyers basically put additional controls on OLC's opinion?\nHOLDER: Senator, I guess, I'm a little disturbed. I read that book and I was a little disturbed to read that portion of the book.\nWell, I'm not at all certain it was appropriate. I don't know. I'm sure you got that cleared. I mean, I don't know. But I'm not very comfortable talking about that operation in this form, in this setting.\nI was certainly aware of it. I didn't have the lead on the Justice Department's role in that. Maybe less transition, I would say that there is clearly a need for people in the field to have clear direction, and we have to be aggressive. We have to understand the nature of the foe that we face.\nNo one should take from any of the statements that I've made today a notion that we're going to retreat from being aggressive and seeking out and getting people before they would get us. I don't mean to say that at all.\nWhat I have said is that I think we can do that in a way that is consistent with or concerned about several liberties. There is not a tension between those two. We can be very aggressive using all the appropriate tools that we have that we would get, that we now have, or additional tools that we might seek from Congress and at the same time, be true to our values.\nI'm not saying that -- so that's what the point that I was trying to make in my earlier testimony.\nSESSIONS: Well, I'm sure that's true, but these are concrete situations and, I guess, it appears from the book that OLC felt there was a legitimate basis. I would just note on his Web site, Bin Laden had declared war on the United States.\nThis is not a normal thug on the streets of Manhattan or something. This is a person who declared war on the United States. And they concluded, this will -- the United States is legitimate in defending itself, but the final decision that came down said that you could only utilize lethal force in the course of an arrest. Did you support that decision or the OLC opinion?\nLEAHY: I'm not trying to stop your answer. Obviously, answer it the way you'd feel pretty part of that.\nBeginning into an area that many of us have been briefed on a very classified nature, and I don't want to put Mr. Holder in a difficult position of having to answer something that may go into a classified area.\nHe, obviously, is used to handle any classified material, and I'll let him make his own judgment. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth at all, but I would just caution senators to be careful in what areas they go into. In having said that, I yield the floor back to Senator Sessions and Mr. Holder.\nHOLDER: Senator, as I said earlier, I'm a little reluctant. I would be glad to answer your question in what I would -- in a more appropriate form. Maybe, I'm being overly cautious here. I don't know. But we are talking about something, I mean, it is out there. That was a covert operation that required the highest level of clearances.\nFrankly, maybe I am free to talk about that now. I don't know. I just -- and I'm just not feeling very comfortable responding to that question yet. But I would be more than glad to find what ability I do have to talk about that, and would be more than glad to share with you with whatever I can.\nSESSIONS: Just one thing, I would like that either in a closed fashion or public if you can do so. Now, I think we need to know that.\nThe problem is that we have created a climate for intelligence agents, the military officers, the law officers who are out serving the country in some very difficult things in which they get ambiguous leadership and then not able to act. And apparently, Bin Laden was in the sights of the United States Government.\nWe were prepared to act, waiting only for legal clearance, and we get back one of these cover-your-rear-end ambiguous things, and the CIA guys, or whoever was involved in this, says they're not acting on it. And I think that is a danger and a weakness that it could leave us more vulnerable than we need to be in the future.\nWith regard to the closed testimony matters, this committee has savaged anybody that it even tried to investigate leaks. The New York Times can print anything, and members of our -- as long as it would embarrass George Bush, and we want to get after, get after anybody that would suggest it was a breach of security.\nSo I'll think it on, but I'll leave this question as it is. I do not want to ask you to say something you should not.\nLEAHY: And Senate Sessions, I appreciate that. I also don't want to get into a debate. We are also going into the whole debate about what happened when we took out troops out of Afghanistan to go into Iraq when they had Bin Laden cornered.\nI mean, these are all debates of mistakes, some mistakes, and maybe not, in the past. I'm more concerned about what would -- what kind of an attorney general, whatever cold it'd be. And the concern's about what he's talking about, what are his plans if he is attorney general, how will he run the department, what is his philosophy, what would he do, because that 's ultimately what 100 senators have to vote on.\nSESSIONS: Well, that's what I'm trying to get at. You've interrupted me and used some of my time. That's what I was getting at. The OLC, what would you do in the future? OLC, according to this, I had felt that it was justified. I think it was justified. Somewhere in the White House, it said that Justice Department lawyers, that you admitted you were -- a preview of these discussions, sent an ambiguous message and it makes me worry about the future. That's what I'm asking you about.\nHOLDER: And all I would say, Senator, is that I agree with you that there has to be -- to the extent possible, unambiguous direction given to our people in the field.\nAnd it means that lawyers have to -- who are involved in that process, have to understand that the words that they use, the direction that they give has to be as precise as possible so that there is not that degree of ambiguity in those directions and -- that would might have somehow end up having an inhibiting influence on the people in the field.\nThey've got to understand what it is they can do, what is this they can't do, and that has to come upon the people who are making those decisions -- the folks, the people at OLC or in other parts of the Justice Department. So I understand. I hear the concern that you express, and I understand that.\nSESSIONS: They, Washington Post said -- ask that Senate Judiciary committee should press you on the rationale for supporting the pardons of that occurred in -- I've asked you a little bit about that previously and we sort of run out of time.\nYou did indicate you thought the president's decision on the FALN was reasonable.\nI was United States attorney for 12 years, assistant to the United States Attorney for two and a half, Attorney General for two. In my opinion, it's not reasonable. It's not close. I mean, that's all I can tell you. And I don't believe it was a close question and it worries me that you say that was a reasonable decision.\nIn one article, a letter by a Deborah Devaney, one of the assistant United States attorneys who prosecuted that case and published in the Wall Street Journal in 1999, writes, quote, \"As one of the FALN prosecutors, I know too much. I know the chilling evidence that convicted the petitioners, the violence and vehemence with which they conspired to wage war on all of us,\" close quote.\nShe goes on to say, quote, \"In the first prosecution, some of the petitioners were captured in the back of a van with weapons use to commit arm robberies.\" And then she goes on to say, \"Yet the President,\" -- perhaps you didn't know your role at that time, \"Yet the president has seen fit to reward these conspirators simply because they were unsuccessful in their murderous attempts.\"\nWell, it goes on. It was opposed by the prosecutors in the case. The pardon attorney, Margaret Love, had rejected it previously. Roger Adams gave you the opinion you wanted in the first paragraph, but didn't spend four pages explaining why this was a very problematic decision. Anyone can read that as his personal objection to it, and I think he conveyed that to you.\nThe FBI director, Mr. Freeh, opposed it and he had labeled FALN one of the three greatest domestic terrorist threats to the United States in 1998. And Mr. Adams did tell you, did he not, the pardon attorney of Mr. Freeh's view on that?\nHOLDER: Yes. I was aware of the FBI's view on that matter.\nSESSIONS: They had killed six people. One of the persons offered the -- on commutation of Senate had planned an elaborate escape attempt using a helicopter and got an extra 15 years for that, which is certainly not excessive for this kind of offender.\nThere were over 130 groups and dozens of people injured, six people killed, and then there was no contrition. The defendants were so unrepentant that two of them -- two of the 16 who were given clemency refused to accept it because they had to promise not to continue to be violent. So, to me, this is really a pretty all gust statement that this was reasonable.\nI would also note that the -- fifteen, it says on my...\nLEAHY: It's five minutes plus 15 on there. For a five-minute run, you're down to 20 minutes, so I was wondering...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSESSION: You asked how much...\nLEAHY: I'm trying to be fair.\nSESSIONS: I know. You asked me how much time, I said 15. I'll wrap up.\nLEAHY: It's a five plus the 15. It shows on here. He has five minutes to begin with. Now, it's 15 minutes beyond that part. It's been 20 minutes.\nSESSIONS: I believe you're right, Mr. Chairman, as usual. I believe you are right. I apologize. I was looking at the time, but incorrectly.\nIn the sentencing commission, there are evaluations of what the sentencing would have been for these people had they've been sentenced under the more recent sentencing guidelines. And without parole, there were 30-year plus sentences, and that's without parole; whereas, these people were sentenced, summed up in one or two at 90.\nTell me again. Was this your personal view that this would be appropriate? And is that what you conveyed to the president?\nHOLDER: I looked at the situation, took into account the fact that these people were not directly involved in incidents that led to death or injuries. I took into account the body of people, I guess, Senator Whitehouse, among -- he mentioned at least a few of them, people who were weighing it in favor of the clemency.\nThe conditions that were put on it, that is they had to renounce violence and some travel restrictions, weighed what the view was in law enforcement, from the U.S. attorneys, from the investigative agencies, and obviously took into consideration what the pardon attorneys were saying, both of them.\nAnd it seems to me that the clemency, it also took into account significantly the length of the sentences that these people had already served, and the sentences that had been imposed by the trial judge, initially a trial judge initially -- it seemed to me that the clemency grant given, taking all that into consideration, was appropriate. And that was what I conveyed to the president.\nSESSIONS: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI do think -- particularly find the rich pardon that you've acquits in and leans toward to be problematic in light of the tremendous controversy this one caused by a year or so before.\nAnd I had to go before hearings, the resolutions of the senate found it deplorable, and I would have hoped that you would have been more forceful with the president on the rich pardon.\nAnd if you had done so, you would have helped protect him and his legacy, which was the smirch about this. Richard Cohen, his ally, has been opposed to your confirmation, because you didn't resist that pardon effectively and it just troubles me.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: I think, I would note, parenthetically, that tens of millions, some would say hundreds of millions of dollars of Republican-controlled Congress went on for six years to try to besmirch President Clinton's reputation in a number of areas.\nI'd also note that I do wish that President Obama had some of the advantages, I mean, than President Bush did when President Clinton left him, than President Bush, the largest surplus in America's history for paying down the national debt and creating enormous number of jobs.\nPresident Obama will inherit the largest deficit of any nation on earth, in history, and the largest deficit and the tripling of the national debt.\nI realized that prior to that cause was all these hearings that might be besmirching President Clinton's decision and legacy. But the fact is, I think of all us, Republicans and Democrats, wish we're inheriting the economic situation that President Clinton left his successor, rather the one that's being left to President Obama.\nI'm not going to take the 20 minutes. Everybody has been taken over their five minutes here, but I'll just cover quick points.\nAm I correct that as deputy attorney general, you had no final decision-making power to grant clemency or pardon? Is that correct?\nHOLDER: That's correct.\nLEAHY: And am I correct that your memo, the FALN, did you remember that the White House made no recommendation of clemency for the prisoners on where they provide analysis with multiple options for each prisoner? Am I correct?\nHOLDER: That's all I've been able to find. If the options memo which lays out the whole pot -- the range of possibilities that the president could consider. But I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I do think that in some formal fashion I conveyed a recommendation to him. I just don't -- well, I can't find it.\nLEAHY: Am I correct that none of the FALN members offered clemency by President Clinton were present when individuals were killed or injured?\nHOLDER: That's correct.\nLEAHY: Am I correct that the prisoners were released under strict supervision of Federal Probation Authorities and none have caused any future harm?\nHOLDER: That is my understanding.\nLEAHY: Am I correct that the clemency offers were conditioned on the prisoners' willingness to renounce violence, and each of them had already served either 16 -- somewhere from 16 to 19 years in prison. Am I correct?\nHOLDER: That's correct.\nAnd two of the -- as Senator Session's noted -- two of the individuals who were offered clemency would not exceed to that demand, that is to renounce violence and they've, therefore, did not get out of prison.\nLEAHY: They stayed in prison?\nHOLDER: They stayed.\nLEAHY: The clemency provided by President Clinton was supported by various members of Congress, numerous religious, Human Rights, labors, Hispanic, civic, community group, including former President Carter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Coretta Scott King, am I correct?\nHOLDER: That's correct.\nLEAHY: Am I also correct that your nomination to be attorney general has been enthusiastically endorsed by the nation's top law enforcement organizations and numerous law enforcement officials, including many who were among the biggest critics of the FALN clemency. Am I correct on that?\nHOLDER: I think the Fraternal Order of Police testified in the hearings that were held and criticized the FALN pardons, and the Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed my nomination.\nLEAHY: And as we put into the record their endorsement of your nomination, and, of course, we'll have, among others, former director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, no shrinking violent when it comes law enforcement matters, who enthusiastically and strongly supports you.\nSenator Coburn?\nCOBURN: Thank you.\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, Senator, we kind of have a little...\nI take a personal privilege there. May I have this two minutes, one minute?\nLEAHY: One.\nSESSIONS: One minute.\nLEAHY: Start the clock.\nSESSIONS: I think it is true that President Clinton did sight your recommendation in his later basis for granting the pardon on number one...\nLEAHY: Which part is that, Senator?\nSESSIONS: The FALN. No, Marc Rich...\nLEAHY: Rich's pardon, yes.\nHOLDER: That's right. Excuse me.\nSESSIONS: And Osama Bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad weren't directly involved in the murders. They were conspirators to that, and they probably and morally are more accountable in my view and equally co-accountable as those who actually carried out the attacks in the United States. Wouldn't you agree?\nHOLDER: I would, but the FALN people are not in the same category as Khalid Sheikh Mohammad or Bin Laden in that they were not the heads of the organization. That is not my understanding of the people who were with the, part of risk.\nAgain, I want to emphasize, these people were criminals. They were terrorists. I'm not giving them a pass. They served substantial amounts of time. And I want anybody...\nSESSIONS: You recommend it against the law enforcement people that they not serve the full time when they were sentenced, and they wouldn't even file papers. I don't think any of them actually even asked for a pardon. They were hardcore about it. Excuse me. OK, my time is up.\nLEAHY: Senators, five minutes has gone to 24 minutes.\nSenator Coburn?\nCOBURN: Thank you. And I promise not to take 24 minutes.\nFirst of all, I'm sorry you...\nLEAHY: I'm going to need a doctor if you do.\nCOBURN: And I know the Chairman wants to get home to his grandchildren and I know you all would like a break and have a dinner, so I'm going to be very short.\nThree points for the record. One, the only thing I would say about the FALN is that clemency was granted after the Oklahoma City bombings. And so, there is a lack of sensitivity there. It wasn't to the same degree, but the intent was.\nNumber two, as far as the comments by my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, your soon-to-be boss when you're sworn-in as attorney general made great efforts on Homeland Security committee to take away the parochialism of the Homeland Security grants. And only three members of this committee voted with you to make it on the basis of risk instead on the basis of parochialism.\nSo, I hope you'll look at that as you see this necessity of trying to rearrange the money that you have in terms of looking at risk instead of parochialism that makes us all look good.\nI want to get you on record. We talked about this in the office. Your boss and I passed a bill called the Transparency and Accountability Act. It requires the submission of where you spend your money, the contracts, sub-contracts, the grants and the sub- grants. Is your intention to comply with that on a timely basis so the American people can see that?\nHOLDER: Yes.\nCOBURN: Thank you.\nAnd then my last question about guns. Promise, I'll never ask you another one in the committee hearing. And all I want is a yes or no, because I think people need to hear where you're going on this. There's some uneasiness among the second amendment crowd in this country, and what I'm trying to do is clarify that.\nWill you commit to protect and preserve the rights of those 40 states that have a -right-to-carry law by opposing legislation that would encroach upon those rights?\nHOLDER: In the opposing state legislation? I'm not...\nCOBURN: No, opposing federal legislation that would encroach upon those rights.\nLet me say it again.\nHOLDER: Yes, I understand the question. I'm just not sure how -- what the appropriate role would be for the federal government in the situation that you described. I don't...\nCOBURN: Well, if we're passing a law, that's obviously going to do that as the supreme enforcer of the law in this land. As the head law enforcer, it should be upon you to challenge that and accord when it, obviously, is going to violate the Heller decision.\nSo, what I'm asking you is to specifically state that if we pass something that violates these state laws, in other words, are going to limit these state laws, take away second amendment rights as being defined by the Heller decision, will you in fact intercede on the basis of that Heller decision to defend the rights of the state to have carry laws?\nHOLDER: Well, I wouldn't support any law that violated the dictates of Heller.\nNow, I don't know -- the question you asked is hypothetical. It's hard to answer hypotheticals without having all of the facts. But I will state, as I said, I think earlier, Heller is the law of the land. It has to be taken into account with regard to any legislation that might be considered.\nCOBURN: Well, let me just pin you down just a little bit closer so I can get comfortable.\nHOLDER: OK.\nCOBURN: Do you believe the states presently have the right to establish carry laws in the states?\nHOLDER: I think...\nCOBURN: Either concealed carry, or not concealed carry law.\nHOLDER: Without agreeing or disagreeing with them, I think states do have those rights.\nCOBURN: Yes, the states do have. Will you work to protect that the states will continue to have that right?\nHOLDER: Senator, yes, I guess -- I mean, in favor...\nCOBURN: You're making my second amendment crowd really nervous. They want to hear you say, \"Yes, they have that right and they ought to be able to maintain that right.\" That's what they want to hear you say.\nHOLDER: And I guess what I'm saying to that same crowd is that I have no intention -- this administration has no intention of doing anything that would affect a states regulation of firearms, who can carry a firearm, under what circumstances. There is nothing that we have discussed, nothing that is in planning, nothing that I can imagine that we're going to be doing in that regard, so.\nLEAHY: Well, if the Senator yields to me.\nCOBURN: I'd be happy to.\nLEAHY: Just to ask for a clarification. The State of Vermont has very simple laws on guns. During hunting season, deer hunting season, and your semi-automatic are restricted to a certain number of rounds to give the deer a chance.\nWe post signs outside the limits, city limits of Montpelier, our state capital, saying that if you're going to hunt deer inside the city limits of Montpelier like for example, crossing the Statehouse Lawn or something, you are limited to shotguns. That's the only place you are.\nAnybody, unless they are a felon are allowed to carry a loaded concealed weapon above the certain age without a permit. Nobody does. We like the fact that we can. The vast majority of us in Vermont like myself, own numerous firearms.\nDo I understand you to say you're not going to be on a crusade to have the federal government come in and override the laws of the State of Vermont?\nHOLDER: That would be true. I've made and I express...\nLEAHY: They are a lot less restricted than laws of Senator Coburn's state.\nHOLDER: Maybe I've not expressed this well, but this is not an agenda item. It's not a focus. It's not an expectation that I have for this administration. I'm not sure how I can say it any plainer than that.\nThere are things that we want to do with regard to crime prevention and to reduce crime. But the concern that you have raised is not on any of the menu items that I have seen or could imagine.\nCOBURN: Thank you for your answers. It's not the one I wanted to hear, but thank you for the answer.\nMr. Chairman, we will submit additional questions, and thank you for being patient.\nAnd thank you, Mr. Holder, for the fine job you've done today.\nHOLDER: Thank you, Senator.\nLEAHY: We will -- the witness is dismissed with our thanks.\nHOLDER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: And with me, you're dismissed with my admiration and my gratitude.\nHOLDER: Thank you very much. I think I've been very...\nLEAHY: I'm very clear I'm going to vote for you. We'll reconvene tomorrow morning with the panel at 10 o'clock in the Senate Judiciary committee hearing. With that, we stand recess.\nHOLDER: Thank you, Senator.", "timestamp": "2009-01-15", "title": "Senate Confirmation Hearing for Attorney General Nominee Eric Holder: Day One"}

And thank you for having the wisdom and foresight to invite Lindsey Graham, because there -- these two represent, in their respective parties, as smart and as dedicated a pair of public officials as we have.\nAnd, Joe, I drafted as vice president. But Lindsey Graham, I'm drafting as one of our counselors in dealing with foreign policy because the fact is, as our tradition has always been, that our differences end at the water's edge and that at a certain point it is imperative for us to have a clear, coherent strategy at home, so that the young men and women who are day to day engaged in extraordinary -- extraordinarily difficult, you know, deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, that they are well served.\nAnd so, the trip that both of you took and the recommendations that you're going to be delivering to me are going to be of enormous help in making sure that we do what is my number-one task as president-elect and as president, and that is to keep the American people safe and to make sure that when we deploy our military, that we do so with a clear sense of mission and with strong support from the American people.\nAnd I think the trip that you've taken helps us move in that direction.\nSo, with that, I'm going to take...\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: One comment that I want to make (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yes?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Every place we went, we visited our troops.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Every place, the degree of enthusiasm and well wishes for you personally were -- I have been there a lot -- were spontaneous. So they're wishing you well, man, and they're looking forward to you being commander in chief. And it really was -- it was heartening to see.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, that's wonderful.\nQUESTION: Sir, just a quick question, going back to Capitol Hill: Are you concerned that Timothy Geithner's taxes mishap will affect his chances of confirmation and, if he is confirmed, will affect his credibility?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: No. Tim Geithner when I nominate him was right -- rightly lauded by people from both sides of the aisle, from the market, from labor as somebody who is uniquely qualified to deal with, as what Lindsey described properly as the biggest crisis that we've had since the Great Depression.\nYou know, look, is this an embarrassment for him? Yes. He said so himself. But it was an innocent mistake. It is a mistake that is commonly made for people who are working internationally or for international institutions. It has been corrected. He paid penalties.\nAnd as I have said before, if my criteria, whether it was for Cabinet secretary or vice presidents or presidents or reporters was that you'd never made a mistake in your life, none of us would be employed.\nSo my expectation is that Tim Geithner will be confirmed. And my expectation is, is that he is going to do an outstanding job on part -- on part of the -- on behalf of the American people.\nSTAFF: Last question.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Lindsey, you want to add...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Just speaking as a single -- as one Republican, I couldn't agree more. These are huge times. It's not -- now is not the time to think in small political terms.\nHe has a great resume. He's been involved with Secretary Paulson. He knows the past. I think he can help fashion the future.\nSo the problems that we talked about, I think, have been dealt with responsibly, and I don't see any desire by the Republican Party to play gotcha on something like this.\nWe need -- we need a new secretary of treasury that understands where this country's at financially and has a game plan to move forward. I think he's the right guy.\nSTAFF: Mr. President-elect...\n(CROSSTALK)\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'm sorry. I think we had interrupted her question.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nMr. Vice President-elect, first of all, what was the update on Osama bin Laden (inaudible)?\nAlso, Mr. President-elect, new tapes have surfaced from Osama bin Laden. What are your thoughts about those tapes? And what are your efforts moving into your new administration (inaudible)?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yes, I'm going to take the question first, and then, Joe, if you want to add something.\nBut I have been assiduous about this, I have been consistent about this, that we have one president at a time when it comes to foreign policy. And so I don't want to get too far afield in terms of what our -- our policies are going to be.\nI can refer back to what I said during the campaign and the fact that I haven't changed my mind, that bin Laden and al Qaeda are our number one threat when it comes to American security, and this administration, working in concert with Congress, with Republicans and with the American people, we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that they cannot create safe havens they can attack America. That's the bottom line.\nNow, as Joe indicated, we have to take a regional approach. We're not going to solve the problem just in Afghanistan; we're going to have address issues in Pakistan as well.", "timestamp": "2009-01-14", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect on Tim Geithner and the Vice President-Elect's Trip to Afghanistan"}

But I also know that it hasn't always been easy for you and Mom, and that as excited as you both are about that new puppy, it doesn't make up for all the time we've been apart. I know how much I've missed these past two years, and today I want to tell you a little more about why I decided to take our family on this journey.\nWhen I was a young man, I thought life was all about me-about how I'd make my way in the world, become successful, and get the things I want. But then the two of you came into my world with all your curiosity and mischief and those smiles that never fail to fill my heart and light up my day. And suddenly, all my big plans for myself didn't seem so important anymore. I soon found that the greatest joy in my life was the joy I saw in yours. And I realized that my own life wouldn't count for much unless I was able to ensure that you had every opportunity for happiness and fulfillment in yours. In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation.\nI want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential-schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college-even if their parents aren't rich. And I want them to get good jobs: jobs that pay well and give them benefits like health care, jobs that let them spend time with their own kids and retire with dignity.\nI want us to push the boundaries of discovery so that you'll live to see new technologies and inventions that improve our lives and make our planet cleaner and safer. And I want us to push our own human boundaries to reach beyond the divides of race and region, gender and religion that keep us from seeing the best in each other.\nSometimes we have to send our young men and women into war and other dangerous situations to protect our country-but when we do, I want to make sure that it is only for a very good reason, that we try our best to settle our differences with others peacefully, and that we do everything possible to keep our servicemen and women safe. And I want every child to understand that the blessings these brave Americans fight for are not free-that with the great privilege of being a citizen of this nation comes great responsibility.\nThat was the lesson your grandmother tried to teach me when I was your age, reading me the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence and telling me about the men and women who marched for equality because they believed those words put to paper two centuries ago should mean something.\nShe helped me understand that America is great not because it is perfect but because it can always be made better-and that the unfinished work of perfecting our union falls to each of us. It's a charge we pass on to our children, coming closer with each new generation to what we know America should be.\nI hope both of you will take up that work, righting the wrongs that you see and working to give others the chances you've had. Not just because you have an obligation to give something back to this country that has given our family so much-although you do have that obligation. But because you have an obligation to yourself. Because it is only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.\nThese are the things I want for you-to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world. And I want every child to have the same chances to learn and dream and grow and thrive that you girls have. That's why I've taken our family on this great adventure.\nI am so proud of both of you. I love you more than you can ever know. And I am grateful every day for your patience, poise, grace, and humor as we prepare to start our new life together in the White House.\nLove, Dad", "timestamp": "2009-01-14", "title": "Open Letter from the President-Elect to His Daughters"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85454", "text": "KERRY: Well, good morning, everyone. We welcome you all here. We're delighted to welcome Senator Clinton, secretary of state designate. I think every member of the committee believes very strongly that in Senator Clinton we have a nominee who is extraordinarily capable and smart, an individual with the global stature and influence to help shape events.\nShe will take office on a first-name basis with numerous heads of state, but also with billions of people in every corner of the globe, those billions of people that the Obama administration hopes to reach, inspire, and influence. Her presence overseas will send a strong signal immediately that America is back.\nThis morning, we look forward to a good, healthy dialogue, and, over the coming years, we particularly look forward to a strong, close, cooperative, working relationship.\nThis is an historic moment for this committee. For the first time in American history, one of our members will be sworn in as president and another one as vice president. Before any of the newer members of our committee get too excited about future prospects, let Dick Lugar, Chris Dodd, and myself -- and perhaps even Hillary will join in this -- in saying trust us, it ain't automatic.\n(LAUGHTER)\nFor me, it is a particularly special and personal privilege to be sitting here, having testified before Chairman Fulbright in 1971 and having worked closely with the chairmen since who have set a strong example for this committee's ability to contribute to our security.\nAnd this morning, we should remember one chairman in particular. Last week, Dick Chris, Sheldon, and I attended memorial services for Claiborne Pell in Rhode Island. President Clinton, who first met Chairman Pell when he was a college student interning on this committee, spoke movingly at the funeral. And today, I know we all join together in expressing our gratitude for Chairman Pell's exemplary service. His commitment to bipartisanship and multilateralism remains the guidepost by which this committee will continue its efforts.\nI'm privileged also to follow in the more recent footsteps of two respected chairmen and good friends. Vice President-elect Biden and I first ran for office together in 1972, and we grew up together in politics. I know Joe and his family well, as many of the members of this committee do. I value his friendship, and the country will come to value the wisdom and strength which he brings to the vice presidency. The committee is grateful for his leadership.\nI also have the good fortune as chairman to have beside me as ranking member the senior-most Republican in the Senate, a Noble Peace Prize nominee for his groundbreaking nonproliferation work and a trusted, thoughtful voice in our national security dialogue.\nSenator Lugar, I look forward to working with you in the same cooperative way that Senator Biden did and others have in the past, and I know that that will characterize the work of this committee as we go forward, and I could not have a better partner, and I thank you for that.\nIf we do our job correctly, as we begin a new presidency and a new Congress, we stand on the brink of a new era of American diplomacy with great potential for significant, if not transformational, steps forward across the globe, and I look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to seize that potential.\nIn the last seven years, we have spent the treasure of our nation -- young American soldiers, first and foremost, and billions of dollars -- to fight terrorism, and yet grave questions remain as to whether or not we have chosen our battles correctly, pursued the right strategy, defined the right goals.\nThat we are engaged in fighting a global insurgency is beyond doubt, but our task is to define the method and means of our response more effectively, and no challenge will be greater in the days ahead than to get this right.\nPakistan and Afghanistan are definitively the front line of our global counterterrorism efforts. Having visited several times recently, it is clear that no amount of additional troops will succeed absent the effective instruments of a functioning state. We face a gargantuan task, and to be successful, I believe we must fundamentally redefine our approach.\nWe went into Afghanistan to deny Al Qaida sanctuary. Our goals must be defined by our original mission, by the regional security context, and by the tribal decentralized nature of Afghan society. I'm eager to hear Senator Clinton's thoughts on the road ahead in Afghanistan.\nNor should anyone believe that Iraq is a completed task. Despite the Status of Forces Agreement that sets out a schedule for reduction of U.S. forces, Sunni and Shia tensions, the unresolved status of Kirkuk, the distribution of oil revenues, and setbacks to political reconciliation each threaten to upend our fragile progress, and they will require active diplomatic engagement by Secretary of State Clinton and the rest of the Obama administration with Iraq's government and particularly with its neighbors.\nIraq, as well as Iran, Syria, the West Bank, and Gaza, all require an approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of each of these challenges. We look forward to working with the administration and the Secretary Clinton on a significantly expanded and vigorous diplomatic effort.\nIn the age of catastrophic terrorism, it is also urgent -- and I know Senator Lugar joins me in expressing this -- urgent that we restore America's leadership on nonproliferation. Whatever our differences, we must reengage with Russia on nuclear security, specifically the START Treaty.\nIt is my hope that we will embrace deep reciprocal cuts in our nuclear arsenals, and I'm eager to hear Senator Clinton's thoughts on this matter. Consistent with our security needs, I believe we should set a goal of no more than 1,000 deployed warheads, and that goal should be just the beginning. We should also lay the groundwork for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\nThe last eight years have resulted in increased suspicion of our motives abroad, especially in the Muslim world where we must do much more to reduce the prevalent and costly perception of an assault on Islam. It is vital that we redouble our efforts to find common ground, including through interfaith dialogue.\nKERRY: We must integrate all of the disparate elements of our national power into a single unified effort, and I agree with Secretary Gates that we need a State Department with more resources and greater capacity to deal with 21st-century challenges in conflict zones and in weak and failing states.\nI was heartened to hear Senator Clinton signal her desire to radically improve our diplomatic capacity and finally give the State Department the tools it needs to put civilian functions back in civilian hands, and she can count on our support in that effort.\nShe can also count on our support in efforts to reengage with Latin America and recognize how crucial renewed and expanded relationships with Russia and China are to our overall goals. I believe, Madam Secretary-designate, that China offers us extremely important opportunities for a more productive partnership, and we need to approach that relationship with greater respect for and understanding of our common interests.\nBefore turning to Senator Lugar, let me just say one thing about global climate change. Many today do not see global climate change as a national security threat, but it is profoundly so. And the consequences of our inaction grow more serious by the day.\nIn Copenhagen this December, we have a chance to forge a treaty that will profoundly affect the conditions of life on our planet itself. A resounding message from the recent Climate Change Conference in Poland was that the global community is looking overwhelmingly to our leadership. This committee will be deeply involved in crafting a solution that the world can agree to and that the Senate can ratify, and, as we proceed, the lesson of Kyoto must remain clear in our minds: All countries must be part of the solution.\nEach of these challenges present major opportunities for a new administration and for a new secretary of state. After the polarization of the last eight years, diplomacy must be directed domestically as well. Senator Clinton's record in the Senate shows her to be an alliance builder in the finest traditions of this body. She has repeatedly sought out the best people, the best ideas, and the common ground upon which solutions could be found.\nKERRY: While the committee still has some questions with respect to the fund-raising activities of the Clinton Foundation, I'm pleased that Senator Clinton will have an opportunity today to address them beyond the ways in depth that they have already been addressed.\nI understand that Senator Lugar will be speaking to this issue in greater detail, and we look forward to hearing the senator's responses.\nLet me just say personally that in the year 2000, I had the privilege of joining the then first lady and her husband on the first visit by an American president to Viet Nam after the normalization of relations.\nI've seen Senator Clinton's diplomatic acumen up close. I saw her immense curiosity, her quick and impressive grasp of detail, and her authoritative approach, all of which will serve her will in this new undertaking.\nHillary Clinton has shown the intelligence to navigate the complex issues that we face, the toughness and the tireless work ethic that this job will require, the stature to project America's world leadership, and the alliance building -- at home and abroad -- that will be vital to our success in the years ahead.\nAs senator, Hillary has earned the respect of her colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, and we are honored to welcome her here today to our committee for confirmation as America's next secretary of state.\nSenator Lugar?\nLUGAR: Mr. Chairman, I congratulate you on taking the gavel and wish you every success. And we appreciate the very gracious comments you have made about previous chairmen. And I join you especially in your tribute to our former colleague Senator Pell, whose life we celebrated together last week.\nIt's a great pleasure to welcome Senator Hillary Clinton to the Foreign Relations Committee. Those of you who have served with her during the past eight years can attest to her impressive skills, her compassion, her collegiality. I've enjoyed the opportunity to work with her in the Senate. I look forward to the prospect of much more frequent collaboration when she is secretary of state.\nI also want to congratulate Senator Kerry on the assumption of chairmanship of this committee. My first hearing as chairman of the committee in 1985 was one of the proudest moments of my career. And I'm sure Senator Kerry is feeling the gravity as well as the joy of this historic occasion.\nAnd I want to thank him and his staff for their graciousness during the last several weeks. It's been a pleasure to work with them. And I look forward to all that we can achieve together under Senator Kerry's chairmanship.\nI've frequently said the foremost criteria for selecting a national security cabinet official should be whether the nominee is a big leaguer who has achieved extraordinary accomplishments, is well known to the world, understands both process and policy, and can command global respect.\nIn Senator Clinton, President-elect Obama has boldly chosen the epitome of a big leaguer. Her qualifications for the post are remarkable. Her presence at the helm of the State Department could open unique opportunities for United States diplomacy and could bolster efforts to improve foreign attitudes toward the United States. She has a long-standing relationship with many world leaders that could be put to great use in the service of our country.\nHer time in the Senate has given her a deep understanding of how United States foreign policy can be enriched by establishing a closer relationship between the executive and legislative branches. She is fully prepared to engage the world on a myriad of issues that urgently require attention.\nDuring the last six years, this committee has held more hearings than any other committee in the Senate, and we have tried to come to grips with issues involving Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Russia, the Middle East peace process, Africa, the Western Hemisphere, the NATO Alliance, non-proliferation, foreign assistance reform, the State Department budget, and numerous other priorities.\nAll of these challenges will continue to occupy Senator Clinton as secretary of state. I would highlight several other points to which I hope the secretary will very high priority in addition to the ongoing crises that will press for her attention.\nFirst, it is vital that the START Treaty with Russia be renewed. When the Senate gave its consent to ratification to the Moscow Treaty in 2002, it did so knowing that the United States could rely on START Treaty's verification regime. It provides important assurances to both sides.\nAt the time, this committee was assured that extension of START was a very high priority. Unfortunately, little progress has been made, and the treaty will expire in 11 months.\nIn other words, the conceptual underpinning of our strategic relationship with Russia depends upon something that is about to expire. Such an outcome will be seen as weakening the international nonproliferation regime. Second, energy security must be given a much higher priority in our diplomacy. Earlier this month, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered a cutoff in natural gas supplies that struck allies across Europe. And this dispute is only the most recent example of how energy vulnerability constrains our foreign policy options around the world, limiting effectiveness in some cases and forcing our hand in others.\nI look forward to supporting President-elect Obama in taking the necessary steps to dramatically reduce our domestic dependence on oil. Yet domestic reform alone will not be sufficient to meet the global threats to our national security, our economic health or climate change.\nIn my judgment, energy security must be at the top of our agenda with nearly every country. Progress will require personal engagement by the secretary of state.\nThird, eradicating global hunger must be embraced as both a humanitarian and national security imperative. Precipitous food price increases that occurred in 2007 and 2008 created havoc in many parts of the world, causing riots in some 19 countries and plunging an additional 75 million people into poverty and increased vulnerability to malnourishment.\nNearly 1 billion people are presently food insecure. It is predicted the world's population will grow to such an extent that by 2050 current food production will need to double in order to meet demand. There is no reason why people should be hungry when we have the knowledge, the technology and the resources to make everyone food secure.\nThe United States is uniquely situated to help the world feed itself and has the opportunities to recast its image by making the eradication of hunger a centerpiece of United States foreign policy.\nLUGAR: And with these issues in mind, it's especially important we move forward with Senator Clinton's nomination. President-elect Obama has expressed his confidence in her, and he deserves to have his secretary of state in place at the earliest opportunity.\nThe main issue related to Senator Clinton's nomination that has occupied the committee has been the review of how her service as secretary of state can be reconciled with the sweeping global activities of President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.\nTo this end, the Obama transition and the Clinton Foundation completed a memorandum of understanding outlining steps designed to minimize potential conflicts of interest.\nI share the president-elect's view that the activities of the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton himself should not be a barrier to Senator Clinton's service. But I also share the view implicitly recognized by the memorandum of understanding that the work of the Clinton Foundation is a unique complication that will have to be managed with great care and transparency.\nThe core of the problem is that foreign governments and entities may perceive the Clinton Foundation as a means to gain favor with the secretary of state. Although neither Senator Clinton nor President Clinton has a personal financial stake in the foundation, obviously its work benefits their legacy and their public service priorities.\nThere is nothing wrong with this, and President Clinton is deservedly proud of the Clinton Foundation's good work in addressing HIV/AIDS, global poverty, climate change, and other pressing problems.\nBut the Clinton Foundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it could curry favor through a donation. It also sets up potential perception problems with any action taken by the secretary of state in relation to foreign givers or their countries.\nThe nature of the secretary of state post makes recusal from specific policy decisions almost impossible, since even localized U.S. foreign policy activities can ripple across countries and continents. Every new foreign donation that is accepted by the foundation comes with the risk it will be connected in the global media to a proximate State Department policy or decision.\nForeign perceptions are incredibly important to United States foreign policy, and mistaken impressions or suspicions can deeply affect the actions of foreign governments toward the United States. Moreover, we do not want our own government's deliberations distracted by avoidable controversies played out in the media.\nThe bottom line is that even well-intentioned foreign donations carry risks for United States foreign policy. The only certain way to eliminate this risk going forward is for the Clinton foundation to forswear new foreign contributions when Senator Clinton becomes secretary of state.\nI recommend this straightforward approach as the course most likely to avoid pitfalls that could disrupt United States foreign policy or inhibit Senator Clinton's own activities as secretary of state.\nAlternatively, the Clinton Foundation and the Obama transition have worked in good faith to construct a more complex approach based on disclosure and ethics reviews that would allow the foundation the prospect of continuing to accept foreign donations deemed not to have the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nThe agreement requires, among other measures, the disclosure of all the foundation donors up to this point and annual disclosure of donations going forward and a State Department ethics review process that would evaluate proposed donations from foreign governments and governmental entities.\nAll of these are positive steps. But we should be clear that this agreement is a beginning and not an end. It is not a guarantee against conflict of interest or its appearance. And for the agreement to succeed, the parties must make the integrity of United States foreign policy their first principle of implementation.\nFor this reason, the requirements for transparency in the memorandum of understanding should be considered a minimum standard. I'm hopeful the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration will go further to ensure that the vital business of United States foreign policy upon which the security of our country rests is not encumbered by perceptions arising from donations to the foundation.\nIf there is a slightest doubt about the appearance that a donation might create, the foundation should not take that donation. If there are issues about how a donation should be disclosed, the issue should be resolved by disclosing the donation sooner and with as much specificity as possible.\nOperational inconveniences for the foundation or a reduction in some types of donations that have been accepted in the past are small prices to pay when balanced against the serious business of United States foreign policy that affects the security of every American.\nWith this in mind, I have suggested several additional transparency measures that could be embraced by the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration going forward. Because time is limited I will not discuss each one explicitly now, but I have provided a background sheet -- Attachment A -- that outlines these measures. And my understanding is the Clinton Foundation has already accepted the fourth item listed. The willingness of all parties to voluntarily implement these additions would strengthen the commitment to transparency and at least partially mitigate the risk inherent in foreign contributions.\nI believe that every member of this committee will seek ways to support Senator Clinton's work as secretary of state. I am certain every member wants her to succeed. We have the opportunity through the leadership of President-elect Obama and Senator Clinton to establish a new foreign policy path that will greatly benefit the security and prosperity of the United States.\nAnd I look forward to our discussion with our esteemed colleague today. I applaud her willingness to take on the role of secretary of state at a very difficult moment in history.\nAnd I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Well, I thank you, Senator Lugar.\nAnd let me just say that, for the record, first of all the attachment will be made part of the record with the statement.\nAnd secondly, I think it's fair to say that Senator Lugar is not speaking from a partisan's perspective, but I think he is really expressing a view of the committee as a whole. And we look forward to having a good discussion about this.\nIf I could just say to my colleagues that what we're going to do is I'm about -- I want to take a personal privilege to let Senator Dodd say something because he has to go chair a hearing. But we're going to have a 10-minute round. We have not yet, obviously, been able to have our organizational meeting, so we'll have a chance to talk about procedures going forward.\nKERRY: But today we will go, as we have in the past, as a matter of seniority. My hope is we can get a full round, maybe plus, before we break.\nWe will take a break at about 12:45 until 2 o'clock, thereabouts, and that's by agreement with Senator Clinton and some other needs that we have to attend to.\nWe also intend to try to do the business meeting in order to try to expedite this nomination Thursday morning, when we have another hearing on another nominee. So we look forward to trying to have the cooperation of everybody to be able to do that.\nI think Senator Lugar, again, spoke to the committee and expressing our desire to have a secretary of state in place and ready to go as rapidly as possible and, obviously, on Tuesday of next week.\nThat said, let me turn to Senator Dodd. I know, Senator Schumer, you've being very patient and we appreciate it.\nSenator Dodd?\nDODD: Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I apologize to my colleagues, but as we're in the midst of all of this, it's sort of a New York day. I'll leave here and Shaun Donovan is the nominee to be the new secretary of HUD and I have to chair that hearing as chairman of the Banking Committee.\nMr. Duncan is the designee to be the new secretary of education. I'm the ranking Democrat on that committee, as well. So we have a busy day in front of us. I'm going to be very, very brief and ask consent, Mr. Chairman, that a longer statement be included in the record.\nBut I wanted to, first of all, commend you, Mr. Chairman. This is a -- you are so well suited to this job as chairman of this committee, your background and experience, your knowledge of these issues, and I'm very excited about your leadership of this committee.\nAnd let me, as well, underscore the point you made about Claiborne Pell and Dick Lugar, as well, Joe Biden. We've been blessed in this committee over the years with some remarkable people to chair this committee and you're going to carry on in that tradition.\nLet me also welcome and congratulate my wonderful friend from New York, the nominee, Senator Clinton. I've worked with her over the years and I am very excited, as all of us are, about your nomination and look forward to having a very strong and healthy relationship between the State Department and this committee.\nI don't think it's overstating the case to say that you will be inheriting some of the largest and most difficult international challenges the United States has faced in over half a century and, as has been said by Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, the threat of terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction still loom large and our own prestige, influence and elements of our soft power have been questioned, and as our commitment to the rule of law.\nAnd while these issue and others, including the crisis in Gaza and our relationships with China and Russia, are very much at the forefront of our minds, I want to just raise one issue briefly before departing and hopefully getting back later in the day to discuss this with you further.\nBut as I mentioned, I'm chairman of the Banking Committee and the one issue that overlaps almost all of this, in many ways, is the global economic crisis. While we're very much aware of it here in our own country, with the problems we're grappling with every single day, I think most are aware today this is not just a localized problem in the sense that every other issue we are dealing with will be affected by our ability to grapple effectively with the economic crisis we face.\nThis crisis has inflicted seriously and wide-reaching damage to which no nation is immune. As important as our domestic response is to this crisis, I think it is particularly critical that we developed a well coordinated international strategy to deal with what, in many ways, as fundamental to our own well being as our physical security, our economic security.\nBoth the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, as well as the Senate Committee on Banking, maintain jurisdiction over a wide array of international economic issues and my intent is, along with Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, to work together on these issues.\nWe have jurisdiction in the Banking Committee over many of the international institutions and, yet, obviously, it's a matter of deep concern to this committee, as well.\nSo we need to coordinate our activities and I raise that because the jurisdictional overlap is similar to the jurisdictional overlap that currently exists within the executive branch, the State Department and the Treasury Department.\nSenator Clinton, you and I have discussed this issue briefly and had a chance to talk about it, but in order to implement an effective international policy response to the economic crisis, we first must ensure that there's a coordinated leadership on this issue.\nAnd so I raise that point before leaving. You may address it in your statement. I'm not sure if you're going to or not, but it's tremendously important. And I certainly look forward to working with Senator Kerry and you and others on these issues and how we can coordinate our activities.\nBut again, I welcome you. I'm excited about your leadership role as the new secretary of state. I commend you and Senator -- President-elect Obama for doing this. There's been a lot of speculation about having two candidates who sought the presidency taking on these responsibilities.\nI think it says volumes about both of you. The idea that this president-elect is not in any way threatened by a significant challenger to ask her to be a part of his team and your willingness to step up and accept that challenge, as well, is, I think, what makes this country so unique in the eyes of the world.\nSo I wish you the very best.\nKERRY: Thank you, Senator Dodd, for those arm and generous comments and we appreciate it, and we very much look forward, obviously, to working very closely with you on that.\nThe international and global economic linkages nowadays have really transformed foreign policy and we're already looking within our staff structure on the committee for ways to try to address that more effectively.\nSenator Schumer and Senator Clinton, you've both been very patient and we appreciate it enormously.\nLet me, as I introduce you, Senator Schumer, also welcome Chelsea. We are delighted to have you here. Your mother said, as we were walking across the dais, that she wished you weren't sitting behind her, but she could look at you up here.\nSo since your father served as an intern on this committee, maybe we can make you an intern for a day, chairman's prerogative. So if you want to come up here later and look out, we're happy to welcome you.\nSo, Senator Schumer, thanks so much for joining here. Happy to have you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIs that for Senator Schumer or for Chelsea?\nSCHUMER: Chelsea, for sure.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is a true honor to be here. I want to thank you and Ranking Member Lugar, all the members of the committee for the opportunity for the honor, the true honor of introducing my friend and colleague, Senator Clinton.\nBefore I do, I want to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on your ascension to the chairmanship and I share the confidence of many that you'll be a truly great chairman of this committee and look forward to watching the committee work.\nNow, colleagues, I've known Hillary a long time and I'm confident that there is no one -- no one -- who would better serve our country and the world as the next secretary of state.\nWe're in a new era. The world is yearning for strong, but consultative American leadership and foreign policy. Hillary Rodham Clinton, as secretary of state, is exactly the right person at the right time.\nHillary has spent more time under the national political spotlight than almost anyone, first as first lady, then in her race for the New York Senate seat, her subsequent eight years at Senate, and then her historic victories in her campaign for the democratic presidential nomination, and now, finally, as President-elect Obama's choice for secretary of state.\nThrough all of this time, Hillary has demonstrated the equanimity, prudence, the fortitude that have made her an exceptional leader and public servant.\nSCHUMER: In her years as first lady, Senator Clinton was one of the country's most important and best loved ambassadors. She traveled to over 80 countries, meeting with heads of state from the Czech Republic to Nepal.\nShe served as a representative to the United Nations, addressing forums around the world. She has negotiated aid packages in Asia, pushed democratic reforms in the former Soviet Bloc, and promoted peace plans in northern Ireland and Serbia.\nBut Hillary didn't just meet with world leaders. She has met with private citizens around the world whose lives are shaped by international decisions.\nShe has met survivors of the Rwandan genocide. She has met with advocates for social justice and women's rights in Pakistan and with the families of children kidnapped in Uganda.\nAnd after serving her country eight years as first lady, when most people would retire, Hillary stepped up and has served as a vital and powerful advocate on behalf of the people of New York, going from the White House to White Plains.\nHillary has continued to show just as much acumen as in her dealings with national and global leaders as she shows empathy and interest in the needs of private individuals around New York.\nIn all of her many roles as a public servant, Hillary has always shown the insight to see the heart of a problem, the courage to tackle it, and the talent to solve it.\nWhat could be a better description of what we need as secretary of state?\nAnd no matter how abstract the problem, no matter how esoteric the question, Hillary has never once forgotten the peoples whose lives and happiness depend on her work.\nHillary, you've dedicated your career to improving the lives of the least fortunate. Since your work 30 years ago with the Children's Defense Fund, you've come a long way, but you've always retained your tireless efforts to better the world.\nFor me, it's been a pleasure and a privilege serving with you in the Senate and I will sorely miss you. But I wish you the best of luck and I know that you will be a brilliant secretary of state. KENNEDY: Thank you very much, Senator Schumer.\nAnd I know we need to excuse you post cog to go about other duties and I know that our Republican colleagues are thrilled that those duties no longer include being chairman of the Campaign Committee.\nSCHUMER: Mr. Chairman, it is, as Chris Dodd mentioned, a New York day and I have to go introduce Shaun Donovan at the Banking Committee.\nKENNEDY: We understand that. Thank you so much.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, colleagues. I appreciate it very much.\nKENNEDY: Well, Madam Secretary-designate, we are, again, really delighted to welcome you here and we look forward to your testimony and have a chance to get some questions in. Thanks so much.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And as he's leaving, I want to thank Senator Schumer for that generous introduction and even more for his support and our partnership over so many years.\nHe's been a valued and trusted colleague, a friend and a tribute to the people of New York whom he has served with such distinction.\nMr. Chairman, I join in offering my congratulations as you take on this new role. You've traveled quite a distance from that day back in 1971 when you testified here as a young Vietnam veteran.\nYou have never faltered in your care and concern for our nation, its foreign policy and its future, and America is in good hands with you leading this committee.\nAnd, Senator Lugar, I look forward to working with you on a wide range of issues, especially those of greatest concern to you, including the Nunn-Lugar initiative.\nAnd let me say a word to Senator Voinovich because of his announcement yesterday. I want to commend you for your service to the people of Ohio and I ask for your help in the next two years on the management issues that you have long championed.\nIt is an honor and a privilege to be here this morning as President-elect Obama's nominee for secretary of state. I am deeply grateful for the trust and keenly aware of the responsibility that the president-elect has placed in me to serve our country and to serve our people at a time of such grave dangers and great possibilities.\nIf confirmed, I will accept the duties of the office with gratitude, humility and firm determination to represent the United States as energetically and faithfully as I can.\nAt the same time, I must confess that sitting across the table from so many colleagues brings me sadness, too. I love the Senate and if you confirm me for this new role, it will be hard to say goodbye to so many members, Republicans and Democrats, whom I have come to know, admire and respect deeply, and to this institution where I have been so proud to serve on behalf of the people of New York through some very difficult days over the past eight years.\nBut I assure you I will be in frequent consultation and conversation with the members of this committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Appropriations Committees, and with Congress as a whole, and I look forward to working with my good friend, Vice President-elect Biden, who has been a valued colleague and a very valued chairman of this committee.\nFor me, consultation is not a catch word. It is a commitment. The president-elect and I believe that we must return to the time honored principle of bipartisanship in our foreign policy, an approach that has served our nation well.\nI look forward to working with all of you to renew America's leadership through diplomacy that enhances our security, advances our interests, and reflects our values.\nToday, our nation and our world face great peril from ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the continuing threats posed by terrorist extremists, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, from the dangers of climate change to pandemic disease, from financial meltdowns to worldwide poverty.\nThe 70 days since the presidential election offer fresh evidence of these challenges, new conflict in Gaza, terrorist attacks in Mumbai, mass killings and rapes in the Congo, cholera in Zimbabwe, record high greenhouse gases and rapidly melting glaciers, and even an ancient form of terror -- piracy -- asserting itself in modern form off the Horn of Africa.\nCLINTON: Always and especially in the crucible of these global challenges, our overriding duty is to protect and advance America's security, interests and values, to keep our people, our nation and our allies secure, to promote economic growth and shared prosperity at home and abroad, and to strengthen America's position of global leadership so we remain a positive force in the world, whether in working to preserve the health of our planet or expanding opportunity for people on the margins whose progress and prosperity will add to our own.\nOur world has undergone an extraordinary transformation in the last two decades. In 1989, a wall fell and old barriers began to crumble after 40 years of a Cold War that had influenced every aspect of our foreign policy. By 1999, the rise of more democratic and open societies, the expanding reach of world markets, and the explosion of information technology had made globalization the word of the day.\nFor most people, it had primarily an economic connotation, but, in fact, we were already living in a profoundly interdependent world in which old rules and boundaries no longer held fast, a world in which both the promise and the peril of the 21st century could not be contained by national borders or vast distances.\nEconomic growth lifted more people out of poverty faster than at any time in our history, but economic crises can sweep across the globe even more quickly. A coalition of nations stopped ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, but the conflict in the Middle East continues to inflame tensions from Africa to Asia. Non-state actors fight poverty, improve health, and expand education in the poorest parts of the world, while other non-state actors traffic in drugs, children, and women and kill innocent civilians across the globe.\nNow, in 2009, the clear lesson of the last 20 years is that we must both combat the threats and seize the opportunities of our interdependence, and to be effective in doing so, we must build a world with more partners and fewer adversaries. America cannot solve the most pressing problems on our own, and the world cannot solve them without America.\nThe best way to advance America's interests in reducing global threats and seizing global opportunities is to design and implement global solutions. That isn't a philosophical point. This is our reality.\nThe president-elect and I believe that foreign policy must be based on a marriage of principles and pragmatism, not rigid ideology, on facts and evidence, not emotion or prejudice. Our security, our vitality, and our ability to lead in today's world oblige us to recognize the overwhelming facts of our interdependence.\nI believe that American leadership has been wanting, but is still wanted. We must use what has been called smart power, the full range of tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural -- picking the right tool or combination of tools for each situation. With smart power, diplomacy will be the vanguard of our foreign policy. This is not a radical idea. The Ancient Roman poet Terence declared that \"In every endeavor, the seemly course for wise men is to try persuasion first.\" The same truth binds wise women as well.\nI assure you that if I am confirmed, the State Department will be firing on all cylinders to provide forward-thinking, sustained diplomacy in every part of the world, applying pressure wherever it may be needed, but also looking for opportunities: exerting leverage; cooperating with our military and other agencies of government; partnering with non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and international organizations; using modern technologies for public outreach; empowering negotiators who can protect our interests while understanding those of our negotiating partners. Diplomacy is hard work, but when we work hard, diplomacy can work, not just to defuse tensions, but to achieve results that advance our security interests and values.\nSecretary Gates, as the chairman said, has been particularly eloquent in articulating the importance of diplomacy. As he notes, it's not often that a secretary of defense makes the case for adding resources to the State Department and elevating the role of the diplomatic corps. Thankfully Secretary Gates is more concerned about having a unified, agile, and effective U.S. strategy than in spending precious time and energy on petty turf wars. As he has stated, \"Our civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and underfunded for far too long.\" That is a statement that I can only heartily say amen to.\nPresident-elect Obama has emphasized that the State Department must be fully empowered and funded to confront multidimensional challenges from thwarting terrorism to spreading health and prosperity in places of human suffering, and I will speak in greater detail about that in a moment.\nWe should also use the United Nations and other institutions whenever possible and appropriate. Both Democratic and Republican presidents have understood that these institutions, when they work well, enhance our influence, and when they don't work well, as in the cases of Darfur and the farce of Sudan's election to the former U.N. Commission on Human Rights, we should work with like-minded friends to make them more effective.\nWe will lead with diplomacy because that's the smart approach, but we also know that military force will sometimes be necessary, and we will rely on it to protect our people and our interests when and where needed as a last resort. All the while, we must remember that to promote our interests around the world, America must be an exemplar of our values.\nSenator Isakson made the point to me the other day that our nation must lead by example rather than edict. Our history has shown that we are most effective when we see the harmony between our interests abroad and our values at home. Our first secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson, subscribed to that view, reminding us across the centuries, \"The interests of a nation when well understood will be found to coincide with their moral duties.\"\nSenator Lugar, I'm going to borrow your words here, too. As you said, \"The United States cannot feed every person, lift every person out of poverty, cure every disease, or stop every conflict, but our power and status have conferred upon us a tremendous responsibility to humanity.\"\nOf course, we must be realistic. Even under the best of circumstances, our nation cannot solve every problem or meet every global need. We don't have unlimited time, treasure, or manpower, especially with our own economy faltering and our budget deficits growing. So, to fulfill our responsibility to our children, to protect and defend our nation, while honoring our values, we have to establish priorities.\nI'm not trying to mince words here. As my colleagues in the Senate know, establishing priorities means making tough choices. Because these choices are so important to the American people, we must be disciplined in evaluating them, weighing the costs and consequences of action or inaction, gauging the probability of success, and insisting on measurable results.\nRight after I was nominated, a friend told me, \"The world has so many problems. You've got your work cut out for you.\" Well, I agree, but I don't get up every morning thinking only about the threats and dangers we face. In spite of all the adversity and complexity, there are so many opportunities for America out there, calling forth the optimism and can-do spirit that has marked our progress for more than two centuries.\nToo often, we see the ills that plague us more clearly than the possibilities in front of us, but it is the real possibility of progress, of that better life free from fear and want and discord, that offers our most compelling message to the rest of the world.\nI've had the chance to lay out and submit my views on a broad array of issues and written responses to questions from the committee. So this statement will only outline some of the major challenges we face and the major opportunities we see as well.\nFirst, President-elect Obama is committed to responsibly ending the war in Iraq and employing a broad strategy in Afghanistan that reduces threats to our safety and enhances the prospects of stability and peace. Right now, our men and women in uniform, our diplomats, and our aid workers are risking their lives in these two countries. They have done everything we have asked of them and more.\nBut, over time, our larger interests will be best served by safely and responsibly withdrawing our troops from Iraq, supporting a transition to full Iraqi responsibility for their sovereign nation, rebuilding our overtaxed military, and reaching out to other nations to help stabilize the region and employ a broader arsenal of tools to fight terrorism. We will use all the elements of our power -- diplomacy, development, and defense -- to work with those in Afghanistan and Pakistan who want to root out Al Qaida, the Taliban, and other violent extremists who threaten them as well as us in what President-elect Obama has called the central front in the fight against terrorism.\nAs we focus on Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, we must also actively pursue a strategy of smart power in the Middle East that addresses the security needs of Israel and the legitimate political and economic aspirations of the Palestinians; that effectively challenges Iran to end its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror; and persuade both Iran and Syria to abandon their dangerous behavior and become constructive regional actors; and that also strengthens our relationship with Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, other Arab states, along with Turkey and our partners in the Gulf, to involve them in securing a lasting peace in the region.\nAs intractable as the Middle East problems may seem -- and many presidents, including my husband, have spent years trying to work out a resolution -- we cannot give up on peace. The president-elect and I understand and are deeply sympathetic to Israel's desire to defend itself under the current conditions and to be free of shelling by Hamas rockets.\nHowever, we have also been reminded of the tragic humanitarian cost of conflict in the Middle East and pained by the suffering of Palestinian and Israeli civilians. This must only increase our determination to seek a just and lasting peace agreement that brings real security to Israel; normal and positive relations with its neighbors; independence, economic progress, and security to the Palestinians in their own states.\nWe will exert every effort to support the work of Israelis and Palestinians who seek that result. It is critical not only to the parties involved, but to undermining the forces of alienation and violent extremism around the world.\nFor terrorism, we must have a comprehensive strategy, levering intelligence, diplomacy, and military assets to defeat Al Qaida and other terrorist groups by rooting out their networks and drying up their support for violent and nihilistic extremism.\nThe gravest threat that America faces is the danger that weapons of mass destruction will fall into the hands of terrorists. We must curb the spread and use of these weapons -- nuclear, biological, chemical, or cyber -- and prevent the development and use of dangerous new weapons. Therefore, while defending against the threat of terrorism, we will also seize the parallel opportunity to get America back in the business of engaging other nations to reduce nuclear stockpiles.\nThe Nonproliferation Treaty is the cornerstone of the nonproliferation regime, and the United States must exercise leadership needed to shore it up. So we will seek agreements with Russia to secure further reductions in weapons under START, we will work with this committee and the Senate toward ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and we will dedicate efforts to revive negotiations on a verifiable Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.\nAt the same time, we will continue to work to prevent proliferation in North Korea and Iran, to secure loose nuclear weapons and materials, and to shut down the market for selling them, as Senator Lugar has pushed for so many years.\nThese threats, however, cannot be addressed in isolation. Smart power requires reaching out to both friends and adversaries to bolster old alliances and to forge new ones. That means strengthening the alliances that have stood the test of time, especially with our NATO partners and our allies in Asia. Our alliance with Japan is a cornerstone of American policy in Asia, essential to maintaining peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region, and based on shared values and mutual interests.\nWe also have crucial economic and security partnerships with South Korea, Australia, and other friends in ASEAN. We will build on our economic and political partnership with India, the world's most populous democracy and a nation with growing influence in the world. Our traditional relationships of confidence and trust with Europe will be deepened. Disagreements are inevitable, but on most global issues, we have no more trusted allies.\nThe new administration will reach out across the Atlantic to leaders in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and others, including and especially the new democracies.\nPresident-elect Obama and I seek a future of cooperative engagement with the Russian government on matters of strategic importance while standing strongly for American values and international norms.\nChina is critically important as an actor who will be changing the global landscape. We want a positive and cooperative relationship with China, one (TSXV:IND) where we deepen and strengthen our ties on a number of issues and candidly address differences where they persist. But this is not a one-way effort. Much of what we will do depends on the choices China makes about its future at home and abroad.\nCLINTON: With both Russia and China we should work together on vital security and economic issues like terrorism, proliferation, climate change, and reforming financial markets.\nThe world is now, as Senator Dodd said, in the crosscurrents of the most severe global economic contraction since the Great Depression. The history of that crisis teaches us the consequences of diplomatic failures and uncoordinated reactions.\nWe have already seen this crisis extend beyond the housing and banking sectors, and our solutions will have to be as wide in scope as the causes themselves, taking into account the complexities of the global economy, the geopolitics, and the continued political and economic repercussions from the damage already done.\nBut here again, as we work to repair the damage we can find new ways of working together. For too long we've merely talked about the need to engage emerging powers in global economic governance. The time to take action is upon us.\nThe recent G-20 meeting that President Bush hosted was a first step. But developing patterns of sustained engagement will take hard work and careful negotiation. We know that emerging markets like China and India, Brazil and South Africa and Indonesia are feeling the effects of the current crisis. And we all stand to benefit, in both the short and long term, if they are part of the solution and become partners in maintaining global economic stability.\nIn our efforts to return to economic growth here in the United States, we have an especially critical need to work more closely with Canada, our largest trading partner, and Mexico, our third largest.\nCanada and Mexico are also our biggest suppliers of imported energy. More broadly, we must build a deeper partnership with Mexico to address the shared dangers arising from drug trafficking and the challenges along our border, an effort begun this week with the meeting between President-elect Obama and President Calderon.\nThroughout our hemisphere, we have opportunities to enhance our relationships that will benefit all of us. We will return to a policy of vigorous involvement, partnership even, with Latin America, from the Caribbean to Central America to South America. We share common political, economic, and strategic interests with our friends to the south, as well as many of our citizens who share ancestral and cultural legacies. We're looking forward to working on many issues during the Summit of the Americas in April and taking up the president-elect's call for a new energy partnership around shared technology and new investments in renewable energy.\nAnd in Africa the foreign policy objectives of the Obama administration are rooted in security, political, economic and humanitarian interests, including combating Al Qaida's efforts to seek save havens in failed states in the Horn of Africa, helping African nations conserve their natural resources and reaping fair benefits from them, stopping war in the Congo, ending autocracy in Zimbabwe and human devastation in Darfur.\nBut we also intend to support the African democracies like South Africa and Ghana, which just had its second peaceful change of power in a democratic election. We must work hard with our African friends to reach the millennium development goals in health education and economic opportunity.\nMany significant problems we face will challenge us not only on a bilateral basis but all nations.\nYou, Mr. Chairman, were among the very first in a growing chorus from both parties to recognize that climate change is an unambiguous security threat. At the extreme, it threatens our very existence. But well before that point, it could well incite new wars of an old kind over basic resources like food, water, and arable land.\nPresident-elect Obama has said America must be a leader in developing and implementing a global and coordinated effort to climate change. We will participate in the upcoming UN Copenhagen climate conference and a global energy forum and will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas, fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security.\nGeorge Marshall noted that our gravest enemies are often not nations or doctrines but hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. So to create more friends and fewer enemies, we must find common ground and common purpose with other peoples and nations to overcome hatred, violence, lawlessness, and despair.\nThe Obama administration recognizes that even when we cannot fully agree with some governments we share a bond of humanity with their people. By investing in that common humanity, we advance our common security.\nMr. Chairman, you were one of the first, again, to underscore the importance of our involvement in the global AIDS fight. Now, thanks to a variety of efforts, including President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, as well as the work of NGOs and foundations, the United States enjoys widespread support in public opinion polls in many African countries. Even among Muslim populations in Tanzania and Kenya, America is seen as a leader in the fight against AIDS, malaria, and TB. We have an opportunity to build on this success by partnering with NGOs to help expand health clinics in Africa so more people can have access to lifesaving drugs, fewer mothers transmit HIV to their children, and fewer lives are lost.\nWe can generate more goodwill through other kinds of social investments, again partnering with international organizations and NGOs, to build schools and train teachers. The president-elect supports a global education fund to bolster secular education around the world.\nI want to emphasize the importance to us of this bottoms-up approach. The president-elect and I believe in this so strongly: Investing in our common humanity through social development is not marginal to our foreign policy but essential to the realization of our goals.\nMore than two billion people worldwide live on less than $2 a day. They're facing rising food prices and widespread hunger. We have to expand civil and political rights in countries that are plagued by poverty, hunger, and disease. But our pleas will fall on deaf ears unless democracy actually improves people's lives while weeding out the corruption that too often stands in the way of progress.\nOur foreign policy must reflect our deep commitment to help millions of oppressed people around the world. And of particular concern to me is the plight of women and girls, who comprise the majority of the world's unhealthy, unschooled, unfed, and unpaid. If half the world's population remains vulnerable to economic, political, legal and social marginalization, our hope of advancing democracy and prosperity is in serious jeopardy. The United States must be an unequivocal and unwavering voice in support of women's rights in every country on every continent.\nAs a personal aside, I want to mention that President-elect Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was a pioneer in microfinance in Indonesia. In my own work on microfinance around the world, from Bangladesh to Chile to Viet Nam to South Africa and many other countries, I've seen firsthand how small loans given to poor women to start businesses can raise standards of living and transform local economies.\nThe president-elect's mother had planned to attend a microfinance forum at the Beijing Women's Conference in 1995 that I participated in. Unfortunately, she was very ill and couldn't travel and, sadly, passed away a few months later. But I think it's fair to say that her work in international development, the care and concern she showed for women and for poor people around the world, mattered greatly to her son, our president-elect. And I believe that it has certainly informed his views and his vision. We will be honored to carry on Ann Dunham's work in the years ahead.\nMr. Chairman, I know we'll address many issues in the question and answer session. But I want to underscore a final point. Ensuring that our State Department is functioning at its best is absolutely essential to America's success. The president-elect and I believe strongly that we need to invest in our capacity to conduct vigorous American diplomacy, provide the kind of foreign assistance that I've mentioned, reach out to the world, and operate effectively alongside our military.\nNow, the entire State Department bureaucracy in Thomas Jefferson's day consisted of a chief clerk, three regular clerks and a messenger. And its entire budget was $56,000 a year.\nBut over the past 219 years, the world has certainly changed. Now the department consists of Foreign Service officers, the civil services, and our locally engaged staff, working not only at Foggy Bottom but in offices across our country and in some 260 posts around the world. And USAID carries out its critical development missions in some of the most difficult places on our earth.\nThese public servants are too often the unsung heroes. They are in the trenches putting our policies and values to work in a complicated and dangerous world. Many risk their lives, and some have lost their lives in service to our nation. They need and deserve the resources, training and support to succeed.\nI know this committee, and I hope the American public, understands that Foreign Service officers and civil service professionals and development experts are doing invaluable work. And it is the work of the American people, whether helping American businesses make inroads in new markets or being on the other end of the phone when someone gets in trouble beyond our shores, needs a passport, needs advice at an embassy, or doing the delicate work of diplomacy and development with foreign governments that leads to arms control and trade agreements, peace treaties and post-conflict reconstruction, standing up for greater human rights and empowerment, broader cultural understanding and building alliances.\nState Department is a large, multidimensional organization but not the placid, idle bureaucracy that some have suggested. It is an outpost for American values that protects our citizens and safeguards our democratic institutions in times both turbulent and tame. State Department employees offer a lifeline of hope and help, often the only lifeline for people in foreign lands who are oppressed, silenced and marginalized. We must not shortchange them or ourselves.\nOne of my first priorities is to make sure that the State Department and USAID have the resources they need, and I will be back to make the case to the committee for full funding of the president's budget requests. But I will work just as hard to make sure we manage those resources prudently, efficiently and effectively.\nYou know, like most Americans, when I was growing up I never had the chance to travel widely. Most of my early professional career was as a lawyer and an advocate for children and the poor who found themselves disadvantaged here at home.\nBut during the eight years of my husband's presidency and now eight years as the senator from New York, I have been privileged to travel on behalf of our country. And I've had the opportunity to get to know many world leaders.\nAs a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I've spent time with our military commanders as well as our brave troops. I've immersed myself in a number of military issues. And I've spent many hours with American and non-American aid workers, business men and women, religious leaders, teachers, doctors, nurses, students, volunteers, all who have made it their mission to help other people across the world. And I've seen countless ordinary people in foreign capitals, small towns and rural villages who live in a world far removed from our experiences.\nIn recent years, as other nations have risen to compete for military, economic, and political influence, some have argued that we have reached the end of the American moment in world history. Well, I disagree.\nYes, the conventional paradigms have shifted. But America's success has never been solely a function of our power. It has always been rooted in and inspired by our values.\nWith so many troubles here at home and around the world, millions of people are still trying to come to this country, legally and illegally. Why? Because we are guided by unchanging truths: that all people are created equal, that each person has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\nAnd in these truths we will find, as we have for more than two centuries, the courage, the discipline and the creativity to meet the challenges of this ever-changing world.\nI am humbled to be a public servant and honored by the responsibility placed on me should I be confirmed by our president- elect who embodies the American dream, not only here at home but far beyond our shores.\nNo matter how daunting the challenges may be, I have a steadfast faith in this country and in our people. And I am proud to be an American at the dawning of this new American moment.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of this committee for granting me your time and attention today. I know there's a lot more territory to cover, and I'd be delighted to answer your questions.\nKERRY: Well, thank you very much, senator, for a very comprehensive and thoughtful statement.\nAnd I can tell you, from certainly this senator's perspective, it's wonderful to hear so many of these issues set out as priorities for the new administration. And we're excited about the prospect of working with you in order to implement the policies in greater detail that will support the agenda that you've set out.\nKERRY: I'd just say to all my colleagues, I think we all know this, that this committee and the Congress, in its role in foreign policy, has been at its strongest when we've been bipartisan and I think the old adage about politics ending at the water's edge with respect to diplomacy and our national security interest is something that would serve us well as a guidepost as we think about the enormity of the choices that we're going to face in the days ahead.\nWe will begin now a ten-minute question round. And in deference to Senator Corker, who has the same obligations as Senator Dodd, since we let Senator Dodd go, we're going to let him go after.\nSenator Lugar, is that amenable to you? And then we'll go through this.\nSo we'll start the clock running on a ten-minute series of questions.\nI think, Senator, that in your opening, you've wonderfully covered a broad array of the challenges and the task, obviously, before all of us is really now to try to hone in a little bit, see how these are really going to play out with specific regions and specific countries and challenges.\nObviously, one of the most pressing issues we face, and it was underscored in the \"New York Times\" on Sunday, is a question of Iran's nuclear program and the entire relationship with Iran, which was, needless to say, a subject of discussion throughout the campaign.\nThe time when Iran is going to be capable of producing enough weapons grade uranium to build a bomb, if they choose to, is very fast approaching. The clock is ticking and yet Iran continues to defy the U.N. resolutions, enriching more uranium to reactor grade levels, installing and operating more and more centrifuges, failing to address the concerns of inspectors and so forth. And recent efforts to get though, as you know, failed with respect to the U.N. Security Council.\nSo I would ask you, during the campaign, President-elect Obama said that he would employ, quote, \"big carrots and big sticks\" to deal with Iran's nuclear program.\nWe do know that there's a significant package of incentives already on the table from the P-5-plus-1 and the prospect of increased Security Council sanctions may be questionable, at best.\nSo could you share with us the thinking at this stage? I know it's early. But can you share with us what additional carrots the administration might have in mind? Why do you believe those might be enough to change Iran's calculations?\nAre tougher sanctions achievable and how are you and the administration viewing this at this point?\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Obviously, the incoming administration views with great concern the role that Iran is playing in the world, its sponsorship of terrorism, its continuing interference with the functioning of other governments and its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\nThere is an ongoing policy review that the Obama administration has undertaken, but I think, as the president-elect said just this past weekend, our goal will be to do everything we can to pursue, through diplomacy, through the use of sanctions, through creating better coalitions with countries that we believe also have a big stake in preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon power, to try to prevent this from occurring.\nWe are not taking any option off the table at all, but we will pursue a new, perhaps different approach that will become a cornerstone of what the Obama administration believes is an attitude toward engagement that might bear fruit.\nWe have no illusions, Mr. Chairman, that even with a new administration, looking to try to engage Iran in a way that might influence its behavior, that we can predict the results.\nBut the president-elect is committed to that course and we will pursue it.\nKERRY: Do you believe that tougher U.N. sanctions are available from which to choose and, secondly, are they achievable?\nCLINTON: You know, it's kind of like the experimenter's bias, in a way. We won't know what we're capable of achieving until we're actually there working on it.\nWe have a commitment to engaging with international organizations in a very intense and ongoing way. We are going to be working with our friends and our adversaries in the United Nations. We're going to be making the case to members of the Security Council who have been either dubious or unwilling to cooperate up until now that a nuclear armed Iran is in no one's interest under any circumstances.\nSo, Mr. Chairman, it's hard to predict how successful we will be, but I promise you our very best efforts in doing all that we can to try to achieve greater international support for sanctions and action that could actually influence the behavior of the Iranian government, the supreme leader and the religious council and the revolutionary guard the Quds Force, because, as you know so well, all these are players.\nAnd so our task will be to try to figure out the appropriate and effective pressure that will perhaps lead to us dissuading Iran from going forward.\nKERRY: Well, I happen to agree with you that it is, in fact, legitimately impossible to be able to determine exactly what options are available until you begin to get into a conversation and begin to see what the play is.\nBut as a matter of fundamental American policy, let me ask you a question.\nIs it the policy of the incoming administration, as a bottom line of our security interests and our policy, that it is unacceptable that Iran has a weapon under any circumstances and that we will take any steps necessary to prevent that or is it simply not desirable? I think, as you said, it's in no one's interest, which is less than the formation of the prohibition.\nCLINTON: Well, Mr. President -- the president-elect, Mr. Chairman...\nKERRY: I'll take that.\nCLINTON: It was a Freudian slip. The president-elect...\nKERRY: We're both subject to those, I want you to know.\nCLINTON: Yes, indeed, indeed, on this subject, especially.\nThe president-elect has said repeatedly it is unacceptable. It is going to be United States policy to pursue diplomacy with all of its multitudinous tools to do everything we can to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\nAs I also said, no option is off the table. So the president- elect has been very clear that it is unacceptable and that is our premise and that is what we are going to be basing our actions on.\nKERRY: The Bush administration sent Undersecretary Burns to the last round of those talks, essentially as an observer. Do you plan to send a U.S. representative to engage directly in those kinds of discussions almost immediately?\nCLINTON: Mr. Chairman, we are looking at a range of possibilities. One very important aspect of the decisions we make is that we engage in consultation with our friends in the region and beyond.\nWe don't want anything I say today or anything the president- elect says to take our friends and allies by surprise. So we cannot tell you with specificity exactly the steps we will take.\nBut I think it's fair to say that the president-elect, as recently as this weekend, has said that we're going to be trying new approaches, because what we've tried has not worked. They are closer to nuclear weapons capacity today than they were.\nSo we're going to be looking broadly, but in consultation. And I want to underscore that, because it's very important that those who have to live in the region, many of whom are allies, Israel and others who have a legitimate set of concerns about Iran's growing power and its use of that power, should know that the Obama administration will be consulting broadly and deeply.\nSo that when we move, we will move in concert insofar as possible.\nKERRY: Do you plan personally to engage in personal diplomacy with Iranian officials at a high level in the near term?\nCLINTON: Well, again, Mr. Chairman, I want to wait to determine the exact contours of how we proceed until we're actually in office and have a chance to consult with others, because it is very clear to me that we have not as full a brief as we need on the feelings of many of the important players.\nWe have carefully hued to the president-elect's position. There's one president at a time. We have not spoken with foreign leaders. We have not, in many instances, taken their calls because we want to be very respectful of the ongoing work of the Bush administration.\nAs soon as we are in a position to do so, we will be consulting and we will be setting forth a series of actions and we will be consulting and informing this committee.\nKERRY: Well, I know you've been very careful about that and I think it's been appropriate and I think a wise course, and I look forward to you being able to get deeply engaged.\nLast question, just quickly. Last year, six colleagues and I, including Senator Levin, wrote to Secretary Rice urging her to establish an interests section in Tehran. It just seems counterproductive and almost incomprehensible that we're not on the ground in some of these places.\nWe don't have an ambassador in Syria, for instance. We should've.\nSo I would ask you if you have made a decision and will there be -- will you proceed forward to create an interests section in Tehran and immediately put an ambassador back in Syria?\nCLINTON: Again, Mr. Chairman, these are matters that are part of our policy review and we will turn to them with great diligence and attention as soon as we are able to.\nKERRY: Well, I hope the question establishes some sense of priority.\nCLINTON: I think I got your drift, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Senator Lugar?\nLUGAR: Mr. Chairman, could you recognize Senator Corker... KERRY: Yes, absolutely.\nLUGAR: ... then Senator Feingold? You'll do that?\nKERRY: Yes. Thank you very much. I'd be delighted to do that.\nLUGAR: It would expedite his work.\nKERRY: Thank you so much.\nSenator Corker?\nCORKER: Thank you, Senator Lugar, I appreciate that. And, Chairman Kerry, I'm glad you're going to be leading this year. I think you're the right person to be doing it at this time and I thank you for your leadership.\nMadam Secretary-designate, we welcome you. We're always glad to see when one of our own does well and has a real job and certainly welcome your daughter.\nAlong the comments of -- and I think you have tremendous opportunities. You laid out in your opening comment sort of a travelogue of opportunities and I know that many of the opportunities that exist you didn't mention. You mentioned those certainly in Q&A back to us.\nSo the opportunities that you have as secretary of state are just huge and I think you will succeed in that role, I really do.\nI want to piggyback and not dwell on the comments that Senator Lugar made early on regarding the Clinton Foundation. And I'm just a junior Senator from Tennessee, but it seems to me that everything has seasons and this is your season and I look at the opportunities that you have to influence the world and our place in the world.\nI look at the resources that our government can bring to that under your leadership and then I look at the foundation and regardless of who's running it and how great it is, it's a speck in relation to the huge magnitude of efforts that you can put forth on behalf of our government.\nAnd so without dwelling on the details, I would encourage the steps that Senator Lugar requested to be taken. There's just no need to sully or dampen or anything the tremendous opportunities that you have and I do hope that sometime over the next two weeks, you'll educate us all as to how that's going to be done.\nBut the potential is so vast in the role that you have and so small in the other role, it just seems to me there's no reason whatsoever to have continual press comments and other kinds of things that might take away from, I think, what might be extraordinary efforts on your part.\nSo thank you so much for your service. You know, I noticed, as I've traveled the world in my short tenure here, the State Department, as you mentioned towards the end of your comments, is vast and we have people in tough parts of the world that are carrying out tough duties.\nCORKER: It's my sense that when Secretary Powell -- Powell was secretary that he really built the department. He understood, being a military person, what it meant to have a culture and for people to have the tools and training and those kinds of things necessary to really exceed in their jobs or to excel in their jobs.\nI think that's been a little bit lesser the case recently, and -- and I'm not in any way criticizing. It seems to me the secretary of state really has two major responsibilities. One is to be our chief dealmaker, and that's how you get recorded in history, and I know that there'll be many things that you're recorded that way -- that you'll be recorded in that way. But then there's the whole issue of running the department.\nMy sense is that's not probably your -- your basic strength, that you're probably going to see to the other responsibilities, and I wonder if you might educate us as to how you're going to ensure that the department really does have the support, the tools, the culture, the morale necessary to be successful while we're working on the more major accomplishments.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Corker, this is to me one of the most important questions because we can talk about all of the good work we'd like to do and how grateful we are to those people who are out there doing it, but if we don't enhance our diplomatic and development efforts and move toward more equilibrium, as Secretary Gates even has said, we will not be as successful as we need to be in promoting our foreign policy.\nSo, to that end, in consultation with the president-elect and the vice president-elect, as well as the leaders of this committee, I decided to fill a position that had not been filled, although it had been created 10 years ago, and that was the deputy for resources and management. And I concluded that that was important because what happens in every government agency, but certainly in the State Department is you get consumed by the crisis of the moment. You have the best intentions to deal with the management challenges, the resource shortages, but the secretary's time and the, you know, top diplomat's time are spent, you know, on Gaza or on Iran or on Russia and the Ukraine pipeline issue.\nSo it seemed to me that in order to really fulfill my responsibility to you and the American people, we needed to have someone whose total job focus was to manage the department, along with the career professionals, to work to manage USAID to be more effective, and to represent the interests of the department as well as the president -- presidential budget here on the Hill when it came to these resource matters.\nI feel very fortunate that you will be seeing before you for confirmation two extraordinary deputies. The principal deputy filling the role that has been there historically will be Jim Steinberg, a very accomplished foreign policy expert. He's leaving the deanship of the LBJ School at the University of Texas to take on this responsibility. And filling the second deputy position for resources and management will be Jack Lew, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, someone with deep experience here on Capitol Hill, who is diving into work already, because I want you as well as me to have someone who is accountable and the point person.\nYou know, the argument kind of stops when you say, \"Well, what about more training for our -- our Foreign Service officers? What about, you know, more funding for all of the responsibilities from reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the Office on Trafficking, and so much else? How do we do that? How do we do more with less?\" We've got to have somebody who will take charge of all those issues, and I really believe, Senator, that this will be a significant step on the way toward putting the State Department on a sounder financial and management footing.\nCORKER: We have a maze of aid efforts that are underway. Every senator that travels and sees some need authorizes another aid program. I wonder if you would consider, during the first six months you're there, rationalizing that for us and reporting back as to some of those things that need to be done away with. Again, it's -- all are in good intentions, but they seem to water each other down and not have the focus that they might otherwise have. Wondering if you might commit to doing that during some short period of time after you're there.\nCLINTON: Well, in fact, Senator, that's going to be one of the responsibilities that will given to this second deputy under my direction, to take a look at our existing authorities, to determine what works, what doesn't work, to try to eliminate redundancies, to fill gaps, because, you know, we do have some of those as well, obviously.\nYou know, it -- it matters greatly to me, as it does to the president-elect. These development efforts, these humanitarian commitments by the United States government are often the way we are perceived and frequently to our advantage if they are done correctly.\nBut I think it's fair to say that USAID, our premier aid agency, has been decimated. You know, it has half the staff it used to have. It's turned into more of a contracting agency than an operational agency with the ability to deliver. Yet at the same time, whether I'm talking to Secretary Gates or I'm -- I'm talking to people in the non- governmental organizational world, very often, they will say the same thing, \"Well, they've turned to USAID to determine how to implement these programs.\"\nSo we're going to take a hard look at all of our aid and development effort. Additionally, the Congress has given the State Department a very important responsibility with reconstruction and stabilization. If we're going to move authorities and resources back from the Defense Department to the State Department, we have to be able to function effectively and demonstrate our efficiency. We're at a great disadvantage.\nI'll give you just a quick example. There's a program that I learned about, of course, on my Senate Foreign -- my Senate Armed Services Committee work called CERP, the Commanders Emergency Resources Program. I remember the first time I went to Iraq in 2003, and I met young captains and majors and -- and lieutenant colonels who were literally handed thousands of dollars of cash and told, \"Go get that school open. Go get that road built. Go fix that, you know, sewer problem.\" And they were doing an incredible job with great flexibility and very little accountability.\nI came back a believer in the CERP program and advocated for it to continue, but when I contrast that with a development officer or a State Department expert who knows the culture, knows the language, unlike, you know, this very well-meaning and well-trained warrior, and that person can't get $500 to fulfill a development mission that is in service of American security and our national interests, there's a big disconnect.\nSo, you know, Secretary Gates understands it. So we're going to try to better organize and rationalize what we do and build confidence with you and the rest of Congress that we can take on these responsibilities.\nKERRY: Thanks.\nThank you very much, Senator Corker.\nSenator Feingold?\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, of course, my warm congratulations to you on your new position. I look forward to working closely with you and this committee and the incoming Obama administration to reverse much of the foreign policies of the last eight years and to restore America's leadership abroad and security at home, and I would just ask that my full statement be placed in the record.\nKERRY: Without objection.\nFEINGOLD: I am very pleased Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has been nominated to be secretary of state. She's an excellent choice for our most senior diplomat, has a demonstrated record of thinking creatively about the challenges our country faces, and I want to say that she's already shown not only the indication, but, in fact, has shown a willingness on a regular basis to consult with Congress that is refreshing and very welcome as she sets up the operation she's going to have as secretary of state. I'm very, very pleased with that process. And I'd just note before I get into my questions that some of my colleagues have asked about the Clinton Foundation, and I have some questions on that topic, Mr. Chairman, that I will simply submit for the record.\nBut what I'd like to do is -- is to start off with what I think we agree on, and that is that our top national security priority is the global fight against Al Qaida and its affiliates. I was pleased with your reference in your opening statement to its efforts of Al Qaida in places like Africa, how we allocate our resources, the tools used, in this struggle is key to winning this fight, and without a more global and comprehensive approach, we will be unable to make our country or the world a safer place.\nNow the current administration's decision to focus so many of our resources on Iraq at the expense of other areas has, I think, been a tragic mistake in this regard. So I would ask you -- and I know you mentioned this issue first -- to please share your vision of how you will follow up on President-elect Obama's pledge to redeploy the bulk of our troops from Iraq in 16 months. What steps do you expect the State Department will take to ensure that this transition occurs as safely and smoothly as possible?\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, thank you very much.\nAnd, you know, this is a primary priority, as you know, of the incoming administration. The president-elect, Secretary Gates, and others are working assiduously to try to be able to begin the process of withdrawal safely and responsibly as soon as possible.\nIt is being done within the context of the Status of Forces Agreement, which has now clearly set forth the path that both the Iraqi government and the United States government intend to follow. There is some differences in timing, but the important aspect of the so-called SOFA is that the United States government under President Obama will be withdrawing troops and the Iraqi government not only accepts that, but wishes to facilitate it.\nSo we look to begin moving our combat brigades out of cities and towns and villages hopefully by June, and then proceed with the withdrawal and, in some instances, redeployment of some of those troops to Afghanistan.\nNow the military details of this are, obviously, not within the province of the State Department, but there is a companion document that was signed by the United States government and the government of Iraq which was an agreement of friendship and cooperation, and in it are listed a number of areas that we intend to be very active in pursuing on rule of law, on education and health care, technical assistance for the energy industry and the like.\nIt is -- it is my intention that we will very quickly, in consultation with the Iraqi government and other agencies within our own government, put together the teams and activities that we will be offering that will support the withdrawal of our troops and also fulfill the agreement that we have with the government of Iraq. The details are, you know, still to be worked out, as you know.\nOur current ambassador will be leaving after a very distinguished and courageous tour in Iraq for personal and health reasons, as I'm told, but he deserves a great deal of gratitude for the leadership he's provided on the civilian side, and we will look to move that nomination as quickly as possible, once we can make it, so that we have an ambassador on the ground and we have the assets deployed so that we are able to fulfill our part of the agreement as set forth.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator.\nLet me turn to another topic that we covered. You've been an outspoken advocate of U.S. action to stop genocide in Darfur and to protect the -- the fragile peace between the North and the South in Sudan. President-elect Obama, Vice President-elect Biden, and Dr. Susan Rice also have strong records of support for U.S. action to stop the ongoing violence in Sudan.\nSenator, I believe it's crucial that the new administration signal a commitment from day one to this effort. There's been a lot of talk of bold action that the United Sates can take, such as expanding sanctions, imposing a no-fly zone over Sudan, bombing aircraft, airfields and perhaps even the regime's military and intelligence assets. Can you give me your sense at this point of how viable are these options? What steps will the new administration take to demonstrate a new and bold and comprehensive approach to Sudan?\nCLINTON: Senator, again, this is an area of great concern to me, as it is to the president-elect. We are putting together the options that we think are available and workable. It is done in conjunction, as you would assume, with the Department of Defense. There is a great need for us to sound the alarm again about Darfur. It is a terrible humanitarian crisis compounded by a corrupt and, you know, very cruel regime in Khartoum, and it's important that the world know that we intend to address this in the most effective way possible once we have completed our review and that we intend to bring along as many people as we can to fulfill the mission of the U.N. A.U. force, which is not yet up to speed and fully deployed, as a very first measure. That's a preexisting policy we agree with.\nWe are going to work to try to effectuate it and then, as you rightly point out, the president-elect, the vice president-elect, I and others have spoken about other options, no fly zones, other sanctions and sanctuaries, looking to deploy the U.N. A.U. force to try to protect the refugees, but also to repel the militias.\nSo there is a lot that is under consideration and I know of your interest in this, along with other colleagues, and we will keep you advised as we move forward.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you very much. Obviously, you and the president-elect recognize the importance of our efforts in Afghanistan. And given the serious national security concerns in that part of the world, we have to address the growing instability there.\nBut keeping in mind the lessons to be learned from Iraq, we need to address Afghanistan comprehensively, which I know you realize includes looking more broadly at Pakistan and India and Iran and the larger region, and we need to think clearly rather than assuming that more troops is somehow sufficient to turn the tide.\nNow, you and I discussed the fact that there is a significant military review underway. But will there also be a policy review to ensure we define the full scope of our mission in Afghanistan and explain to the American people how sending more American troops actually fits into a comprehensive regional strategy?\nCLINTON: There will certainly be such a policy review. It is the highest priority of the president-elect. He has put forth what he calls the \"more for more\" strategy. That's if there are to be more troops from the United States, there also needs to be more support for that mission from NATO. There needs to be more work done by the government of Afghanistan and the people. And I would add that the \"more for more\" strategy is not just on the military side, it's on the civilian and development side, as well.\nWe have to look at Afghanistan and Pakistan together, particularly the border region. As you were telling me when we met, you personally have traveled along that border. You have seen with your own eyes the element of resistance and extremism that have taken root there.\nAnd it is imperative that we work with our friends in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, because this is not only about denying Al Qaida and other extremist groups safe haven, this is about persuading those two countries that their security and their future is also at risk.\nAnd I am encouraged that the democratically-elected government of Pakistan seems to be much more aware of how this is their fight, not just ours. The government of Afghanistan, as you know, the vice president-elect was just in both countries, is going to be presented with alternatives from the Obama administration that we think are not only in the interest of our overall mission, but in their interest, as well.\nSo this will be a collaboration and the other countries you mentioned are also players, to some extent, that have to be brought in.\nSo I anticipate, Senator, having a civilian review and a civilian presence that will be the counterpart of the military review and the military presence.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you, Senator Feingold.\nSenator Lugar?\nLUGAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Clinton, when the Albanians informed the United States in the summer of 2004 that they saw some suspicious drums above Tirana and some of us went over there and found nerve gas and MANPAD missiles in sheds and what have you, and we're grateful to the Albanians seeking that assistance, this was the first opportunity for the Nunn- Lugar Act to go outside of Russia and the former states that comprised the former Soviet Union.\nI mention this because it created quite a problem bureaucratically. I had to get Secretary Powell's signature on a piece of paper and take another piece to the president himself to eradicate the situation.\nBut when Senator Obama first came to the committee, we traveled to Russia and Ukraine, saw additional MANPAD missiles and, in fact, a whole acreage of weapons that were very dangerous, although not weapons of mass destruction, and we secured Senate assistance in passing the proliferation security initiative and other bills.\nI bring all this to your attention because despite all this legislative effort, there has been no translation of this into increased financial or leadership commitment in the State Department.\nAdmittedly, budget constraints, problems of organization in the department, but nevertheless, all this became almost individual diplomacy rather than a concerted effort by our country.\nAnd the problem now is that we have found that there are dangerous pathogens and disease repositories in other countries in need of WMD proliferation prevention assistance.\nCan you describe, even in these early days of your study of this, what sort of an effort, under your leadership, the State Department may be able to offer to begin to do those things which are clearly diplomatic? That is, to open up conversations with other countries, to work with the Defense Department, of course, the Department of Energy, others who have interest in this, but which thus far the State Department has been either a reluctant or almost nonexistent partner.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Lugar, I don't think there is a more important issue that confronts the incoming administration and your leadership and inspiration with respect to arms control and especially nonproliferation and the effort to contain and destroy loose nukes and other material and now moving into the pathogen area, which is particularly dangerous, is a great example to me of what we should be doing.\nIt won't surprise you to know that in my transition review of the department, it became clear that the arms control and nonproliferation functions had been significantly degraded.\nThere was a difference of opinion within this current administration as to whether such an effort is worthwhile, whether it pays off, whether it's just spinning wheels.\nI heard someone in the administration previously say, \"Well, you know, we don't need this agreements because good people don't need them and bad people won't follow them.\"\nAnd so the infrastructure for being able to back you up when you went to Albania was severely undermined.\nWe intend to build it even more robustly. I am seeking arms control and nonproliferation experts to come back into the department. This is one of the passionate concerns of the president-elect, who, I think, under your tutelage, understands very much the threats that we face.\nSo I believe, Senator, that you will find a very willing and active partner in these efforts.\nI remember, when I met with you, looking at the pictures that you have displayed in your conference room of all of the various trips you've made, looking for this material, seeing it finally destroyed, and you know better than I how much more work lies ahead and, unfortunately, the bad guys are always at it. They're always going to be testing us.\nSo to that end, we will have a very strong commitment to the START treaty negotiation. We want to get out of the box early. We want Russia to know that we are serious.\nI take to heart what the chairman said about trying to reduce our numbers even lower. This incoming president, like all presidents, has been committed to the end of nuclear weapons, as long as we can be assured that we have adequate deterrents and that we are protected going forward.\nSo we're going to enter it with that frame of mind, which is quite a change.\nIn the nonproliferation area, I want to do everything I can, working with you, working with former Senator Nunn, to see what authorities we need, how we can better beef them up, how we can better fund them, use this occasion even to invite some of the technical experts and others who have left the government over the last eight years to reenlist, because it is true that you could make the case that bad actors won't follow agreements.\nYou can look at North Korea, you can look at Iran, but I think those should be the exception and not the rule. There should be a rules-based framework for arms control and nonproliferation; that if the United States once again leads and constructs that architecture, we will be in a stronger position to isolate the bad actors.\nSo I hope, Senator, that you will take my remarks as the invitation they're meant to be for collaboration, not just consultation, as we rebuild this function, staff it, and fund it appropriately.\nLUGAR: This is very good news. In a visit that I had with Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia and Mr. Kiriyenko of Rosatom in mid- December, I know they would welcome your words today, because there have certainly been some doubts on the Russian side as to where we were and the time is wasting. And so your leadership will be very much appreciated.\nLet me pursue a second line of questioning. At the Riga NATO summit in 2006, I gave a speech suggesting that Article 5 of NATO was violated just as severely when someone cut off natural gas and that's plunged a country either into the cold in the middle of the winter, where people would die and industry would founder, as when tanks and aircraft and what have you come across the border.\nBehind the scenes, the foreign minister said, \"Of course, you're right, but we don't talk about this publicly. We try to deal behind the barn as best we can with an intractable situation.\"\nAnd now we are still in the process of coming out of another crisis of this variety. The United States has fostered the Nabucco Pipeline as a prospect of helping either our NATO partners or our EU partners, if Europeans prefer to deal with the EU in this problem.\nBut the fact is Europeans have not dealt with it very positively. The prospects for some grid underneath Europe in which natural gas or other power might be spread has been very halting because of nationalistic boundaries, and, on occasion, you have a feeling we are more worried about the Europeans' energy problems than some of them are.\nI ask you this because this is a major diplomatic problem, our working with the NATO allies, with the EU, with the energy community in general, but I also come to ask if you agree that if we do not solve this problem at some point, our NATO allies are going to be rendered, if not impotent, at least in a position in which the NATO alliances weaken severely and perhaps the EU likewise, with the new members especially seeing acute pain and watching Georgia feeling a real problem in terms of their physical existence.\nWould you make a comment on this proposition?\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Lugar, I think, once again, you're demonstrating your farsighted realistic understanding of security threats, because I agree with. I think we have learned the hard way that the OPEC cartel is not just a commercial enterprise, but a security, geopolitical, strategic effort that we have had to contend with now for 36 years.\nAs you know, Russia is attempting to create a gas equivalent of OPEC that would give it, in addition to the bilateral powers it has, a much greater multilateral international reach on gas.\nSo this whole question of energy security, I think, has enormous implications for our country, for Europe, but, indeed, for the entire world.\nI'm also aware that you authored a provision in the last energy bill to have a coordinator on these energy security issues in the State Department. I intend to fulfill that.\nWe've had individual envoys on specific pipeline issues, but we haven't brought it all together in a way that I think reflects the elevated seriousness of the challenges that are being posed.\nSpecifically with respect to Russia and its interactions with Ukraine, Georgia, other European countries, its recent purchase of the Serbian gas utility, I hope we can make progress with our friends in NATO and the EU to understand that we do need a broader framework in which we can talk about energy security issues.\nIt may or may not be Article 5, but I think it certainly is a significant security challenge that we ignore at our peril.\nSo I will look, again, for advice and consultation, ideas you might have. We will be going to Europe in the due course on foreign ministers meetings, on the NATO anniversary meeting.\nCLINTON: This should be on the agenda and I hope that we can find willing partners to make it so.\nLUGAR: Thank you very much.\nKERRY: Thanks very much, Senator Lugar.\nSenator Boxer?\nBOXER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Clinton, I'm so excited to see you here today. As you know, I was very much in favor of your saying yes to this opportunity.\nYou're a dedicated public servant, and I think by nominating you President-elect Obama has sent a message that world peace and stability trumps politics and ego. And I think by accepting this position, Senator Clinton, you are sending the same message, because you are working with your toughest rival, and you've set your ego aside for world peace, world stability and for the good of the country. I mean that sincerely. You know I do.\nI wanted to pick off a few of the issues that I care about. I'm going to do it very quickly because there are so many -- just to make my voice heard on those -- and then ask you a question on a topic you raised, and we've discussed it before, the status of women in the world -- in particular, violence against women in the world. And Nicholas Kristof has written a series of articles on this, and I've spoken with our great new chairman, and I think his concern certainly lies in this direction along with yours.\nSo let me just say you face unbelievable challenges, you and the president-elect. Six years later, we still have 140,000 troops in Iraq. Seven years later, after the brutal attack of 9/11, we're fighting a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Al Qaida poses a great threat to us on that safe haven border of the Afghan-Pakistan border. The outrageous terrorist attack in Mumbai significantly heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.\nAnd the outbreak of violence in Gaza reminds us that Israel continues to face grave threats to its very existence from never- ending rocket attacks. Our leadership is sorely needed there to protect the innocent, not just in the short term but in the long term where we hope to seek a very good solution for all sides.\nIn Iran we face defiance, in North Korea the same. And due to our own inaction, we continue to be dependent on oil and gas whose revenues line the pockets of hostile regimes. And this dependence has slowed our fight against global warming.\nAnd I'm so proud that you mentioned global warming in your talk and that Senator Kerry, our chairman, is going to be so dedicated to helping you lead the charge in terms of a solution internationally. And as chairman of the Environment Committee, I will be by his side in that international treaty issue.\nHIV, AIDS, tuberculosis -- Africa, Asia, Latin America need our attention.\nSo that's the list, and now I want to get to my questions.\nI have a few pictures to share with all of us. And they're brutal pictures. And I'm not showing them for shock value. I want to show them because I don't think we can look away from the plight in women in the world.\nAnd as I said, Nicholas Kristof confronts these issues in a series of compelling articles. In one, he tells us about the recent acid attack against young girls in Afghanistan, where they're going to school with their teachers. And we have a photo of one of the victims to show you on that. I'm just going to do these very quickly. OK.\nHe profiles a story in a second picture, I'll show that, of a Pakistani woman who was viciously burned by her husband with acid because she dared to divorce him. This is what we're talking about. This is Ms. Azar. OK.\nThousands of women have suffered similar attacks throughout Asia, and no prosecutions, senator. Kristof tells us the story of a Vietnamese girl named Sina Vann who was kidnapped at age 13; she was sold into sex slavery in Cambodia. When she refused to see customers, she was tortured brutally with electric shocks and locked in a coffin full of insects.\nAnd Kristof illustrates an act of horrific brutality in a piece called \"If This Isn't Slavery, What Is?\" in which a young Cambodian girl had her eye gouged out by her brothel owner after taking time off to recover from a forced abortion. This is a picture of that, just very beautiful, young woman.\nSo I'm introducing some legislation. One is a companion piece of Representative Carolyn Maloney. Another one is the Afghan Women Empowerment Act, which many on this committee have worked with us on. And that's just the beginning. No woman or girl should ever have to live in fear or face persecution for being born female.\nAnd, senator, I know how deeply you feel about this. And so I wanted you to take a little more time to talk about your commitment to this particular issue. And, obviously, I would be so pleased if you would commit to help us work on a legislation to fight this immorality.\nCLINTON: Well, senator, you have been such a leader. And I have been honored to be your colleague and your partner in a number of these efforts that have been undertaken on behalf of women around the world.\nAnd I want to pledge to you that as secretary of state I view these issues as central to our foreign policy, not as adjunct or auxiliary or in any way lesser than all of the other issues that we have to confront.\nI, too, have followed the stories that are exemplified by the pictures that you held up. I mean, it is heartbreaking beyond works that, you know, young girls are attacked on their way to school by Taliban sympathizers and members who do not want young women to be educated. It's not complicated: They want to maintain an attitude that keeps women, as I said in my testimony, unhealthy, unfed, uneducated.\nAnd this is something that results all too often in violence against these young women, both within their families and from the outside. This is not culture. This is not custom. This is criminal. And it will be my hope to persuade more governments, as I have attempted to do since I spoke at Beijing on these issues, you know, 13 and some years ago, that we cannot have a free, prosperous, peaceful, progressive world if women are treated in such a discriminatory and violent way.\nI have also read closely Nick Kristof's articles over the last many months, but in particular the last weeks, on the young women that he has both rescued from prostitution and met who have been enslaved and abused, tortured in every way: physically, emotionally, morally.\nAnd I take very seriously the function of the State Department to lead our government through the Office on Human Trafficking to do all that we can to end this modern form of slavery. We have sex slavery, we have wage slavery, and it is primarily a slavery of girls and women.\nSo I look also forward, senator, to reviewing your legislation and working with you as a continuing partnership on behalf of these issues we care so much about.\nAnd finally, the work that the women of the Senate did in connection with First Lady Laura Bush on behalf of the women of Afghanistan has been extremely important. That program was started in the State Department. It was midwifed by a group that I helped to start back in the Clinton administration called Vital Voices. Mrs. Bush has been outspoken on behalf of the plight of Afghan women, on behalf of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, and other women facing oppression around the world. And I'm very pleased that that project will be spun off to Georgetown where it will continue under Mrs. Bush's sponsorship.\nSo we're going to have a very active women's office, a very active office on trafficking. We're going to be speaking out consistently and strongly against discrimination and oppression of women and slavery in particular, because I think that is in keeping not only with American values, as we all recognize, but American national security interests as well.\nBOXER: Well, I couldn't have asked for a better answer.\nI wanted to note, Mr. Chairman, that even the most conservative historians have said that if women in the world could be allowed to live up to their potential it would bring the whole world forward. A lot of the problems we face really come from this mindset that half of the population doesn't matter and can be abused. And they're ignored or hurt and can't contribute. So I think it's a key matter.\nSo I'll stop there and just say how much I appreciate your comments, not only on this subject but everything you've spoken about. It shows your breadth of understanding, in the same way with my chairman, who -- I mean, I think we have a team that's just extraordinary. And I'm proud. I hope to play a small role in that team.\nThank you.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nKERRY: Senator Boxer, thank you. Thanks for that important line of inquiry.\nAnd let me just say that Senator Boxer has talked to me personally about how the committee might focus on this. And I'm determined that the committee will. We obviously have, with Lisa Murkowski and Jeanne Shaheen, who will be joining the committee, an important nucleus. But I think that all of the other members of the committee share a concern and passion about this. So we will find a way to appropriately work with the secretary and see if we can't augment our international efforts on this.\nLet me just say as I introduce Senator Voinovich -- speaking for the members of the committee and myself, I know -- we are saddened by your decision. We're going to work the hell out of you over the course of the next two years to get the most we can. We're delighted that you are a member of this committee, and we appreciate enormously the many contributions that you make. So prepare for -- you're not going to cruise these last few years.\nSenator Voinovich?\nVOINOVICH: You know, one of the reasons why I'm not running is that I want to devote my full time to these...\nKERRY: There you go.\nVOINOVICH: ... historic problems that we have. And how we handle them during the next two years will have a great impact on the future of our country and the world.\nFirst of all, I want to thank you for the time we spent on the telephone and also for your receiving a very lengthy letter from me. And for the record, I'd like to just give the categories: management of the State Department; visa waiver; fighting global anti-Semitism; Israel; United Nations management; Security Council, their anti-Israel bias; enforcement of 1701, which we're both familiar with; stability and security in Europe; U.S.-Serbia relationships; Kosovo; NATO expansion; Russia; Canada and U.S. relations.\nThe thing I'd like to spend some time on is management. And I think Senator Corker did a pretty good job of outlining his concern about management of the department. But I think from a big picture point of view we have, if we can all work together on a bipartisan basis, an absolutely wonderful opportunity to really change the image of the United States of America.\nAnd we all know that our public diplomacy is at a low ebb. I think Secretary Rice has tried to do a good job in the last couple of years in terms of multilateralism. But, you know, once the water goes over the dam, it's hard to bring it back up.\nAnd I think that the Obama policy, \"smart power\" -- I was in Europe this last month, and they're all excited about our new president. And I think we all ought to be excited about the new national security team. Jim Jones, I had him wax about what he thinks we should do a couple years ago in Brussels at the German Marshall Fund meeting that they had. And I said, \"Why can't we get this guy into this administration? He's got the right idea.\" And then you've got Gates, who's got the right idea. You have the idea.\nAnd so this smart power is something that we really need to focus on. I would be interested in your reaction to the recommendations of Joe Nye and Dick Armitage in terms of smart power.\nThe other issue, of course, is when you get into the management of the department, I think you're getting Jack Lew in there and Steinberg doing the policy. And the fact that you recognize that you're going to putting out a lot of fires, and somebody's going to have to be working on this stuff from a day-to-day basis, it's important. But I think your recognition also of priorities -- prioritizing your time, where you're going to spend your time, who's going to do that -- the management here is extremely important.\nAnd I sent to you -- and I don't know whether you read it or not -- but the American Academy of Public Diplomacy has come out with a foreign affairs budget for the future. And for the record, it finds that the secretary lacks the tools, people, competencies, authorities, programs and funding to meet U.S. foreign policy demands effectively. And it talks about hiring another 4,000 people from 2010 to 2014.\nVOINOVICH: Again, I'd be interested either hearing from you about if you've read it or what you think about it. I haven't met personally yet with Jack Lew, but I definitely intend to do it. And I want the chairman to know that, whether I'm on this committee or not, I'm going to stay on this management thing as a ranking member of the oversight of government management and the federal workforce. And I may be on appropriations and foreign policy.\nIt's a big deal that I think really need to get done. So what are your thoughts on that?\nCLINTON: Well, first, Senator, I thank you for your emphasis on workforce issues, management issues, better utilization of resource issues. That's been a hallmark of your service first in Ohio and now, of course, in the Senate. And so I welcome your involvement and your ideas as we go forward.\nI want to say a word about your reference to smart power because, clearly, that is what the Obama administration and I will try to do. It is a recognition that it shouldn't be an either-or debate. Either we use military force and all of the strength and power that we have or we use diplomacy and development.\nWe want to marry those because we think that will give us a more effective foreign policy for your country. And, you know, General Jones is a perfect example. You know that he was asked by President Bush and Secretary Rice to work in the Middle East. And starting in December 2007, that's exactly what he did working with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Defense Force to build up security in the West Bank.\nAnd I think the results were very promising with sustained bottoms-up effort day in and day out working to bridge gaps of understanding and trust, there was a turnover of security from the Israelis to the Palestinians which is, you know, still, as of this moment, holding. And that is the work that General Jones and General Dayton and others that he was involved with have been done. And we're going to continue that kind of approach.\nVOINOVICH: One of the...\nCLINTON: So smart power is the combined tools we have.\nVOINOVICH: Yes. One of the things that I'm concerned about is the turf. And you've got Susan Rice going to the United Nations. She's going to become a part of the Cabinet. And I hope that there's a lot of discussion given about whose responsible for what and a recognition that there will be times where you'll all be stepping on each other's toes but that you're doing it for the best interests of the team.\nI think that that's very, very important. The worst thing that we can have would be that something come out and say that we've got a conflict there.\nI'd like to switch to another issue that I'm very interested in. And that is -- and you haven't really mentioned it. It's the issue of energy independence and its impact on our foreign policy. And as you know, for years, we were on the Environment and Public Works Committee and I talked about harmonizing the environment, our energy, our economy, and national security.\nAnd on this trip to Europe, I was frightened when I found out the influence that Russia is having in terms of natural gas, including, Great Britain. And I thought to myself this threat of being cut off is going to have an influence on their decision making. And it's extreme the important that we not be, you know, in the hands of somebody else in terms of our energy.\nAnd I'm wondering have you thought about that aspect of it? Now, climate change is very much a part of this.\nCLINTON: Right.\nVOINOVICH: But it seems to me that we ought to really raise the issue of energy independence in terms of our national security and also being able to make the right decisions in the world when some of our allies may not be able to because they're frightened that somebody's going to shut off their gas.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, the president-elect and I could not agree more with your point of view. It's one of the reasons why the president-elect has talked about an energy partnership for Latin America, looking to find ways through technology and other activities we can work together to become more energy independent in this hemisphere.\nAnd, of course, we have problems in our own hemisphere with some of the providers of energy, like Hugo Chavez. So -- and, you know, President Morales. We have problems even in this hemisphere with countries feeling, you know, somewhat worried about what will happen with their energy supplies.\nAs you and Senator Lugar have pointed out, that becomes even more acute in Europe. So I think this deserves a lot of attention. It is part of the climate change agenda, but it also deserves separate attention.\nAnd to that end, I will follow the recommendation of the legislation that Senator Lugar passed which says we should have someone coordinating energy security issues in the State Department to work with the Europeans, to work with others to try to come up with ways that we can both promote energy independence so they're not so vulnerable but also try to help equip them with ways of dealing with their current vulnerabilities, particularly to Russia.\nBecause I see this as a big security challenge. And, you know, I know of your longstanding interest in Serbia. And, you know, with the purchase of the gas company in Serbia by Gazprom, it -- there is some concern on the part of the Serbians. Well, what's going to happen to their gas supply? Are they going to be kind of a pawn in whatever the larger Russian ambitions are about energy?\nSo this is a very timely issue, and it should go hand in hand with our climate change work.\nVOINOVICH: Well, I hope that because the cost of gasoline has gone down that we're all going to just sit back like we did in 1973 and just say everything's going to be fine. Because it's not going to be fine. And I would really hope that you and your team would give a great deal of consideration to how do we become energy independent, meaning, I'd like to say, find more, use less, and then the international dimension of this that -- in terms of public diplomacy to get the other folks in the world that are emitting greenhouse gases to come together in a unique way to say we're going to do this as a team rather than us coming up with the technology and then forcing it down their throat.\nCLINTON: Well, I think the chairman, who's had a longstanding interest in this, knows that, as we move toward Copenhagen and attempt to craft a climate change agreement, all the major nations must be part of it. You know, China, India, Russia, and others, they have to be part of whatever agreement we put forth.\nAnd I think, as I say, this can be both included in but also independently given attention to by emphasizing energy security which I intend to do.\nVOINOVICH: Thank you.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator.\nSenator Nelson?\nNELSON: Senator Clinton, I have just a couple of questions. But I want to say at the outset that this senator thinks that your husband's Clinton Global Initiative is an extremely positive thing to haven in a relationship with the future secretary of state.\nThe fact that the Global Initiative has done such good things all over the world, the anti-viral drugs and the dispensing, the working on poverty and hunger, the fact of promoting development in the third world, I think, is a significant accomplishment and that can only lend additional credibility to your coming to the table as the foreign policy representative of the United States government.\nI want that on the record.\nNow, I want to pick up on something that Senator Boxer had said. I had the privilege of our subcommittee on this committee of chairing the hearings about rapes of American contractor women in Iraq and Afghanistan. And what we found in dramatic testimony from very courageous women that came forth and testified to the committee was that there was always an attempt among State Department contractor personnel -- and that, of course, was the jurisdictional hook through our Foreign Relations Committee. But the same applied to contractor personnel in the Department of Defense.\nAlways, the attempt to sweep it under the rug, not have it conveyed to the U.S. attorneys for the proper prosecution. When we got this out in the open, we have tried to encourage the cooperation and collaboration between those three departments -- Justice, Defense, and State.\nI bring it out for your consideration. Now, let me just raise just a couple of questions.\nBecause of the beneficence of this committee in allowing me to travel a good part of the third world of this planet, there's such poverty and disease, but we come right back to this hemisphere. And the poorest nation in this hemisphere is Haiti. Please keep your eye on Haiti.\nSenator Clinton, you've already been briefed on this, but one of the things that you're going to face is there is an American that is missing in Iran. Because that is a Floridian and because he has left behind a wife and seven children, I have gone to the Iranian ambassador at the United Nations who will see me even though his government will not allow him to talk to our UN ambassador.\nHe operates under the fiction that he will see me because I'm a representative of the people of the state of Florida. But the door has been closed at every turn. What I have said to him -- and I speak through the lens of this committee hearing -- that out of human compassion this is a great opportunity for the country of Iran to crack the door because we think he is being held by the government of Iran in a secret prison in Iran. And if we want to have some renewed relations, this is a good first opportunity.\nThen I would just ask you -- we've basically had a lack of a vigorous policy toward Latin America. And what a great opportunity for the Obama administration. In the memory of President Kennedy's vigorous Latin American policy, the Alliance For Progress, do you have any thoughts on that?\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Nelson, you've covered a number of important issues. And let me start with your question about Latin America.\nI have a lot of thoughts about that. And I think you're right. It is a tremendous opportunity, and I look forward, on behalf of the president-elect and working with members of Congress who have a particular concern and interest in Latin America, to making it abundantly clear that the Obama administration is seeking partnerships and friendships across Latin America. We're looking forward with great anticipation to the Summit of the Americas that will be held in April. We want to, you know, not only respond to the issues that are in the headlines, as the president-elect did yesterday with President Calderon -- issues of security, issues of criminality and narco- trafficking and the like. But we want to seize the opportunities in Latin America, which is why the energy partnership that the president- elect has suggested that's so much potential.\nThe countries of Latin America are really our closest allies. If you look at trade, if you look at familial relationships, you can see all of these connections. And I think that we're going to put a new face on American diplomacy as we reach out to Latin America.\nThat is particularly a mission of mine, and I share your concern about Haiti. It is, as you say, one of the poorest nations in the world -- the poorest in our hemisphere. I hope that we can have a comprehensive approach that could alleviate the suffering the people of Haiti. And I look forward to working with you on that.\nCLINTON: With respect to the Floridian who is in prison, it would be an extraordinary opportunity for the government of Iran to make such a gesture to permit contact, to release him, to make it clear that there is a new attitude in Iran, as we believe there will be with the Obama administration toward engagement, carefully constructed, and with very clear outcomes attempted.\nNELSON: His name is Bob Levinson.\nCLINTON: That's right.\nAnd, you know, Senator, on contractors, this is going to be a big issue for this committee. We have seen the abuses by contractors, but even when there are not headline-grabbing abuses, there has been a steady transfer of authority and resources from government employees and a chain of accountability to contractors, and we have reaped the very difficult consequences of that. We -- we know, obviously, of the security contractors and some of the difficulties that they have presented, but it's been contractors across the board.\nWe have used so many of them, particularly in Iraq, but not exclusively, and I think we have to take a hard look at whether we want the U.S. government to turn into a contracting agency or whether we're going to be smart about using our resources because, in most instances, contracting out a job costs more than keeping it in-house and building up expertise and experience and imposing accountability. So I look forward to working with you and your subcommittee to try to determine what we can do about contractors.\nBut I would just end on this cautionary note. The chairman asked me about the role of the State Department in Iraq. We're going to try to fulfill any of the pledges we've made in the agreement of friendship and cooperation. Our civilian employees need to be protected. As we withdraw our troops, we have to be absolutely assured that they will be protected by the Iraqis, or we have to use contracts, or we have to wonder whether we can send them out to the countryside if there is still the threat of violence.\nSo this has a direct effect on how we're going to perform our diplomatic responsibilities inside Iraq and other countries.\nKERRY: Thank you, Senator Nelson.\nSenator Murkowski?\nMURKOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome to you, Senator Clinton. Thank you for your leadership, for your willingness to -- to step forward and assume this very, very important position for our country, for the nation. I truly appreciate all that you are poised to do and what you have done in the past.\nWe had an opportunity in my office last week to -- to discuss an issue that is, I think, vitally important to this country, and that is our role as an Arctic nation, and I know oftentimes my colleagues don't view the United States as an Arctic nation, but we are by virtue of Alaska, and we have opportunities, when it comes to a leadership role, in collaboration on research, on environmental issues, on issues as they relate to commerce, and we're seeing more of those issues present themselves as we see a world out there that is more and more free of sea ice.\nThe loss of summer sea ice from climate change is having a truly dramatic effect on the Arctic, and the Bush administration saw this unfolding. We've been working with them for -- for about the past 18 months to advance a new Arctic policy. Our Arctic policy is about 15 years stale. That was just released on Friday. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to fully review it.\nBut I'd like your comments here this morning on the evolving role of the Arctic, on the role that we can play as an Arctic nation in dealing with our neighbors. We discussed the issue of Russia, and at some -- oftentimes, we've got some very difficult relationships with their -- them, but the opportunity that -- on -- on issues as they relate to research and an evolving world up north, how that might play out, and if you could just speak to that issue this morning.\nI -- I have missed most of your comments this morning, and I apologize for that. I've been in two other confirmation hearings, but I'm pretty certain that you haven't fielded yet a question on the Arctic.\nCLINTON: And, Senator, it's very timely that one has been raised because, as I -- as I had said to you before and -- and even when you and your husband hosted Senator McCain's CODEL when we were in Alaska and saw for ourselves some of the changes that are going on in the Arctic, both on land and in the sea, you have been a leader on this issue, and I hope your time has come, Senator, because I believe that the issues of the Arctic are one of those long-term matters that will dramatically effect our commercial, our environmental, our energy futures that we have got to start attending to now.\nSo, to that end, I agree with you completely that the issues that are posed by the recent Bush administration report that did come out just a few days ago, the work of the Arctic Council that has been an attempt to try to summon the best thinking of the government and outside experts will find a very receptive ear in the State Department. I think President-elect Obama and I see that this is one of those areas that offers a chance for cooperation that might lead not only to positive actions with respect to the Arctic, but deepen our partnerships with Russia and others across the board. So, to that end, we will be working to try to sort through the recommendations and the ideas in the recent reports to see how we fit that in to already existing frameworks and consider what additional actions and positions might be necessary, but I agree with you completely. You know, maybe because the change has been relatively rapid with the melting of the sea ice, people haven't kept up with what is going on in the Arctic, and I -- when I was in your office and you were telling me about how cruise ships now are going to Point Barrow, I was shocked.\nMURKOWSKI: So were the people at Point Barrow. So were the people at Point Barrow! I mean, look on the map. It's the northernmost place in the United States, and it's not a place that one would have thought previously was on the tour for cruise ships.\nCLINTON: We know that there's going to be a necessity to map out our continental shelf. We know that there will be disputes over energy resources and minerals and other natural resources in the Arctic. To go along with that, I -- I know that hand in hand with concerns about the Arctic is, you know, the Oceans Convention, the Law of the Sea, which would clarify a lot of the problems that you're going to face in Alaska if we don't have a national Arctic policy that also includes what our international position is on the oceans, and I think...\nMURKOWSKI: Will ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty be a priority for you?\nCLINTON: Yes, it will be, and it will be because it is long overdue, Senator. The Law of the Sea Treaty is supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, environmental, energy, and business interests. I have spoken with some of our -- our naval leaders, and they consider themselves to be somewhat disadvantaged by our not having become a party to the Law of the Sea.\nOur industrial interests, particularly with seabed mining, just shut up. I mean, there's nothing that they can do because there's no protocol that they can feel comfortable that gives them the opportunity to pursue commercial interests. So, for all of those reasons -- and I mention it in conjunction with the Arctic because I think they go hand in hand -- we've got to figure out where our boundaries are. You know, if people start drilling in areas that are now ice free most of the year, and we don't know where they can and can't drill or whether we can, we're going to be disadvantaged. So I think that you will have a very receptive audience in our State Department and in our administration.\nMURKOWSKI: Well, I'm -- I'm very pleased, very encouraged to hear that and truly look forward to the opportunity to be working with you to advance these -- these very important issues, and -- and as we look to some of the basics that we're lacking up in the Arctic, whether it's the -- the capacity for search or rescue, you know, what -- what -- what we need to be prepared for in this -- in this ever- evolving world without borders, it's quite a concept to think.\nOne -- one more question, another that Alaskans look to with great interest because of our proximity to North Korea: As we look to the hot spots in the world, we certainly appreciate all of the other threats that you will be dealing with as secretary of state, but you kind of get most nervous about those that are more proximate to you, and North Korea is certainly to us.\nIn that vein, what do you see the future of the six-party talks under -- under your tenure -- how do you anticipate that you'll be able to -- whether it's jumpstart the process or -- how do you see that moving forward?\nCLINTON: Senator, I've had several lengthy conversations with Secretary Rice who has brought me up to date on the status of the six- party talks. It is a framework that the president-elect and I believe has merit, but it also provides an opportunity, as Secretary Rice has testified before this committee, for bilateral contacts as well between North Korea and the United States.\nAgain, this is under review. We're looking at all of the record of the negotiation up to this date. Our goal is to end the North Korean nuclear program, both the plutonium reprocessing program and the highly enriched uranium program which there is reason to believe exists, although never quite verified, and it is our strong belief that the six-party talks, particularly the role that China is currently playing, along with our close allies South Korea and Japan, is a vehicle for us to exert pressure on North Korea in a way that is more likely to alter their behavior.\nAgain, I have no illusions about that. I think it takes tough reality-based diplomacy to determine what is doable. We have got to end North Korea as a proliferator. There is certainly reason to believe that North Korea has been involved with Syrian efforts. We know that it was involved with Libyan efforts. So it's not only preventing the threat from North Korea, which is of particular interest to Hawaii, Alaska, and the West Coast of the United States, but it is their role as a proliferator.\nSo we will -- we will embark upon a very aggressive effort to try to determine the best way forward to achieve our objectives with them.\nMURKOWSKI: Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your, again, willingness and -- and your great capacity (inaudible) effort. Appreciate it.\nKERRY: Thank you, Senator Murkowski.\nLet me just say to you and to others interested that we are already -- I have talked to Senator Lugar about this, and I've talked to Senator Clinton about it. We will be -- we are now laying the groundwork for and expect to try to take up the Law of the Sea Treaty. So that will be one of the priorities of -- of the committee, and the key here is just timing, how we proceed.\nSenator Cardin? CARDIN: Well, first, Senator Kerry, let me -- let me tell you how proud all of us are to serve on this committee, particularly with you as our chairman. We're -- we're looking forward to this time and know the challenges are great, and we thank you for stepping forward as chairman of the committee.\nKERRY: Pleasure.\nCARDIN: And to Senator Clinton, thank you. Thank you for being willing to do this, your entire family. I -- I know it was a difficult decision. I know how much you love being a senator from New York, and we just thank you for stepping forward. The issues are so difficult in this country, and it couldn't be a better person to represent our nation, and we thank you for doing that.\nWe had a chance to talk about several issues when you were in my office over the weekend, and your opening statement and your responses to questions have covered much of the area. Particularly I want to just underscore the challenge you're going to have in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and I think you have covered that in your statement and in your response.\nI want to deal first with another void that you've created in the United States Senate because of your selection as secretary of state. Now, obviously, it's going to be a void for the people of New York as you leave that Senate seat, but also the Helsinki Commission which you serve as an active member and you've been a very valuable member of the commission. I will have the honor of chairing the commission during these next two years.\nAnd, as you know, it was established as the U.S. arm to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, created in 1975 with President Ford, as a way to engage Europe on security issues, on economic issues, and on human rights. It's perhaps best known for its work in the former Soviet Union when it spoke up to the human rights violations and led to changes within the Soviet Union. In recent years, it's been very helpful on creating a strategy in Europe to deal with anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination.\nCARDIN: It has been actively involved on the human trafficking issues, and we've had discussions here today about necessities to monitor not only the activities from those countries that -- where the women -- and they're usually women and children -- come from, but also the receiving countries and to deal with the problems.\nAnd we now have a reporting issue within the State Department to see how well countries are doing on trafficking and a lot of that work came out of the Helsinki Commission. And the list goes on and on and on.\nMy point or request to you is that I that the OSCE and the U.S. involvement through the Helsinki Commission can be a valuable tool in your game plan on dealing with the policy objectives of the United States, whether it's engaging Russia, and Russia, as you know, is an active member of OSCE, or whether it's dealing with global climate change or whether it's dealing with refugee issues.\nAnd I would just urge you to challenge us as to how the OSCE can be more effective in dealing with your game plan for foreign policy of this country.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Cardin, it's been an honor to serve on the Helsinki Commission and I know you have not only a longstanding interest, but involvement, going back to your days in the House, with respect to OSCE and the Helsinki accords.\nAnd when you and I were talking, we briefly discussed how history sometimes plays out, because at the time of the Helsinki accords, then President Ford was urged by both the right and the left not to go and negotiate those, that they would not be a good idea, and he very courageously said that he was going to go forward, because any opportunity to negotiate, to try to set up a framework for human rights was in America's interest.\nAnd we now can look back and see how President Ford's vision which led to the Helsinki accords, which, obviously, the former Soviet Union was a party to, actually contributed to the eventual breakup of the Soviet Union, because it gave legitimacy and voice to people who were dissidents and had human rights complaints.\nSo I think this work must continue. I look forward to figuring out ways that we can work together. And I also would appreciate any advice you would have about how the framework of OSCE and the Helsinki accords could be perhaps modernized and transported into the 21st century, with some of the problems that we see around the world today, because the problems are certainly different, but human nature isn't, and how we take advantage of diplomacy and agreement and setting goals on human rights will be a priority and doing that in service of outcomes, like what we saw with the Helsinki accords is what I'm interested in.\nCARDIN: And that's one of the highest priorities for us to evaluate how we can modernize the Helsinki Commission and the OSCE process.\nAnd we are fortunate to have representatives from the executive branch that serve on the commission with us. So we will do this in conjunction with your own views as to how you think we can best serve the objectives of this country.\nLet me mention one or two issues that are relevant to the human rights issues, but also relevant to the broader issues.\nThe refugee problem, particularly as it relates to Iraq, I mean, we hear a lot about how we're going to ultimately resolve the circumstances in Iraq.\nWhen you have five million displaced individuals, many of which are in other countries, it makes it extremely challenging to see a lasting solution in that region.\nSeveral Senators have sent a letter to President-elect Obama urging a White House office on refugee issues just so we can get the type of visibility we think on refugees.\nClearly, this is a high area of concern within the foreign policy in the State Department. I would welcome your involvement as to how we come to grips with the refugee crisis in that region.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, as you know, there is an office in the State Department -- population, migration and refugees. It's our intention to staff that with effective and creative professionals, because we agree that the refugee problem is growing worse in many places around the world.\nYou reference Iraq. One of the challenges of the Iraqi government and, insofar as we are involved, our government, in sort of balancing how we're going to support the stability of the Iraqi government and help them deal with the repatriation and return, both externally and internally, of Iraqis is a big challenge to the Iraqi government that we're conscious of.\nBut we have refugee populations, some of decades longstanding and some of a few days standing, in so many places. I will do my very best to elevate this issue, to give you the kind of expertise within the State Department that will give you comfort that we're going to make this a high priority, and to come up with solutions to some of our longstanding refugee challenges.\nThis is a very complex issue, because everywhere we look in the world, conflict, famine, disease, the economy, we have refugees. And so our hope is that we can get a more comprehensive strategy to deal with refugees, come to the Congress to get the funding for refugees, a problem which is compounded by the point that Senator Lugar made at the beginning of the hearing about the food crisis.\nSo I would welcome working with you and those who are concerned, as you are, to come up with an effective strategy for the United States to deploy with respect to refugees.\nCARDIN: Well, thank you very much for that answer.\nMany of us have been asking you questions on energy. Energy is a huge issue internationally and the State Department is going to have to play a critical role.\nWe've talked about the global climate change issues. We've talked about some of the conduct of other countries trying to stop energy from flowing between different countries.\nI want to talk about one other issue. We have a lot of mineral rich countries in which its citizens are very poor. We think that many of those revenues are going against U.S. security interests, funding activities that are against our country.\nThere is an effort made for transparency and extraction, so that we set up the model system for how a nation should handle how its mineral wealth is used for the benefit of the people of their own country.\nThe United States is participating in that discussion. I think we could be more aggressive in trying to move forward.\nWe've talked about foreign assistance and many of these countries that have mineral wealth are receiving foreign aid from the United States and we don't know where their mineral wealth is going.\nSo I just want to bring that to your attention and I think this is an area that we can make much further advancements in trying to help deal with the poverty around the world.\nCLINTON: Very creative suggestion, Senator, and we should look at the models of countries that have handled their mineral wealth to the advantage of their people. Botswana comes to mind. They've been very good stewards of their diamonds and have invested in roads and schools and infrastructure in Botswana.\nSo we should be looking for best practices and see if there is a way to create a regulatory framework that would give both protection and incentives to mineral rich countries so that they would be able to stand up for their rights and then use the revenues in a very positive way to enhance the well being of their people.\nCARDIN: Thank you very much, look forward to working with you.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nKERRY: Thanks a lot, Senator Cardin. Let me just say that given the time here, we're going to have two more rounds, do two more questioners, before we do the mandatory break at quarter of.\nAnd just for the knowledge of the press and others, and many of them are already aware of this, we have a very extensive questioning process that takes place prior even to our convening here, called \"questions for the record.\"\nAnd the committee has already submitted, just through the chair, over 138 questions and there were additional questions by other Senators, all of which have been answered by Senator Clinton, and we're very appreciative for the in-depth answers.\nWe know it's an enormous task and a lot of people have ground away on it, but we're very, very appreciative.\nWhat it does do is facilitate the hearings considerably and help us to sort of narrow the areas of inquiry that we need to do here now.\nWith that said, let me turn now to Senator DeMint.\nDEMINT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Lugar.\nAnd, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a longer list of questions that I will not have time to ask today.\nKERRY: Fine, but we are going to try to proceed forward. So we'll try to get those answered in the next 24 hours for you, Senator.\nDEMINT: Thank you very much.\nKERRY: Because we do have a business meeting scheduled for Thursday.\nDEMINT: Thank you.\nSenator Clinton, congratulations on your nomination. I appreciate your call. It's amazing what a little communication can do. So I feel a lot better about you already.\nI am optimistic and hopeful about your role as secretary of state and despite the news accounts that say that I'm the one that's going to ask you the hard questions about potential conflicts of interest, I have no questions about your integrity.\nI would support Senator Corker and others who support your nomination in appealing to you to do whatever is necessary to silence any critics before you take office. Enough said, as far as I'm concerned.\nThe State Department, over several administrations, has a mixed reputation, at best. In private, talking to military leaders, business people, international adoption agencies, independent aid workers, even foreign officials, I often hear the State Department is more of an obstacle than a help or mixed reviews, again, at best. We even have foreign governments calling our office and coming in to meet with us to want to bypass the State Department to develop better relations with our country, and I'm sure other members have experienced the same thing.\nSo the challenge is tremendous. You mentioned in your opening statement the many challenges all around the world, economic, human rights, and there is so much to do that it's mind-boggling.\nAnd with our economy and our debt and the domestic needs that we have and incredible levels of spending that we're experiencing now, it's very difficult to see an expanded role for America around the world, certainly one that has to be prioritized.\nAnd I would join with Senator Isakson and I'll paraphrase, but we need to be that city on the hill. I'm not sure that we can afford to build cities on the hill all around the country, although I hope we can play a role.\nWith so much to do, I just wanted to ask you to comment about other ways that we might can accomplish our goals.\nI've seen, as I've traveled and talked to people from around the world, that very often, business, trade, commerce is our best ambassador and even in difficult political times, when Germany and France are squabbling with the U.S., I have a Michelin headquarters and BMW headquarters in my district, business goes on and everybody gets along just fine despite the political wrangling.\nAnd we also see private charities, aid workers, missionaries doing so much good.\nHow do you see the role of the State Department in facilitating the good private sector things that are there without trying to replace them and maybe without trying to manage them?\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, I appreciate very much your posing this question, because I think it's a real opportunity for us if we can figure out how best to better coordinate and facilitate the private sector and the not-for-profit and religious community of the United States on behalf of humanitarian and commercial efforts.\nI think that the State Department has been reviewed in a mixed way for a number of years. In part, it's because the work of the State Department, both in diplomacy and development, is not as well understood and sometimes appears to be frustrating.\nI mean, trying to argue over where a comma goes or what the appropriate language would be and how to actually get to that treaty, it does raise, in the eyes of the American people, questions about, well, what is it we do.\nAnd I think we have a bigger job, which I will assume, of trying to explain to the American people why our national security depends on defense, diplomacy and development. Now, defense is primarily a government mission, as we know, and thank goodness for these young men and women and their commanders who wear the uniform of our country.\nDiplomacy is primarily a government mission, but there are lots of ways that nongovernment actors, like corporations, like religious organizations, like charities and foundations, are actually building relationships with foreign governments and foreign people all the time, which, if done in the right way, are really value added to who we are as a nation and what we can achieve.\nRight now, in Rwanda, a number of foundations, a number of churches, a number of private sectors actors are all working to try to build that country back up.\nSo I would hope that when we look at the State Department, we think of the role of foreign policy, diplomacy and development as involving not just those who are the foreign service officers and the civil service professionals and the development experts, but really it's all hands on deck.\nCLINTON: We have a lot of work to, in my view, kind of repair damage and get out there and -- and present America as we know we are.\nBut I don't think in this complex and dangerous world there is any substitute for the role of the State Department and USAID professionals. So it will be my undertaking to make this department as efficient as possible, so that you know you're getting your money's worth; to streamline it as much as possible.\nI mean, I will be frustrated, as you will be, if all we do is pile up paper. I want strategies. I want specific ideas. I want more partnerships. That's how I see the role of the State Department in the 21st century. That's how I hope that USAID will, you know, be revitalized to perform that role as well.\nBut the disparity of resources is such that when you've got more than 10 times the resources going to the Defense Department than you have going to the State Department and foreign aid, the Defense Department has been, in effect, recreating mini-State Departments.\nYou know, they're out doing development assistance and rule of law and other things. Why? Because, as I said earlier, they have a presumption of being able to move much more quickly. The money we give them is, in many respects, more flexible.\nSo I think we have to see how do we get what we want and what we're paying for out of our State Department and USAID. And I want to work closely with you and others on this committee. I want new ideas. I want best practices.\nBut I don't think there's any substitute for having seasoned, experienced professionals and experts sort of leading our efforts on diplomacy and development, and working, where possible, in partnership and coordination with the private sector and the not-for-profit sector.\nDEMINT: Thank you. I can see I'm not going to get to too many of my questions, but I'm -- I'll -- just a couple of concerns and one last question.\nJust as you're concerned about the disadvantage, difficulty, of women and children around the world, much the same can be said for religious persecution. Even in countries like Iraq that we're doing so much to -- so much sacrifice to free, Iraqi Christians can't come home. I would hope you would be sensitive to that. And also, we have spoken about Israel, and I think there's widespread agreement of our support there, but it appears to be naive and illogical to continue to -- diplomacy and calls for peace with governments that are publicly opposed to the existence of Israel. How we reconcile that is -- is very difficult.\nOne last concern, I think, and one difficulty that you will have is balancing protecting our sovereignty as a nation with international cooperation. I've seen with some of our agreements with the United Nations, the United States is going to bear the brunt of the expense and often the execution of -- of -- of what is -- the U.N. promises.\nThey don't back up their own resolutions, as in Iraq or now in Iran, North Korea. We submit and we -- and we complied and yield in many ways our decision-making to organizations like the United Nations, but then we're left holding the bag with what they don't do.\nAnd maybe in just a minute or so that I have left -- how can we do a better job of being cooperative, at the same time protecting our sovereignty?\nCLINTON: Well, I think the absolute bottom line for any agreement or undertaking by the United States government is that it has to be, in our view, in the best interest of the United States...\nDEMINT: Right.\nCLINTON: ... that it furthers our national security, advances our interests, and both protects and reflects our values. That's how I see my responsibility.\nI think there are ways that we can cooperate more than we have without in any way impinging upon our sovereignty, our identity or our security interests or values.\nBut I will remain very conscious of that, Senator, because two issues that you -- you mentioned -- religious persecution -- that's a -- you know, that -- that is anathema to Americans. I mean, we believe in the freedom to worship. And there is a -- an office in the State Department that is committed to religious freedom.\nBut I -- I believe that that is an area that we want to talk more about, that we want to raise, because of the significance.\nYou point out rightly that, you know, we've given a lot of aid and we've -- we've given a lot of blood on behalf of certain countries that -- that persecute not just Christians but people of other religious beliefs, even interfaith beliefs within the same denomination or particular view of religion.\nI think on Israel, you cannot negotiate with Hamas until it renounces violence, recognizes Israel and agrees to abide by past agreements. That is just, for me, a -- you know, an absolute. You know, that is the United States government's position. That is the president-elect's position. And finally, on the questions, we will turn those around in the next 24 hours, Senator. I know that the chairman and Senator Lugar submitted very thoughtful, extensive questions, and we responded to those, more than 300 of them.\nWe will take whatever other questions for the record any member has and turn those around within 24 hours, because I -- I want you to have as -- as comprehensive a record as possible for you to consider my nomination.\nDEMINT: Thank you very much.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Let me just shock your troops by telling you that, unfortunately, we have to, in order to move forward, close the record by 12 noon tomorrow, so...\nCLINTON: OK.\nKERRY: We'll get the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) out tonight.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLook at those smiles over there.\nCLINTON: Don't look too closely, because they haven't had a lot of sleep. They're not...\nKERRY: I'm confident...\nCLINTON: ... not looking too alert today.\nKERRY: Anyway. What we're going to do is Senator Menendez will close out the morning questioning, and then we'll come back.\nSenator Isakson, you'll lead off as close to 2 o'clock as possible. It's slightly dependent on someone else's schedule, but we'll -- we'll figure that out.\nWe'll go through the rest of the questioning, and then we'll have another round. We'll probably shorten the second round. But I think -- Senator Clinton and I have discussed this -- we are both prepared to stay here as late as necessary to try to get through it.\nThere are other areas of inquiry that I know a lot of us have, and there are some important subjects that we haven't yet touched on, so we need to expedite that if we can.\nSenator Menendez?\nMENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI want to start off by saying, Senator Clinton, I -- I appreciate the significant voluntary steps that go above and beyond the requirements of the law and ethics regulations that you have been willing to put forth.\nI think that they are exemplary and should answer a lot of people's concerns. And as I said, they're above and beyond the law and the ethics requirements, and I appreciate that.\nParticularly, I appreciate that even pledges and proposed contributions to the Clinton Foundation will be eligible for review by the deputy legal adviser and designated agency ethics official at the State Department. That, again, is above and beyond.\nAnd I think that that's the type of tone and tenor to set, and I want to salute you for -- for doing that.\nYou and I have had the conversation to talk about something I care about a great deal, which is foreign assistance. We've held -- been privileged in the last Congress to chair the Subcommittee on Foreign Assistance, and we've held a series of hearings on it.\nYou know, it's interesting to note that nearly a half a century ago, President Kennedy sent a letter to the Congress in which he said something that if we were to hear today would largely be the same.\nHe said the economic collapse of those free but less-developed nations which now stand poised between sustained growth and economic chaos would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience.\nHe said no objective supporter of foreign aid can be satisfied with the existing program. Actually, a multiplicity of programs -- bureaucratically fragmented, awkward, slow. Administration is diffused over a haphazard and irrational structure covering at least four departments and several other agencies.\nAnd he went to talk about the morale of those employees trying to pursue that. That was nearly a half a century ago, and in some respects I could say that that is a large degree of what we face today.\nSo as one of the most powerful tools of soft diplomacy, I'd like to hear -- you know, some of us are concerned. I -- I've heard about the designation of Mr. Lew as the deputy secretary of state for resources and management -- that he will be the advocate. You know, that's a broad title, lot of resources, lot of management.\nQuestion is, you know, how do we ensure that we elevate foreign assistance?\nHow do we ensure that we appoint a high-profile manager to lead that agency, a strong, independent voice for foreign assistance, building up the staff at AID, making sure that a lot of what's gone to the Defense Department by -- by -- simply by -- the lack of having an appropriate structure and effort at State comes back to State, where it really should be done, in cooperation with the Defense Department.\nGive us -- give me a -- a sense of confidence that under your leadership this is something that we're going to see pursued vigorously.\nCLINTON: Well, you have, you know, my commitment that it will be pursued vigorously. It is an area that I care deeply about. It is where much of my, you know, early public voluntary efforts were directed.\nAnd I am hopeful, Senator, that we're going to put in place a system that will, number one, rationalize what we have there now, and not only within the State Department and USAID, but as you know, there are pockets of foreign aid programs across the government that are technically under the coordination of the secretary, but are not really working together as they should.\nAnd -- and when we look at USAID, we've got to get a handle on the contracting out of functions and personnel. It leaves us without the capacity to respond to the many needs that we know are there.\nWhen we look at what's called the G function in the State Department, that's where you see population, migration and refugees and, you know, having served very happily in this body, I know how -- how it seems that if an issue of such importance as refugees is not getting attention, then let's put a coordinator in the White House, and maybe that'll get people's attention.\nBut of course, what we ought to be doing is making the existing State Department programs work effectively. We have PEPFAR, which has been very successful and is a great tribute to the Bush administration.\nBut it is within the State Department but not within USAID, but it utilizes many of the development and health experts in USAID both on the government payroll and on contracts to actually do the work.\nWe have the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which is a very creative and innovative approach to foreign aid, which is an independent entity, which again looks to USAID for advice and expertise.\nSo we've got to get our arms around what you could think of as traditional foreign aid -- health, education, economic empowerment and the like -- plus what is now becoming increasingly important -- that's the reconstruction, stability, conflict resolution, peacekeeping challenge that we face.\nAnd, Senator, I am determined that we're going to present to you a plan and a system that will try to maximize coordination, minimize redundancy and make the case for the increased resources that are so desperately needed if we intend to meet the missions that we've been given.\nAnd that is why I think Jack Lew, who will fill the deputy position on budget and resources, is the point of accountability, because so much of what we're going to have to straighten out and fix are resource decisions.\nAnd we've got to make the case -- I think Secretary Gates is open to the case. I know the president-elect is very committed. He wants a -- actually an increase in foreign aid because he believes so strongly in its efficacy as part of our foreign policy.\nThey're committed to transferring assets and functions back to the State Department, but we have to prove that we're ready to take them on, that we're going to handle them, that we can instill confidence in you and Senator Cardin and others about these core functions and, you know, answer Senator DeMint's concerns about, you know, are we really doing what we need to do here.\nSo that is my pledge to you, and I'm going to work as hard as I know how to make it happen.\nMENENDEZ: We'd look forward to working with you on that.\nLet me just touch on specific areas, and then I hope not to give you any questions at the end of the day so you can move through the process -- written questions.\nBut in 100 days, the new administration will inherit the Summit of the Americas, and it will be either the president-elect's imprint or it will be that which existed before.\nWe have challenge in Latin America, and our challenges are lack of engagement in a way that makes a difference. We need to care less about what Chavez says and more about what we do at the end of the day.\nAnd so I hope that we can work with you and that the administration will focus very quickly on what that summit is going to look like. And I hope that we have an Americas Initiative soon -- obviously, not by the summit, but at least talking about the outlines of what that will be.\nThe hemisphere is incredibly important. It is in turmoil and challenge in many parts of it. And I hope that that is something that we will look at very quickly.\nMENENDEZ: I know you have supported the legislation we had that came to the committee in a bipartisan, unanimous on creating a social and economic development fund for the Americas. We'll call it to your attention.\nTwo last areas of the world. There are many, but I hope that the support that you gave while you were a senator to the question of the Armenian genocide that the president-elect has, himself, supported, the recognition of that. You know, if we are to say never again, part of that is ultimately the recognition of what has happened so that we can move forward.\nAnd I hope that you will be an advocate of having us get off of where we have been and move forward to a recognition of that part of history that is universally recognized so that we can move forward in that respect.\nAnd I also hope, in a part of the world that's very important to me, on the question of the reunification of Cypress, that we have honest brokers at the State Department at the end of the day. One that recognizes that if Greek and Turkish Cypriotes could work for each other, they would seek a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation that could move forward and reunify the island and end up the incredible militarization of the island -- the most militarized part of the world per capita.\nSo I hope that you will look at those issues. I know the positions you've taken as a senator, and I applaud them. I hope that they won't change drastically as you move to the secretary of state.\nCLINTON: Senator, we will be looking very closely at those and other challenging issues with the eye of moving forward and being effective in responding to these very legitimate concerns.\nMENENDEZ: I look forward to supporting your administration.\nKERRY: Thank you, Senator Menendez.\nThank you, Senator Clinton for a good morning of testimony. You've displayed one of the assets necessary for the job. You sat there for three hours and 15 minutes. And we look forward to the afternoon session.\nAnd I should say that to everybody here. It's been a remarkably attentive and quiet audience. So we appreciate that very much.\nKERRY: So we will recess until no sooner than 2 o'clock, and we'll try it make it as absolutely close to 2 as possible. We stand in recess. Thank you.\n(RECESS)\nKERRY: The hearing will come back into order, and I apologize to everybody, particularly to our colleagues who were here on time.\nSenator Isakson, I'm sorry about that.\nWe had the president-elect meeting with us at our caucus on the minor topic of the monster of TARP and also the stimulus. So I'm sure you can all understand it was spirited and important and that's why we are late. And I apologize for that.\nI said that we would pick up -- we're going to complete the first round of ten-minute questions. And I think for the second round, we'll probably going with seven minutes and see how we proceed.\nBut, Senator Isakson, you're up next, and we appreciate your patience.\nISAKSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd, Chelsea -- Chelsea, you should know that your mother and I had a conversation in my office. She's very proud of you and very proud of the support you give to her. And I got to show her all my grandchildren, so she'll have plans for you in the future, I can guarantee you.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSenator Clinton, it's a pleasure. I want to commend you -- this is not really a question; just a statement. But I have the highest regard for Senator Lugar. I think the remarks -- the pre-hearing questions he sent to you with regard to the Clinton Foundation were very important, and I think his insights are very important because, in your answers to those questions, on a couple of occasions, you made the statement the goal was to protect against even the appearance of a conflict of interest between his work, meaning the foundation's, and the duties of secretary of state.\nAnd we all know that in this world of politics, perception becomes reality. So appearance is everything. And I commend Senator Lugar's recommendations to you. Also, twice in your opening remarks which were extensive and, really, appreciated because you really covered some very important topics, you referred to what I call the three D's -- diplomacy, development, and defense -- on two different occasions. Once, vis-a- vis Al Qaida and then other just based on overall policy.\nI believe that the better your diplomacy, the better your ability to defend yourself. And a strong military is a great foundation for good diplomacy. And then if you add the development -- which I think is soft power or smart power -- you have a great trilogy. Do you agree with that?\nCLINTON: Senator Isakson, I couldn't say it any better. I certainly do agree.\nIn order to protect and defend the United States of America, to advance our interests, and to further our values, we have to have all three of those elements of our power working in concert. But, clearly, as I said, as you pointed out in my opening statement, a strong military is essential for the ultimate protection of our country and our interests.\nIt is my hope that through more vigorous and effective diplomacy we would be able to resolve both problems that we have with individual countries and the transnational problems like proliferation that threaten out of us.\nAnd so I think that the State Department has a very big responsibility to improve its capacity with respect to both diplomacy and development because, without those two elements of our power projection and our policy being as effective as they can be, we're not going to have the agile, comprehensive foreign policy we should look forward to.\nISAKSON: In the presidential debate, I watched both sides -- ours and yours. There was a significant debate over foreign policy and over the issue of precondition. I was -- really appreciated your responses throughout, and I think you added a great deal of strength to that debate.\nAnd now that we're looking at suggestions of talking to Hamas or maybe Hezbollah or maybe Iran, preconditions are absolutely essential, I think, to good, strong diplomacy. I hope you still feel that way.\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly do, as does the president-elect. I think that his commitment to vigorous and effective diplomacy is in context of his understanding that there are different ways for us to engage.\nWhen it comes to non-state actors like Hamas, as I said at the very end of the morning session, there are conditions. Hamas must renounce violence. They must recognize Israel, and they must agree to abide by all previous agreements.\nThere are conditions that are usually part of the preliminary discussion that would lead to any kind of negotiation. The president- elect believes that he has the right to claim the opportunity to speak with anybody at any time if it's in furtherance of our country's national interests and security. But he fully appreciates the preliminary work that has to be done in order to tee up any such discussions.\nSo I think we're in vigorous agreement, Senator, that we want to be smart about how we engage in diplomacy. We want to make sure that when the president of the United States or the secretary of state is engaged in any diplomatic effort that all of the necessary preliminary work, including conditions, if appropriate, have been met before doing so.\nISAKSON: You quoted George Marshal at the end of your remarks in saying that sometimes our enemies are not the nations or doctrines but they are, in fact, hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. I'm ranking member on the Africa Subcommittee. And if you talk about desperation, chaos, hunger, and poverty, certainly, you can talk about the continent of Africa and, in particular, North Africa and the Horn of Africa where Al Qaida is attempting to do what it did in Afghanistan, effectively, a decade and a half ago.\nAnd you talked about smart power. I think AFRICOM was a smart move on behalf of our country. And although a lot of people don't realize what AFRICOM is doing, they are military personnel doing a lot of soft power. They're drilling wells. They're building bridges. They're doing the things -- I hate to say this -- but Hamas and Hezbollah figured it out. They got political strength by giving people housing and clothing.\nA lot of times that use of soft power can win over people's attitudes towards you. So I hope, as the couple of years go by, or the next four years go by, we can work together on the continent of Africa and on those issues because I think it's the next place we are vulnerable if we aren't proactive in dealing with the governments, the people, the poverty, and, obviously, also, continuing the Bush PEPFAR program which has been so successful -- that and the malaria eradication.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, I appreciate it when I spoke with you, your commitment to Africa and your making it a priority of the service you've performed here on the committee. And I look forward to working with you.\nIt is a serious concern that we could see safe havens created again. The chaos that flows from failed states like Somalia, at this moment, the aftermath of autocratic regimes that have so mistreated their people, like Zimbabwe; the anarchy and terrible violence in Eastern Congo. I mean, those are breeding grounds not only for the worst abuses of human beings, from mass murders to rapes to indifference toward disease and other terrible calamities, but they are invitations to terrorists to find refuge amidst the chaos.\nAnd anyone who thinks that our interest in Africa is only humanitarian, I think, misses the strategic import of the comments you made. And I do look forward to working with you. ISAKSON: My last question. If you ask the average Georgia what's the one thing they have the most consternation about, it's how much money we spend in foreign aid. And although as a percentage of the budget, it's a small number, a lot of the stories that get published raise questions about it.\nTalking about preconditions for a second, I am one that feels like foreign aid invested, especially with preconditions for results is beneficial to the United States of America. And I shared with you the issue on women's education in Muslim countries Africa who, prior to 2001, we weren't really aware that we had money going to NGOs than going to education. It was only teaching Muslim men, not Muslim women.\nAnd we put a precondition post-9/11 and built schools for women in Egypt and Ethiopia and other places. And the payback has been a renaissance in those countries, at least, in raising the educational level of all.\nI'd appreciate your comments on the extent to which preconditions can be used in foreign aid -- not preconditions to agree with us but preconditions to see that the result brings about a benefit like, in this case, the education of women.\nCLINTON: Well, I think that has been an important contribution to the foreign aid debate by this administration, you know, most manifest with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. I think we're still finding our way trying it figure out the best practices to use to encourage governments to act in certain ways, conditioning our aid.\nBut I really believe this holds tremendous promise. And, again, it's an area that I would like to work with this committee on because there's a lot of expertise here. When you look at foreign aid, we want to be able to justify the investment to the American people and we want to get measurable results.\nCLINTON: Those are two goals that really go hand in hand. And so I believe strongly that as we try to shore up foreign aid, as we try to make the case for more development assistance, as we try to, you know, get back some of the authority and the resources that have drifted to the Defense Department, that we have to be ready to make that case.\nAnd I think the, you know, conditional aid approach in certain countries and situations is one we have to look at more closely.\nISAKSON: Well, I appreciate your willingness to serve, and I wish you the best of luck in your tenure. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Isakson.\nSenator Casey?\nCASEY: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. And I want to commend you on the new leadership position that you take, and we're grateful for your service.\nSenator Clinton, thank you very much for putting yourself forward to do a difficult job at a difficult time in our nation's history and for the time you're spending today. You're getting close to the end here.\nWhen you get down to this end to the table, it's -- we're kind of rounding the corner. And I want to stay within my time limits, because my friend here needs his time -- Jim Webb.\nI wanted to read you a statement that you're -- I think you're familiar with, but I think it -- it bears some emphasis today in light of what you said in your statement, in light of a lot of our concerns about the way foreign policy has been conduct, especially over the last eight years.\nThe person who made this statement first made reference to our institutions of diplomacy and development being undermanned and underfunded.\nAnd then I'll pick up with a quotation, and it starts this way, \"When it comes to America's engagement with the rest of the world, it's important that the military is in a supporting role\" -- supporting role -- \"to civilian agencies. Our diplomatic leaders must have the resources and political support needed to fully exercise their statutory responsibilities in leading American foreign policy. To truly harness the full strength of America requires having civilian institutions of diplomacy and development that are adequately staffed and properly funded,\" unquote.\nThe person who made that statement was Secretary Gates this past July. And I wanted, in light of the discussion here today -- and I'm grateful for the -- the time you spent in your statement on this -- but also in light of what you and I have talked about in our meeting and in other conversations -- tell us how you're going to be working with Secretary Gates to make sure that we can give meaning and integrity to that -- to that observation that he made in that speech in July.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, it's a tremendous honor for me to be working with Secretary Gates. He has a very long history of service in our country and has worked with I don't know how many presidents -- six, maybe seven.\nBut he has a broad, comprehensive view about what works for America and what doesn't. And he was in the, you know, real vanguard in the CIA and the National Security Council at the height of the Cold War.\nSo his experience is especially valuable, and I know the president-elect believes that and, as you know, asked him to stay on. I've had several conversations with him already, and what you read is exactly what he believes, that we are going to be stronger if we are better able to promote diplomacy and development, not just rely on our military power.\nThere's a lot of work to be done between that belief, which he and I and the president-elect share, and actually realizing its promise. We have work to do at the State Department.\nYou know, part of the reason functions and resources have migrated is because there's just a presumption that the -- you know, the military can move much quicker and with greater effort, impose development or negotiate agreements -- whatever it might be -- than the State Department.\nAnd it's going to be our job to prove that, you know, the -- the State Department is not only substantively strong -- which, indeed, it is -- not only experienced in diplomacy and development -- which, indeed, it is -- but can, in this 21st century, move with dispatch, be results-oriented, create an atmosphere of collegiality and cooperation across the State Department and USAID and across the United States government.\nSo I am taking this very seriously. I'm working with Secretary Gates. He's very open to cooperative efforts. But we have to prove that we can shoulder this responsibility, like stabilization and reconstruction and the new civilian corps, like, you know, really, outcomes-oriented development aid that can be done quickly without enormous bureaucracy. So we're going to take that challenge on, because I don't think we have a choice. I think that our foreign policy has gotten way out of balance. Secretary Gates knows it. The president-elect certainly knows it.\nSo it's going to be up to us to try to get back into more equilibrium, which will be good for our government and for the image of our country around the world.\nCASEY: Well, we want to support you in that -- in that objective, in meeting that objective.\nAnd I do want to commend you -- we had a discussion the other day about the -- the mechanics of running such a -- a massive agency, and I know we don't have a lot of time today, but I wanted to commend you on appointing Jack Lew as deputy secretary for management.\nI think it's important that when someone is assuming the responsibilities you are that you -- you've spent the kind of time you have to -- to put together a team that can help you run the department.\nI wanted to move to two -- one or two more issues before my time expires. One is on an issue that I've worked with Senator Lugar on, the ranking member, as well as other members of this committee have worked for years -- Senator Biden worked hard on this as well as others.\nAnd that's the challenge posed by nuclear terrorism. As great as the challenge and the threat is, we know from our history and from our -- from our research that it's a preventable catastrophe, if we take the right steps not just here but around the world.\nAnd I just want to get your thoughts on the steps we need to take, which will involve a number of departments of our federal government, but the State Department under your leadership will play a significant role in working with other countries to identify fissile material and to prevent its -- prevent it from getting in the hands of the wrong people.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, I know you expressed to me your -- your deep concern about this and your desire to get very involved in helping us craft an effective approach to protecting our country and our allies and, indeed, humanity from weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists.\nThe recent commission on WMD chaired by former Senators Graham and Talent was very sobering. Basically, they concluded that the evidence points to our seeing a terrorist attack using nuclear or biological materials some time in the next four years.\nYou add to that the growing threat of cyber terrorism, which has the potential of disrupting the networks we rely on for all kinds of things, like traffic signals and electric grids and the like, which would be incredibly disruptive and dangerous -- I mean, this is the number one threat we face, there's no doubt in my mind. So we're going to start calling it such. We're going to reorganize the department to be better prepared to deal with nonproliferation, arms control and these new threats.\nI look forward to working closely with this committee to get the best people we can into the State Department, to work with our partners across the United States government, and to send out a message loudly and clearly that the United States wants to be a leader once again, to control arms, particularly with Russia, and that's what the START talks will be aimed at doing, and to be much more aggressive in going after nonproliferation.\nSo this is our -- our very highest priority, because the consequences are so devastating.\nCASEY: And I know it -- one more question. We -- in -- in the time I have. We spoke a little bit the other day about the challenge that Pakistan presents to -- to all of us, to the American people but also to the world, for a lot of reasons, we know, not only because of the -- the threat in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the concern about the rivalry -- and that's an understatement -- with -- with India, and the question of whether this government will really take a -- make it a priority to root out the -- the extremist elements that are throughout different parts of Pakistan and the region.\nAnd finally, the nuclear -- the concern about the stability of their nuclear command and control -- coming into the office -- and I realize you're just starting, but what's -- how do you think we need to approach it from the State Department's point of view and in meeting those -- or being focused on those various concerns that I just outlined?\nCLINTON: Well, as I stated in my opening remarks, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East remain in the forefront of the challenges that the new administration will face.\nPakistan has a particular complexity because of its nuclear weapons capacity. But the democratically elected government has been saying a lot of the right things with respect to the threat posed by the extremists and terrorists, particularly along the border and in the FATA region in Pakistan.\nSo I'm -- I'm hopeful that we will have a very active, positive relationship with the new Pakistan government. I know that there's a lot of work being done even by the outgoing administration to deepen ties between our country and various institutions in Pakistan.\nBut this is a tough problem, Senator. I mean, this is a very complicated problem. It has many dimensions to it -- as you pointed out, the relationship with India, the relationship with Afghanistan, the role that Iran and others are playing in that region.\nWe have to approach this with the same level of attention and comprehensive understanding that our military is attempting to do as it ramps up our troop commitments in Afghanistan and works more closely with the government of Pakistan to protect them from violent extremists as well as to root out Al Qaida and other remnants of the terrorist networks so that they don't find safe haven in Pakistan to plan attacks against us or any other country.\nCASEY: Thank you very much.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Casey.\nSenator Vitter?\nVITTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations on your new chairmanship.\nKERRY: Thank you very much.\nVITTER: And thank you, Senator Clinton, for all of your public service, including being open to this very challenging position.\nLike a lot of folks, I have some concerns about these conflict issues, particularly with regard to the Clinton Foundation, and so I wanted to spend my first round exploring those concerns.\nLet me say a couple things -- first, that I think a lot of folks legitimately share these concerns across the spectrum, from the -- from the New York Times to Senator Lugar, who submitted some questions about it to me. That -- that perhaps defines the entire political spectrum. I'm not sure.\nAnd also, they arise because of very extraordinary circumstances, your husband being a former president, his very unique work in terms of the foundation, and -- and in terms of that work -- I applaud that, but they nevertheless arise because of that, and I think it really requires an extraordinary response.\nObviously, you all have put forward this memorandum of understanding to suggest that such a response -- and so I wanted to go into that and some of the details about it and some of my concerns.\nAnd -- and these posters just sort of briefly outline the situation before the MOU with the foundation, and those -- all those abbreviations are the ones used in the MOU, and then the situation after.\nOne thing that sort of leaped out at me is with regard to the Clinton Global Initiative, which in many ways is the most public and perhaps significant of these initiatives. Under the MOU, there's no disclosure of contributions, contributors, going forward.\nAnd that seems to be a big -- a big omission, because, again, that's one of the most significant activities here, probably the most widely followed and recognized in terms of the annual conference, et cetera.\nWould you support and help produce an amended MOU that would bring the same disclosure to future contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative? VITTER: Well, Senator, I -- I appreciate your concern, and your question, and -- and I recognize that these are unique circumstances, to say the least.\nCLINTON: I am very proud to be the president-elect's nominee for secretary of state, and I am very proud of what my husband and the Clinton Foundation and the associated efforts he's undertaken have accomplished, as well.\nIt is not unique, however, for spouses of government officials to work and there are very well established rules for what is expected when that occurs.\nIn this particular case, the Office of Government Ethics and the career ethics officials at the State Department have looked at the rules and concluded there is not an inherent conflict of interest in any of my husband's work at all.\nHowever, the foundation and the president-elect decided to go beyond what the law and the ethics rules call for to address even the appearance of conflict and that is why they signed a memorandum of understanding, which outlines the voluntary steps that the foundation is taking to address potential concerns that might come up down the road.\nThe memorandum of understanding is, as you know, public and the president-elect and the foundation and I have all worked to be very transparent.\nMy team has stayed in close touch with the committee and we've addressed the committee's questions on these issues in a broad range of written answers which are part of the so-called QFRs, the questions for the record.\nBut I want to speak for a minute, if I can, about the work that is done, because I think it's important...\nVITTER: Mr. Chairman, I have no objection listening to this, but I'd like it not to come out of my time, because I'd like to pursue these questions.\nKERRY: Well, I guess it's fair to say that if you ask a question, you deserve an answer and the answer traditionally comes out of the time of the Senator.\nVITTER: Well, I'm still waiting for the answer. I'd love an answer. But if there is an answer to my question...\nKERRY: Well, I think you need to give the Senator an opportunity to give you the answer and if you need additional time... VITTER: Let me repeat the question, which was would you support and help produce a new MOU that requires the same sort of disclosure for contributions for the Clinton Global Initiative.\nUnder this, there is no disclosure moving forward for contributions of the Clinton Global Initiative. So it's a yes or no. Would you support expanding that disclosure?\nAdmittedly, this is voluntary. It's not required by law. But it seems to be a big exception to the rule of the MOU in terms of disclosure.\nCLINTON: Well, I think that the MOU and the other undertakings that have been worked out between the president-elect and the transition and the foundation and my husband have looked very broadly at all of the questions that you're raising, and there are answers to many of these questions in the collection of answers that we have provided.\nAnd I will be happy to provide additional material and answers to you in response to that question.\nVITTER: OK. Well, if you could consider that suggestion, I think that's a big gap in the MOU that moving forward, the Clinton Global Initiative is separated from the foundation and then there's no disclosure whatsoever about contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative.\nThe other big gap, it seems to me, is that the disclosure in the MOU is for new contributors. And so old contributors who re-give or who even substantially increase their contributions, if it's to certain initiatives, aren't disclosed.\nWould you consider amending that so that all contributions, whether from new contributors or old contributors, would be disclosed?\nCLINTON: All contributors will be disclosed and all contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative are disclosed and public as of now anyway.\nVITTER: OK, but that changes under the MOU.\nCLINTON: No.\nKERRY: If I could just interrupt, Senator. I think if you look at the MOU and you look at the subsequent questions that were answered by the Senator to the committee, because we followed up on this issue, I believe that all -- we asked the question, \"Will all future contributions to the foundation be disclosed,\" and...\nVITTER: To the foundation?\nKERRY: That's the foundation, but in addition, it's my understanding that under the MOU, the CGI additionally, if there are contributions, they would be disclosed at the end of the year.\nCLINTON: That's right.\nVITTER: OK. I'm very happy to hear that. That's not what's in the MOU. So if I could simply request, before our vote, a document or an amendment from the transition and the foundation that clarify that, because under the MOU, moving forward, the Clinton Global Initiative is separated from the foundation and then there's disclosure under the foundation.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, I believe that all the answers that are relevant to these inquiries are in the record. There is no intention to amend the MOU. It has been worked out between the transition and the foundation.\nBut the Clinton Global Initiative is a pass-through. The money of any donors to put on the Clinton Global Initiative are public and there is no ongoing -- you know, the foundation is a yearly event. It's unlike the foundation.\nSo we will clarify it. We will definitely clarify that for you.\nVITTER: Well, it would be great if you can clarify it. Again, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but under the MOU, as it stands, there is no required disclosure going forward for Clinton Global Initiative contributions and there is no necessary required disclosure for new contributions of old contributors, just new contributors.\nThere's also been the suggestion from a lot of folks to disclose the date and amount or at least amount within ranges of new contributions and to do that at least quarterly rather than annually.\nWould you be open to that?\nCLINTON: Well, again, this is an agreement that has been worked out between all of the parties and the fact is that the concerns that were raised in the discussions between the foundation and the president-elect's team were thoroughly discussed and they believe, and I agree, that the transparency and disclosure that is needed, which, as you said yourself, it goes beyond any kind of legal or ethical consideration.\nAnd not only that, there will be ongoing -- there will be ongoing reviews by anything that is brought to the attention of the career professionals.\nBut I just have to go back, Senator, and try to set the record straight. CGI is not in the memorandum of understanding because they already have a practice of disclosing all of their contributions. There is no need to require it.\nI will certainly state here that they're going to continue the practice which they've already done.\nNo president has ever disclosed the contributions to his foundation. So when my husband agreed to disclose the contributions to his foundation, that was a very unprecedented event, which he was happy to do. But the Clinton Global Initiative, which is separate from the foundation, has always disclosed the contributions.\nVITTER: Well, again, I'd love for that to be embodied in any agreement that's at issue. So I'll look forward to that.\nKERRY: Well, Senator, can I just -- this won't come out of your time, but let me make sure the record is clear here.\nAs I understand it, I think Senator Lugar has raised a couple points and we're going to address them perhaps a little bit later, but I don't think this one, frankly, is on target, for the following reason.\nOn page four, paragraph two, it specifically says that CGI, President Clinton personally will not solicit funds. President Clinton will continue to send invitation letters to potential entity. However, he will no longer send sponsorship letters which seek contributions. Apart from attendance fees, CGI will not accept contributions from foreign governments.\nSo there is no solicitation and no acceptance of a foreign government.\nVITTER: But, for instance, there could be foreign national contributions, which, within the four corners of this agreement, are not disclosed, not necessarily disclosed.\nI mean, my question is, in that same paragraph, why isn't there a disclosure requirement.\nKERRY: Well, I think the Senator has appropriately said that they will answer that in the addendum.\nVITTER: I'd look forward to that, as well as the old contributor issue, because it just talks about new contributors.\nAgain, let me back up and underscore the central concern, which is I really do think this poses a lot of real and perceived conflict issues and you just need to look at some of the contributors from the past, particularly from the Middle East, to get a sense of what I'm talking about.\nFor instance, a lobby foundation supports Iranian causes. Just this past December 19, they made a substantial contribution to the foundation and that same day, the president of the foundation was indicted for obstruction of justice related to terrorist financing. And two days earlier, Treasury had named a partner of the foundation as a, quote, \"terrorist entity.\"\nAnother partner of the foundation, Bank Melli, has long been thought to be a procurement front for the Iranian nuclear program.\nThat's the sort of big issue, conflict issue that I think this poses, which could obviously complicate your job and be an impediment to your effectiveness. Another similar example, Issam Fares, former deputy prime minister of Lebanon, he's a big supporter of Hezbollah, says it's not in any way a terrorist organization, doesn't target the U.S.\nI'm sure the widows and family members of the victims of the 1983 Beirut bombing that killed 241 Americans were comforted by that. Obviously, they are terrorists, they do target the U.S. This poses serious issues.\nSo I look forward to following-up and getting that clarification and, also, I think it would round out this agreement immeasurably to include the date and amount of contributions, to pledges made, not simply have disclosures when a payment is made, and to at least do quarterly reports versus annual reports.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Vitter.\nSenator Webb?\nWEBB: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Clinton, I've had the pleasure of having sat through this entire hearing today -- I'm not sure you have found it very pleasurable -- partly because I'm really interested in these issues and partly because I'm so far down the food chain that I had to wait until 3 o'clock this afternoon to ask my questions.\nIt's nice to have Senator Shahim (ph) on my left, finally have somebody I'm a little -- and I'm very impressed by the range that you have shown here on a wide variety of issues that have been thrown at you.\nI've had the pleasure of working with you and discussing these issues over the past years, but I think you've done a marvelous job today.\nI guess the phrase of the week is \"smart power.\" I've been doing this a long time, in and out of government. People come up with different phrases.\nI think the most important thing that you have said is in your statement, your opening statement, when you mentioned that the goal of this administration is going to be more partners and fewer adversaries and to do so in a realistic way that still protects the interests of the United States, and I think that will be a major demarcation for our government as we relate to the rest of the world.\nYou and I have had many conversations over the years. This is a time that the context of these conversations are going to be shaped into what I believe will be achievable policies.\nI would like to list, very quickly, for the record, six or seven areas where I believe that these conversations will need to continue and, in some cases, there will probably be debates, but I think that it's important to outline these.\nThe first is the nature of the residual force in Iraq or even whether there should be a residual force in Iraq and how that situation would assist us in increasing stability in the region.\nYou mentioned the SOFA and the strategic framework agreement as national policy. As you know, I had a great deal of heartburn over the way that those agreements were signed here.\nThey were approved by the Iraqi parliament. We in the Congress did not even have an opportunity to vote on whether this was the way to proceed forward. I don't anticipate that situation coming up again.\nThe second is the need for a clearly articulated strategy with respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan. And we don't have a strategy unless we can articulate the endpoint and I look forward to working with you toward not only being able to define that, but being able to define some sort of an achievable endpoint to our presence in Afghanistan.\nThe third is a reexamination of the way that we have proceeded with NATO expansion. I did a lot of work in NATO when I was assistant secretary of defense and, quite frankly, this isn't the NATO that I was working with and I'm very concerned about the transition from essentially alliances into a number of protectorates in these newer countries and that's a situation that makes our country, I believe, very vulnerable.\nThe fourth is a need for us to adjust our strategic relationship with China. There have been a lot of...\n(AUDIO GAP)\nFEINGOLD: ... the State Department policy that make it difficult for the partners and foreign service officers to travel and live at an overseas post. What would you do as secretary of state to address these concerns? Will you support changes to existing personnel policy in order to ensure that LGBT staff at State and USAID receive equal benefits and support?\nCLINTON: Senator, this issue was brought to my attention during the transition. I've asked to have more briefing on it because I think that we should take a hard look at the existing policy. As I understand it, but don't hold me to it because I don't have the full briefing material, but my understanding is other nations have moved to extend that partnership benefit. And we will come back to you to inform you of decisions we make going forward.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you very much. Thanks, Senator.\nWell, we're sort of getting to that point now where I think we can address some loose ends and maybe even, you know, sort of have some fun and dig into things a little bit here in ways that we can't otherwise. But we promise not to prolong it. And we'll try and remain focused on those things that are really salient here.\nLet me begin with Afghanistan, if I may. I am deeply concerned that, at least thus far, our policy in Afghanistan has kind of been on automatic. And I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would not see all of our conflicts, ground operations in the context of Vietnam. I really try hard. I have an automatic check that says, you know, not everything is that.\nBut I have to tell you, in the several visits I have now made, escape it as I might, the parallels just really keep leaping out in so many different ways.\nWe are struggling to fight with and for people with a different culture, a different language, different custom, different history, different religion, if any. And all of those similarities exist. We don't live there. We don't live in the community, in a hamlet, in a small town, pocket, whatever you want to call it.\nAnd so we're not there often at night. They are. And the night often rules with insurgencies. The complications are profound in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. And I went to both -- and to India -- immediately after Mumbai and was really struck by the extraordinary distance we have to travel in both places, Senator.\nThat is the center of the war on -- I've got check myself. I hope this administration and all of us will begin to think differently in this terminology of war on terror and think in terms of the global counterinsurgency and the difference between counterinsurgency and counterterrorism and the challenges that we face in addressing both and understanding them both.\nOne person made a very interesting comment to me while I was over there and said, you know, Pakistan is a government without a country, and Afghanistan is a country without a government. And if you stop and think about -- so the real application -- and no insult meant to anybody. President Karzai is a friend. We've all met with him. We want his success.\nBut there are inherent contradictions in the structure that we have been trying to impose in Afghanistan. And more and more, as I travel that part of the world -- I served most recently as chair of the Subcommittee on Mideast, South Asia -- so I was frequently there.\nIt left -- it kept leaping out at me in ways that, over a number of years here, I really, frankly had not given enough consideration to. But recently read a wonderful book when I commend to you by Rory Stewart, you know, \"The Places in Between\" and another book, \"The Forever War\" and a whole host of them that really give you the flavor of this if you really want it -- I mean, \"Gertrude Bell, the Desert Queen\" is a fascinating study of sort of the region and of tribalism. And that's really what I want to point to.\nWe have not, I think -- we honored tribalism when we dealt with the Northern Alliance and initially went in to Afghanistan. We really haven't adequately since. And it strikes me that if we just put troops, plunk them down, another 20, 30,000 in Afghanistan, without very limited view of what they can achieve and need to do and a comprehensive view of other things we need to do to build the successful structures of governance -- the police, the judiciary which may be a pipe dream, the construction programs, the ability of Hamid Karzai's government, as well intentioned as he may be and as much as we like him, the ability to even get out of Kabul and be able to do anything in the countryside, I think -- Madam Secretary Designate, we're on the wrong track.\nAnd I think unless we rethink this very, very carefully, we could raise the stakes, invest America's reputation in a greater way as well as our treasure and wind up pursuing a policy that is, frankly, unpursuable, unachievable.\nSo I'd like to elicit your thoughts on this. I was in Pasharah (ph) a few weeks ago. I learned that -- and some in Pakistan would disagree with this, and I'll probably hear from some of my friend there. But many people believe that it would not be hard for the Taliban to move in there if that's the decision they decided to make.\nIt was so dangerous that we were not able to move into the downtown and other areas. And we just saw last week 600 Taliban cross the border from Afghanistan and came in and directly attacked a frontier corps military outpost.\nI have anybody who has really traveled on the ground, listened in the right ways, and not just accepted the sort of briefing culture will suggest to you respectfully, Madam Secretary, this really has to be rethought very, very carefully.\nOur original goal was to go in there and take on Al Qaeda. It was to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. It was not to adopt the 51st state of the United States. It was not to try to impose a form of government, no matter how much we believe in it and support it, but that is -- that is the mission, at least, as it is being defined today.\nSo I'd like to ask for your thoughts on this as you engage in what will, obviously, be a hasty and important critical review and some judgments that we need to make about our policy.\nCLINTON: Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that your cautions are extremely well taken. There is, as you know, a review going on right now under the direction of General Petraeus through CENTCOM. If I understand it, he has approximately 300 people, some of them detailees from the State Department, who are crisscrossing Afghanistan trying to determine, as I understand it, what is and isn't feasible.\nWe are in close communication with General Petraeus. We intend to, when it's appropriate on January 20th, to begin our own immediate review because I share your concern as I know the president-elect does. You know, his approach toward Afghanistan, which is has been more for more -- you know, more troops would go in but there would have to be more from NATO and there would have to be more from Afghanistan -- you know, presupposes that we have a set of discreet goals that we are trying to achieve.\nAnd that is in the process of being assessed and analyzed right now. As you're aware, President Bush had inside the White House General Lute, who was largely responsible for coordinating policy with respect to both Iraq and Afghanistan.\nSo the Bush administration has put a lot of assets to work on trying to determine what is the best way forward with Afghanistan and how do we affect the future of Pakistan, the decisions that they make. But I think that asking the hard questions and raising the red flags is exactly what this committee I know will do and should do.\nSitting here today, when I think about my trips to Afghanistan, my flying over that terrain, my awareness of the history going back to Alexander the Great and, certainly, the imperial British military and Rudyard Kipling's memorable poems about Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, which put in more troops than we're thinking about putting in -- I mean, it calls for a large doze of humility about what it is we are trying to accomplish.\nHaving said that, I think that we will keep you informed as we move forward. And on the civilian side, I hope that we will have the opportunity for more in-depth conversations. I mean, I've been on both sides now of the table here.\nAnd there is so much to discuss, and there is so much expertise on this committee -- people who have traveled widely, thought deeply, know a lot of the players. And I hope that, you know, if I am confirmed, that I'll be able to have you and others literally sitting down and talking with the people that we're going to be tasking to come up with the civilian side of this strategy so that we go in with our eye open, whatever it is we're trying to achieve.\nKERRY: Well, I really appreciate that. I don't expect you to be able to lay out that strategy now.\nI would say that I think it's important, perhaps, for the administration -- the incoming administration -- to not just have the review process that's been put in place be the only standard for a baseline. And I think we need to make certain that there's a subsequent expectation with regard to that. I think it would be a mistake to just do that.\nI think you probably agree with that.\nSecondly, with respect to the current military operations, I spent a lot of time in a couple of briefings that we're not allowed to discuss in public here. But trying to really get at this question of the targeting with respect to the Pakistan, the Fatah, and our efforts to take out terrorists in that area.\nThere has been a considerable blow-back and, I think, counterproductivity in the collateral damage that has been occurring there. And I hope that you would also agree to really dig into that and take a look at whether or not all of that, the targeting, is in fact as purported to be and as important as is suggested because I think we're creating some terrorists and losing some ground in the effort to win the hearts and minds as they say.\nCLINTON: Yes, sir.\nKERRY: On the situation with Pakistan, they not only face the challenge of the insurgency in the country; they have a dire economic crisis also. And in many ways, the economic crisis may be just as challenging.\nWe, after I went over with Senator Biden and Senator Hagel last year, we came back and propped a tripling of the aid to $1.5 billion a year over the course of a number of years. And I wonder, can you say today that the administration is -- remaining absolutely committed to that because we want to try to move that as rapidly as we can?\nCLINTON: Yes. The president-elect does support the regulation that you were part of and Vice President-elect Biden and, I think, Senator Lugar was as well.\nKERRY: Correct.\nCLINTON: And we want it try to begin, to some extent, to separate our military aid from our non-military aid. The tripling of the non-military aid is intended to provide resources that will both support the Pakistani people but also give some tools to the democratically-elected government to try to start producing results for the people of Pakistan.\nThe military aid, we want to, you know, really look hard at seeing whether we can condition some of that on the commitment for the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism missions. So we certainly are inclined to support, when appropriate, the legislation that you were referring to.\nKERRY: And this is going to take a very significant hands-on effort, as I think you know. We've been, obviously, reading about or hearing about the potential of special envoys, as series of them. Do you want to address that at all today?\nCLINTON: Well, no final decisions have been made. That is a tool that I think you will see more use of. I believe that special envoys, particularly, vis a vis military commands, have a lot to recommend in order to make sure that we've got the civilian presence well represented.\n(AUDIO GAP)\nCLINTON: ... because all of the independent professionals who do this for our government said there was no conflict. So it's a kind of a catch-as-catch-can problem. I mean, when it was all submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, they said there was no inherent conflict.\nMy husband doesn't take a salary. He has no financial interests in any of this. I don't take a salary. I have no financial interests. So out of that abundance of caution and a desire to avoid even the appearance, the president-elect's transition team began working with the foundation to try to craft an agreement that would avoid the appearance of a conflict but would also ensure that the foundation can continue its work.\nYou know, I'm very proud of the work that the foundation did. And when you look at why it received, for example, foreign government money, it's because early on there wasn't the support from our government until, frankly, the leadership of President Bush and members of this Congress created PEPFAR.\nAnd there was also a tremendous financial burden on poor states to try to afford the pharmaceuticals, the anti-retro-virals. So my husband's foundation worked with generic drug manufacturers to help improve their systems of manufacturing and get the cost down so that it would be affordable.\nSo the governments of countries like Canada, Norway, and Ireland and the UN said, well, this is the best deal ever. So this is all passed-through money. None of this goes to or stays in the foundation. This is used for the purchasing contracts in order to buy the drugs to keep, you know, many people alive and, particularly, about 1.4 million people including many children.\nSo the work of the foundation, the confidence that it has created with donors who know that it has an extremely low percentage that goes to any overhead. It has a very transparent way that it uses the money. We're very persuasive to the transition team that we had to work out something to keep the foundation in business while I did what I needed to do to be as transparent as possible.\nSo the kinds of concerns that were put forth were very carefully considered. And, you know, I do believe that the agreement provides the kind of transparency under the memorandum of understanding, foreign government pledges will be submitted to the State Department for review. I don't know who will be giving money. That will not influence, it was not be in the atmosphere. When the disclosure occurs, obviously, it was be after the fact. So it would be hard to make an argument that it influenced anybody because we don't know about it.\nSo I think that, in a way, the president-elect's transition team saw the agreement that has been worked out is actually in the best interests of avoiding the appearance of conflict. Now, I hasten to say that my career in public service is hardly free of conflict, Senator. So I have no illusions about the fact that no matter what we do there will be those who will raise conflicts.\nBut I can absolutely guarantee you that I will keep a very close look on how this is being implemented. I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised.\nBut I think that the way that this has been hammered out is probably as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it. And we've tried to do the very best we could. LUGAR: Well, my time is concluded. But let me just say that the situation is unprecedented when a first lady and her distinguished husband and a foundation come together with a State Department hearing of this sort.\nI am hopeful that, as we go through the history of this, that people will not say, well, Senator Lugar, Senator Kerry, and others were pressing it. They saw the problems. And we'll get full credit, but that will not be helpful to our foreign policy, to you, to your husband, to the foundation.\nThis is why I plea for you, really, to give even more consideration -- it may not be a decision made today because I appreciate the negotiations have been sizeable. And you are a good negotiator and so is your husband. So are those who have worked for you. I admire that. It's a good things for a State Department official and, particularly, the secretary of state.\nBut this seems to me to be so important at the outset. This is why I've dwelled upon it, trying your patience and that of the committee, because I think it is very important. And I think you understand that.\nCLINTON: I do. And I respect you so much, Senator. And I can, you know, certainly guarantee to you that I will remain very sensitive to this and I will work with you and the chairman as we go forward.\nLUGAR: Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Lugar.\nLet me take a moment to welcome Senator Shaheen. This is her first official formal appearance with the committee. We just ratified the assignments at lunch today. And so we're delighted to have you here. I'm personally delighted because you're a great friend and a good neighbor. And we're really happy to have you as a member of this committee.\nSHAHEEN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very honored to be able to serve on this prestigious committee with you and Senator Lugar. And as I'm sure you know, I have been a big fan of your public service to the country for a very long time as well as your broad knowledge and expertise in this area.\nAnd just as this country faces unprecedented economic challenges, we also face the most complicated foreign relations and national security challenges since the end of the Cold War. And I know that under your leadership and the leadership of Senator Lugar that this committee will address these vital issues in a bipartisan way. And I'm delighted to be able to serve with you as we do that.\nSenator Clinton, congratulations on your terrific nomination. Your testimony this morning, I thought, reinforced the fact that you have a breadth of knowledge and experience to be an outstanding secretary of state. And I commend President-elect Obama for choosing you.\nThe two of you working in a partnership will truly have the opportunity to change the world. And I have no doubt that you will do that.\nOn a personal note, I have to say that I am disappointed that I won't be able to serve with you in the Senate but look forward to working with you as a member of this committee.\nI have two questions since you have covered many of the issues that I would have asked. One is a broader question and the other is a little more parochial relative to New Hampshire.\nThe first has to do with the international economy. And I know that you and Senator Dodd discussed this a little bit earlier today. But over one-fifth of the manufacturing workers in my state of New Hampshire depend on exports for their jobs. I was interested to see recent reports that you would like to see the State Department take a more active role on questions of international economics.\nAnd I thought that would certainly be a change from the Bush administration, which has placed the international economic agenda primarily in the Department of Treasury. So a wondered if you could speak a little bit to the role that you see for the State Department in addressing these economic -- international economic issues.\nCLINTON: Well, Senator Shaheen, welcome to the Senate and welcome to this committee. I think your joining this body will be an incredible addition and I look forward to working with you in this new capacity.\nI, to, regret that we won't serve together as senators, but I'm glad you're on this committee so that we can continue our friendship.\nI think that's a really timely question. And it is one of the concerns that I have explored since being asked to take this position. How do we get our economic international agenda better integrated into the State Department? Obviously, Treasury has a huge role to play, but so does the State Department.\nAnd, you know, we're going to be responsible for the climate change negotiations. Well, you know, that has economic, environmental, and energy-related implications. The questions earlier from Senator Lugar about energy security -- huge economic implications.\nAnd then the meltdown of the international economic regulatory system means that our foreign policy is impacted in so many ways in so many parts of the world. So there is a lot that we have to pay attention to. And we have a National Security Council, but we also have a National Economic Council. And it will be part of the Obama administration's plans that the State Department will participate in both, not just one; that we will be very much involved in the crafting of international economic efforts.\nThe G-20, which will be coming up in April, hosted by Prime Minister Gordon Brown in London, we're going to be playing a role in helping to, you know, design the agenda for that. So on all of these issues, I think it is important to have a broader approach than just, you know, one agency because our economic standing effects everything we're doing.\nYou know, dealing with Russia on START -- you know, some of that will be influenced by the economic situation that we're confronting. Trying to deal with the modernization of the military in China -- we've got to have a strategic relationship, as Senator Webb said, but we also have to make sure that they continue buying our debt.\nI mean, we have a lot of very complicated international economic issues that directly impact our foreign policy. So we're going to be working on those. And I welcome any and all advice that you might have.\nSHAHEEN: Thank you. The second question is related somewhat, and it deals with trade. We have a company in New Hampshire -- and forgive me for being parochial -- called Goss International that makes large printing presses.\nThey had Japan come in and dump imports into the market. They went to court and sued under our trade laws and got a judgment in U.S. district court. And Japan retaliated by passing a recovery or a claw back that allowed the company that was doing the dumping to actually appropriate Goss' investments in Japan. And the State Department has really done very little to address this issue in a way that -- despite the court judgment on behalf of the American company.\nSo what role do you see the State Department playing as companies like Goss are dealing with this violation of U.S. trade laws?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know anything about that specific case. We will look into that and educate ourselves about it. But more generally, I think this has to be part of our broader trade discussions.\nThe president-elect is in favor of free and fair trade. He wants to figure out how trade becomes more of a win-win for our manufacturers, our businesses, you know, our citizens. And that's going to be part of what we look at. What are the rules that we want to enforce in our country? And what do we expect through reciprocal relations with other countries?\nSo I'm well familiar with the general nature of the problem because I faced much of this in New York over the last eight years. But we're going to try to be more creative and substantive in addressing what we can do to create a more favorable, positive atmosphere so that, if there are violations, they can immediately be taken care of within the global trading framework and you don't face retaliation and you don't have to worry about unfair competition.\nSHAHEEN: Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator.\nSenator Barrasso?\nBARRASSO: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd congratulations, Senator Clinton. We've worked together on the Superfund Committee you chaired and I was the ranking Republican. And I always found you to be very prepared, very thorough, very thoughtful. And I'm sure you're going bring all of those same things to the State Department.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much.\nBARRASSO: Senator Shaheen was apologizing for being parochial. I will be a little parochial because the people of Wyoming, as a travel around, want to make sure that our -- the foreign aid that we spend, especially in light of the U.S. economy today, is being used so that people are really getting value for their money and that we are safeguarding the U.S. taxpayer dollars.\nCould you talk a little bit about how to balance allocating foreign aid and making sure that American taxpayers are getting value for their money?\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, I appreciate very much your interest in these issues, and I have enjoyed my relationship with you since you arrived in the Senate. And I look forward to working with you.\nI want to be able to go to Wyoming or go to New York or Massachusetts or Indiana or New Hampshire or anywhere in America and explain why the relatively small but important amount of money we do spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the American people; that it promotes our national security and advances our interests and reflects our values.\nTo be able to do that, I have to make sure the State Department and I, in particular, tell the story about what we do and why. I mean, you and other members of this committee often travel and see the results of the work, but it's very difficult to convey that to the rest of our country. And I will look for better ways through public diplomacy in telling our story overseas and better ways here at home through my own efforts to explain what we do to our fellow Americans.\nBut I think it also has to be part of an overall review of how we conduct foreign aid, how we fund it, who's responsible for it, which is why I decided to have the second deputy, Jack Lew, that -- who'll be responsible for resources and management, because I want somebody to be able to come up and talk with you about very specific ideas we have about how to make foreign aid more effective.\nIt's pretty divided, and I think we have degraded the capacity of USAID over the last years to be our premiere aid development organization. And a lot of what's been drifting toward the Defense Department, as Senator Webb said, is -- is foreign aid in a traditional way. When a young Army captain gets cash to go build a school, that's foreign aid. That's not war fighting. That's something that we always thought of as development assistance.\nSo we've just got to do a better job of trying to explain and justify and rationalize and make efficient what we do, so that, you know, if I'm fortunate enough to come to Wyoming, and I can go to some town hall or forum with you, in a, you know, year or two, I'll be able to explain what we're doing, why we're doing it, and why it makes a difference to the people who are there.\nBARRASSO: Well, consider yourself invited.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nBARRASSO: And the second question they'll ask is -- when you come is about management reform at the United Nations and the money that American taxpayers are spending there, and you -- do you have...\nCLINTON: Yes.\nBARRASSO: ... some thoughts on that?\nCLINTON: Well, this is another priority of the president-elect, and I know you'll be speaking with the permanent representative to the U.N.-designee in a day or two.\nThe U.N. must reform. It -- it has to be more transparent, more efficient, and we are going to press for those kinds of changes.\nAt the same time, the United States has to be a good partner with the U.N. so that if we use the U.N., as we do, for peacekeeping or other actions that we believe are in the best interests of the United States as well as the United Nations, we're going to have to bear our burden.\nSo this is really a two-track commitment. We've got to work with our -- our partners at the United Nations as well as the permanent bureaucracy there to do everything we can to try to streamline the operations, modernize the system, make them more transparent, and then we have to be sure we do our part so we don't lose credibility as we push that reform agenda.\nBARRASSO: Moving on to Iran -- and I know you've addressed it -- reading your article in Foreign Affairs, you said if Iran is, in fact, willing to end its nuclear program, renounce sponsorship of terrorism, support Middle East peace and play a constructive role in stabilizing Iraq, the United States should be prepared to offer Iran a carefully calibrated package of incentives.\nDo you have a clear path in your mind of how to get from where we are today, where Iran appears to be continuing toward the development of nuclear weapons, continues to spew forth hatred of Israel, to get to a point where -- where these things would apply? And how do we do that from -- from here? CLINTON: Well, Senator, there is a policy review that is being undertaken by the incoming administration. We are still being briefed by the outgoing administration. We don't yet have a full picture of all of the information that the current administration has within its control.\nSo we will be working together across government lines, through the national security team, to devise a new approach.\nThe president-elect called for such a new approach just over the weekend in some interviews that he did, and we are very open to, you know, looking to find a positive, effective way of engaging Iran.\nHowever, as I said to the chairman, a nuclear-armed Iran is not acceptable to the United States. It is our job to persuade other countries that it should not be acceptable to them either, to consult with our friends and allies in the Gulf who have as much or more at stake than anyone, and certainly with Israel, that views a nuclear- armed Iran as a grave threat, so that as we move forward with any new approach or effort at engagement we are bringing our friends and allies along with us, we're not surprising anybody, because Iran, with its litany of terrorist sponsorship and interference with other countries' internal affairs, and certainly the role that it's played destructively, from our view, in Iraq and so much else, as you know, is a concern not just for the United States and Israel.\nIt's a deep concern to many other nations. And so we want a broad as base (sic) as possible as we try to devise a way forward.\nBARRASSO: Thank you.\nCould I shift a little bit to Cuba? As you know, right now we have strict laws and regulations limiting economic transactions with -- with Cuba, with relatives of folks who are here. Any thought on lifting restrictions on families to visit and send -- and send things to Cuba?\nCLINTON: Senator, the president-elect is committed to lifting the family travel restrictions and the remittance restrictions. He believes, and I think it's a very wise insight, that Cuban-Americans are the best ambassadors for democracy, freedom and a free market economy.\nAnd as they are able to travel back to see their families, that further makes the case as to the failures of the Castro regime -- the repression, the political denial of freedom, the political prisoners -- all of the very unfortunate actions that have been taken to hold the Cuban people back.\nYou know, our policy is, first and foremost, about the freedom of the Cuban people and the bringing of democracy to the island of Cuba. We hope that the regime in Cuba, both Fidel and Raul Castro, will see this new administration as an opportunity to change some of their typical approaches.\nLet those political prisoners out. Be willing to, you know, open up the economy and lift some of the oppressive strictures on the people of Cuba. And I think they would see that there would be an opportunity that could be perhaps exploited.\nBut that's in the future, whether or not they decide to make those changes.\nBARRASSO: OK.\nI appreciated some of the comments you made earlier about the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and working with that, and I know you're working Senator Lugar there and others on the committee.\nYou spoke strongly about verification and ongoing monitoring provisions to make sure that that continues. I wonder in these treaties about differentials in terms of what the United States gives up and others give up for us to agree to get signatures on that.\nCould you talk a little bit about that and what standards we will hold other countries and how we make sure that their understanding is the same as our understanding?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that's a very good point. You know, the history of arms control with first the Soviet Union and then Russia -- I think it's fair to say -- and of course, Senator Lugar is an expert on this -- has been a history of success, by and large.\nEven in the midst of the Cold War, there were negotiations that led to arms control agreements. And certainly, it is our hope that the United States can once again be a leader on reducing the number of warheads and the -- the threat of nuclear war, making sure that we have no remnants of Cold War command and control issues and the like.\nWe are very serious about negotiating and are willing to go lower so long as the Russians are as well, and that the deterrent that we have we always believe is adequate.\nWe won't really know, Senator, until we get into these negotiations, but they're going to be on a fast track, because the START agreement, as you know, expires at the end of this year, so we've got to get serious and get involved, and we will have a negotiator named so that we can start almost immediately.\nBARRASSO: Thank you, Senator Clinton.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. My time's expired.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator.\nI'll take a round now, and then -- I see Senator Feingold is here. I don't know if there are any other folks who are going to look for a second round. If there aren't, then maybe I'll let Senator Feingold go, and then we'll just stay focused and wrap up on sort of a series of questions.\nSenator Feingold?\nFEINGOLD: Well, thanks much, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you for your patience, Senator Clinton. Just a couple other topics. You and I discussed Somalia, and I've been long concerned about the deepening crisis there, particularly its implications for our national security.\nJust this last month, several senior officials, including CIA Director Hayden and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen, said that Al Qaida is extending its reach in Somalia and engaging extremists there to revitalize its operations.\nAs I told you, I met with many leading figures in Somalia during a recent December trip to Djibouti. Those meetings reinforced my belief that while Somalis are a moderate people, the situation is now far worse than it was two years ago, and the current administration's approach to Somalia is at least partly to blame.\nWhat's your view on -- on what's gone wrong with that and how -- how we can fix it? Give me a little sense of what you think some of the key components are, understanding you haven't had a chance to get into all of this at this point.\nCLINTON: Senator, as you and I discussed, Somalia is strategically located. I think it was you who asked me if I knew how far Yemen was from Somalia. If it wasn't you, it was some smart person who asked me that.\nFEINGOLD: I didn't know. I had to ask my staff and -- quite surprised to learn it was 20 miles.\nCLINTON: Twenty miles. And so the idea that Somalia is just a failed state somewhere over there where people are fighting with one another over heaven knows what is a -- a construct that we adopt at our peril.\nI -- I don't know the most effective way forward. I have no -- you know, no wisdom on this, Senator. I know you met in Djibouti over a period of a couple of days with a number of the -- the actors.\nAs you know, the Ethiopian troops are leaving. The African Union commitment is questionable as to whether they will or will not stay and what their mission description would be.\nThe internal conflict within the groups in Somalia is just as intense as it's ever been, only now we have the added ingredient of Al Qaida and terrorists who are looking to take advantage of the chaos and the failure of Somalia.\nThere's a lot of history here, and I think we have to be very thoughtful as we look at Somalia. This is obviously a -- an issue that will have to be worked across the national security apparatus.\nAnd I would welcome your advice. You probably have as much firsthand knowledge of the players and what they intend and who they are and -- and what they're really looking for as anyone, you know, in this body. And so we're going to -- we're going to seek your advice and counsel.\nI mean, as the chairman well remembers, at the beginning of the last Democratic administration, there was a humanitarian mission in Somalia that was handed off.\nAnd the beginning of this Democratic administration, here we are once again with the remnants of a humanitarian mission, and certainly, the humanitarian crisis growing that is going to put this problem in the lap of the new president.\nFEINGOLD: Exactly.\nCLINTON: So I -- I think that this is going to require an enormous amount of thought.\nNow, complicating it, as you well know, is the piracy issue.\nFEINGOLD: Right.\nCLINTON: There's been a number of consultations about piracy. The current thinking is that pirates will be intercepted and defended against as a kind of joint responsibility between the private shippers, who have to do more, frankly, for their own -- the security of their own vessels, but also various navies that are, you know, coming together, including China and India, who are -- are willing to patrol the waters.\nThere is also some talk about going ashore -- this is a problem Thomas Jefferson dealt with along the Barbary Coast, you know, kind of going to prove that the more things change, the more they stay the same. You know, there are some who are advocating going ashore on Somalia.\nWe have to give a lot of thought to this, and there is an enormous number of bad options that have to be sorted through. So I -- I am not at all able to give you the new administration's policy, because we're sorting it out ourselves.\nFEINGOLD: I can tell you're eager and very ready to take this on.\nCLINTON: Yes, indeed.\nFEINGOLD: So I look forward to working with you.\nLet me switch to something completely different. There's widespread recognition of the need to build a more robust and effective diplomatic and development corps.\nAnd as a part of that effort, it, of course, makes sense to consider ways to address challenges faced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, particularly relating to domestic partner benefits and State Department policies that make it difficult for the partners of foreign service officers to travel and live at overseas posts. What would you do as secretary of state to address these concerns? Will you support changes to existing personnel policy in order to ensure that LGBT staff at State and USAID receive equal benefits and support?\nCLINTON: Senator, this issue was brought to my attention during the transition. I've asked to have more briefing on it because I think that we should take a hard look at the existing policy. As I understand it, but don't hold me to it because I don't have the full briefing material, but my understanding is other nations have moved to extend that partnership benefit. And we will come back to you to inform you of decisions we make going forward.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you very much. Thanks, Senator. Well, we're sort of getting to that point now where I think we can address some loose ends and maybe even, you know, sort of have some fun and dig into things a little bit here in ways that we can't otherwise. But we promise not to prolong it. And we'll try and remain focused on those things that are really salient here. Let me begin with Afghanistan, if I may. I am deeply concerned that, at least thus far, our policy in Afghanistan has kind of been on automatic. And I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would not see all of our conflicts, ground operations in the context of Vietnam. I really try hard. I have an automatic check that says, you know, not everything is that. But I have to tell you, in the several visits I have now made, escape it as I might, the parallels just really keep leaping out in so many different ways. We are struggling to fight with and for people with a different culture, a different language, different custom, different history, different religion, if any. And all of those similarities exist. We don't live there. We don't live in the community, in a hamlet, in a small town, pocket, whatever you want to call it. And so we're not there often at night. They are. And the night often rules with insurgencies. The complications are profound in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. And I went to both -- and to India -- immediately after Mumbai and was really struck by the extraordinary distance we have to travel in both places, Senator. That is the center of the war on -- I've got check myself. I hope this administration and all of us will begin to think differently in this terminology of war on terror and think in terms of the global counterinsurgency and the difference between counterinsurgency and counterterrorism and the challenges that we face in addressing both and understanding them both. One person made a very interesting comment to me while I was over there and said, you know, Pakistan is a government without a country, and Afghanistan is a country without a government. And if you stop and think about -- so the real application -- and no insult meant to anybody. President Karzai is a friend. We've all met with him. We want his success. But there are inherent contradictions in the structure that we have been trying to impose in Afghanistan. And more and more, as I travel that part of the world -- I served most recently as chair of the Subcommittee on Mideast, South Asia -- so I was frequently there. It left -- it kept leaping out at me in ways that, over a number of years here, I really, frankly had not given enough consideration to. But recently read a wonderful book when I commend to you by Rory Stewart, you know, \"The Places in Between\" and another book, \"The Forever War\" and a whole host of them that really give you the flavor of this if you really want it -- I mean, \"Gertrude Bell, the Desert Queen\" is a fascinating study of sort of the region and of tribalism. And that's really what I want to point to. We have not, I think -- we honored tribalism when we dealt with the Northern Alliance and initially went in to Afghanistan. We really haven't adequately since. And it strikes me that if we just put troops, plunk them down, another 20, 30,000 in Afghanistan, without very limited view of what they can achieve and need to do and a comprehensive view of other things we need to do to build the successful structures of governance -- the police, the judiciary which may be a pipe dream, the construction programs, the ability of Hamid Karzai's government, as well intentioned as he may be and as much as we like him, the ability to even get out of Kabul and be able to do anything in the countryside, I think -- Madam Secretary Designate, we're on the wrong track. And I think unless we rethink this very, very carefully, we could raise the stakes, invest America's reputation in a greater way as well as our treasure and wind up pursuing a policy that is, frankly, unpursuable, unachievable. So I'd like to elicit your thoughts on this. I was in Pasharah (ph) a few weeks ago. I learned that -- and some in Pakistan would disagree with this, and I'll probably hear from some of my friend there. But many people believe that it would not be hard for the Taliban to move in there if that's the decision they decided to make. It was so dangerous that we were not able to move into the downtown and other areas. And we just saw last week 600 Taliban cross the border from Afghanistan and came in and directly attacked a frontier corps military outpost. I have anybody who has really traveled on the ground, listened in the right ways, and not just accepted the sort of briefing culture will suggest to you respectfully, Madam Secretary, this really has to be rethought very, very carefully. Our original goal was to go in there and take on Al Qaeda. It was to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. It was not to adopt the 51st state of the United States. It was not to try to impose a form of government, no matter how much we believe in it and support it, but that is -- that is the mission, at least, as it is being defined today. So I'd like to ask for your thoughts on this as you engage in what will, obviously, be a hasty and important critical review and some judgments that we need to make about our policy.\nCLINTON: Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that your cautions are extremely well taken. There is, as you know, a review going on right now under the direction of General Petraeus through CENTCOM. If I understand it, he has approximately 300 people, some of them detailees from the State Department, who are crisscrossing Afghanistan trying to determine, as I understand it, what is and isn't feasible. We are in close communication with General Petraeus. We intend to, when it's appropriate on January 20th, to begin our own immediate review because I share your concern as I know the president-elect does. You know, his approach toward Afghanistan, which is has been more for more -- you know, more troops would go in but there would have to be more from NATO and there would have to be more from Afghanistan -- you know, presupposes that we have a set of discreet goals that we are trying to achieve. And that is in the process of being assessed and analyzed right now. As you're aware, President Bush had inside the White House General Lute, who was largely responsible for coordinating policy with respect to both Iraq and Afghanistan. So the Bush administration has put a lot of assets to work on trying to determine what is the best way forward with Afghanistan and how do we affect the future of Pakistan, the decisions that they make. But I think that asking the hard questions and raising the red flags is exactly what this committee I know will do and should do. Sitting here today, when I think about my trips to Afghanistan, my flying over that terrain, my awareness of the history going back to Alexander the Great and, certainly, the imperial British military and Rudyard Kipling's memorable poems about Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, which put in more troops than we're thinking about putting in -- I mean, it calls for a large doze of humility about what it is we are trying to accomplish. Having said that, I think that we will keep you informed as we move forward. And on the civilian side, I hope that we will have the opportunity for more in-depth conversations. I mean, I've been on both sides now of the table here. And there is so much to discuss, and there is so much expertise on this committee -- people who have traveled widely, thought deeply, know a lot of the players. And I hope that, you know, if I am confirmed, that I'll be able to have you and others literally sitting down and talking with the people that we're going to be tasking to come up with the civilian side of this strategy so that we go in with our eye open, whatever it is we're trying to achieve.\nKERRY: Well, I really appreciate that. I don't expect you to be able to lay out that strategy now. I would say that I think it's important, perhaps, for the administration -- the incoming administration -- to not just have the review process that's been put in place be the only standard for a baseline. And I think we need to make certain that there's a subsequent expectation with regard to that. I think it would be a mistake to just do that. I think you probably agree with that. Secondly, with respect to the current military operations, I spent a lot of time in a couple of briefings that we're not allowed to discuss in public here. But trying to really get at this question of the targeting with respect to the Pakistan, the Fatah, and our efforts to take out terrorists in that area. There has been a considerable blow-back and, I think, counterproductivity in the collateral damage that has been occurring there. And I hope that you would also agree to really dig into that and take a look at whether or not all of that, the targeting, is in fact as purported to be and as important as is suggested because I think we're creating some terrorists and losing some ground in the effort to win the hearts and minds as they say.\nCLINTON: Yes, sir.\nKERRY: On the situation with Pakistan, they not only face the challenge of the insurgency in the country; they have a dire economic crisis also. And in many ways, the economic crisis may be just as challenging. We, after I went over with Senator Biden and Senator Hagel last year, we came back and propped a tripling of the aid to $1.5 billion a year over the course of a number of years. And I wonder, can you say today that the administration is -- remaining absolutely committed to that because we want to try to move that as rapidly as we can?\nCLINTON: Yes. The president-elect does support the regulation that you were part of and Vice President-elect Biden and, I think, Senator Lugar was as well.\nKERRY: Correct.\nCLINTON: And we want it try to begin, to some extent, to separate our military aid from our non-military aid. The tripling of the non-military aid is intended to provide resources that will both support the Pakistani people but also give some tools to the democratically-elected government to try to start producing results for the people of Pakistan. The military aid, we want to, you know, really look hard at seeing whether we can condition some of that on the commitment for the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism missions. So we certainly are inclined to support, when appropriate, the legislation that you were referring to.\nKERRY: And this is going to take a very significant hands-on effort, as I think you know. We've been, obviously, reading about or hearing about the potential of special envoys, as series of them. Do you want to address that at all today?\nCLINTON: Well, no final decisions have been made. That is a tool that I think you will see more use of. I believe that special envoys, particularly, vis a vis military commands, have a lot to recommend in order to make sure that we've got the civilian presence well represented.\nCLINTON: I believe that special envoys, particularly, vis a vis military commands, have a lot to recommend in order to make sure that we've got the civilian presence well represented and in other areas that are hotspots that will demand so much time that we need to put someone, well experienced, an expert, to work on it.\nSo we are working through that and, again, this is an area that we will be coming back to you with.\nKERRY: I just noticed Senator Vitter is back. I don't want to -- I've gone over my time a little bit, because we were sort of in a wrap-up. Did you -- OK, fine.\nI was stunned in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan to learn that our principal diplomats in that region do not get together to compare notes.\nI was also shocked to learn that our INTEL (NASDAQ:INTC) folks likewise don't do the same. That is just, to me, absolutely mind-boggling.\nCLINTON: Right. Well, Mr. Chairman, these are among the challenges that we intend to take on.\nTrying to create more of a regional perspective and a functional approach instead of being caught in the boxes that people unfortunately too often feel imprisoned by, so that there are certain lines preventing you from actually communicating with your fellow American diplomat across that line or INTEL or whatever.\nI don't have the experience that you have over the years on this committee and even before, but in my travels, I did see the results of that kind of compartmentalization, and we're going to try to break that down.\nWe're going to try to use the bureaus more effectively so that they can be encouraging that. I've been reading up on George Marshall, who made it clear he didn't ever want a memo longer than two pages, and others who have advised me to begin to break down the kind of paper culture that exists and to try to get people more focused on action items, and one of those is more communication back and forth among those who are American representatives in regions of interest and concern to us.\nKERRY: Well, I'm delighted to hear you say that and I think that doing it through the bureaus is precisely an easy way to do and that way you'll know ultimately what is happening, I think. Senator Isakson raised a question about the Hamas political strategy and compared it to Africa, and I just -- I want to flag something for you, because the history of the last years in the Middle East and what's going on in Gaza today and the divisions between Hamas and FATA, the division in the West Bank, in my judgment, reflects, again, a stunning consequence as a lack of engagement and a lack of thinking about sort of common sense of how things work.\nI had the privilege of being in the West Bank the day -- the morning after President Abbas was elected in 2005 and I met with him in Ramallah in that old headquarters and we spent some time together and he looked at me and he said, \"You know, Senator, I know exactly what you expect of me. I have to disarm Hamas. Now, you tell me how I'm supposed to do that. I have no radios, I have no cars, I have no police, and Hamas has the ability to walk up to a door and deliver $20,000 value to somebody who's blown up, widows or orphans of a family of a suicide bomber.\"\nThey deliver the services and we, for years, have talked about the creation of a legitimate partner for peace and yet we've done almost nothing to fundamentally help them deliver that capacity.\nSo my hope is -- I mean, I fear -- I mean, Israel has all the right in the world and we are totally supportive of the patience they've shown, the forbearance, over 10,500 rockets, the fact that Hamas broke the ceasefire. We understand the need to deal with Hamas, but we also have to recognize the threat here that Hamas may, in fact, wind up being more powerful than FATA as a consequence.\nAnd the question is: has this further set back the ability to create that legitimate partner for peace? Would you comment perhaps on -- you did a little bit in your opening, but I think it would be worthwhile getting a better sense of how you see the play there and the end game, if you will, with respect to Hamas.\nCLINTON: Well, you know, we are at a point where the current administration is working very hard behind the scenes and in front of the scenes and we don't want to say or do anything that might interrupt or undermine what they are doing.\nI think your point, though, is incredibly important and that's why earlier I mentioned the work that General Jones had done, in which he was part of a bottoms-up approach, working with Abbas, Fayed and others in the West Bank, and there were results.\nThat's what's so tragic is that more effort earlier, more sustained, more targeted, it got to the point where the Israeli defense force was willing to turn over security to members of the Palestinian force that had been under the training of this team that General Jones put together.\nKERRY: General Dayton and...\nCLINTON: Yes. General Dayton was on the ground. There is so much more we have to do and, obviously, we do support Israel's right to defend itself and we do understand and appreciate what it must be like to be subjected to rocket attacks.\nAnd Hamas did break the ceasefire and they have no intention, at least so far as we can tell, of entering into another ceasefire at this moment and the rockets are still being launched.\nSo I think that working toward a durable ceasefire is going to be an initial challenge if it's not achieved by the time that the president-elect takes office.\nBut that's not the answer. The answer is how do we begin to rebuild some sense of cooperation and, dare I say, even trust and confidence-building measures so we can get back to this work of the slow, but steady building of the capacity of the Palestinian Authority.\nSo I know that General Jones is very committed to that. I share that commitment and we intend to look into that as soon as we are able.\nKERRY: Well, I know that's going to be a high priority. I know you've already been meeting on it and I don't think we need to belabor it here now. But we wish you well with that and, obviously, want to try to be as helpful as we can.\nJust two quick last issues. Are there any other questions? I'm going to sort of wrap.\nOne thing I do want to ask, if I may, and I don't want to belabor it, but it's coming at us enormously and that is the question of what we're really going to be able to do here with respect to global climate change.\nI was in (INAUDIBLE) in a meeting and I met with all of the delegations that I had met with in Kyoto and Rio in various years and it is stunning to see the transformation on those meetings, particularly with the Chinese and with the low islands, the small islands representatives and with the Indonesians and others, with Brazilians with respect to forests and so forth.\nThey are scared. They are serious. And what struck me is the degree to which everybody is waiting for us to take a lead. Now, I say that in one particular context.\nRecently, a group of our top scientists have run computer models and it shows that we are well ahead in terms of the effects of global climate change of all of the IPC studies today.\nEvery single study shows that today our rate of increase of emissions is way beyond what is supportable. In the last ten years, we are increasing emissions, not decreasing them, four times as fast as we were in the 1990s.\nMore chilling is the computer modeling they did against the current plans of every single country that is planning to do anything, and it's not that big a group. The European community has a 2020 date of reductions. The Chinese have a reduction of intensity, not a specific reduction of emissions.\nThe other countries individually have either set a loose 2020 goal. Some, like us, have set a 2050 goal, but 80 percent reduction under the Obama plan, but not yet implemented, not yet real.\nThey took all of these current projections and ran the computer models against what is currently happening in the science and in every single case, it showed that we are not just marginally above a catastrophic tipping point level. We are hugely significantly above it.\nScientists have now revised the levels of supportable greenhouse gas emissions from 550 parts per million to 450 to now 350. This had emissions at over 600. This had a temperature increase of in the range of three to five, six degrees if we do business as usual over the next few years.\nThe results, and I'm not going to go through them all now, but the results are on every single level of sea ice species, forest migration, drought, storms, disease, refugees, I mean, you start adding it up.\nThe consequences in terms of national security, human condition on this planet, are simply catastrophic. They're devastating.\nSo our challenge is going to be even greater than it was five months ago, Senator, or two months ago. The perception that we can kind of creep at this and perhaps do something this year, notwithstanding our economy, is foolhardy.\nAnd so I hope -- I just flag it for you. I know that the president-elect has said he's going to focus on it. But I'm not sure that everybody coming into the administration is completely aware of what a big lift this is going to be and how imperative it is that we make Copenhagen a success.\nI simply want to ask your undivided focus and leadership on this issue, because it is that critical.\nCLINTON: Well, Mr. Chairman, you will have it, because I share your deep concern. You were eloquent in describing it and you've been a leader in trying to sound the alarm on it for many years.\nAs I've said, we will have a climate change envoy negotiator, because we want to elevate it and we want to have one person who will lead our international efforts. But I agree completely that our credibility leading internationally will depend, in large measure, on what we're able to accomplish here at home.\nAnd as we heard the president-elect earlier at lunch, he will be putting forth a stimulus package that will have some energy, renewable energy provisions. So I think that's a good start and we have a lot of work to do. KERRY: Senator Menendez, did you have any additional questions? You did.\nMENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI was listening to some of the previous questions and I just want to make sure, since I made a statement earlier today, that I'm right and if I'm not, I'm happy to correct it for the record.\nIt is my understanding that participants and contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative have been publicly disclosed since its inception and that that will continue to be disclosed.\nIs that a factual statement or am I wrong?\nCLINTON: That is correct, Senator.\nMENENDEZ: And those contributors have been listed in all types from press releases to event materials to a whole host of other ways in which the public has clearly been informed. Is that correct?\nCLINTON: That is correct.\nMENENDEZ: Now, it's my understanding, too, when I looked at this, which is why I didn't dwell upon it in my first round of questioning, that the determination has been made that there is no conflict of interest, but notwithstanding that, that you and President Clinton have been willing to go above and beyond in voluntary actions, as it relates to both law and ethics, to make sure that there is no question.\nIs that a statement of fact?\nCLINTON: That is also correct.\nMENENDEZ: Well, Mr. Chairman, what I would hate to see is some who would put in doubt what I think is an incredibly important opportunity here and that is to have two extraordinary public servants be able to meet the challenges our country has in this world.\nThe Clinton Initiative has made a difference for people, millions of people in this world.\nOne point four million people, Mr. Chairman, now are living a safer life, and living lives longer, and having their lives saved as a result of the HIV/AIDS efforts that that initiative created.\nThe cost of medicine to treat children with HIV/AIDS has dropped by 89 percent over the last two years.\nForty of the world's largest cities are working with the Clinton Initiative to eliminate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, something that the chairman is such a powerful advocate of.\nNearly 3,000 schools are promoting healthier educational environments. I would hate for what Nelson Mandela has said is a global movement where every word spoken, where every partnership discovered, where every promise made can have a direct impact on the lives of millions of people across our planet for generations to come, something that -- the president-elect, Barack Obama, has said that these initiatives help create a model for individual responsibility and collective action to the Clinton Global Initiative, bringing people together to take on tough global challenges.\nIn four years, you have made concrete commitments that have affected over 200 million people in 150 countries. I would hate for that incredible record and opportunity not just of what was done in the past, moving forward, to be blemished by some simply for purposes that are far less substantive and, in my view, a lot more political.\nBut I think it's incredibly important. I know that there are legitimate questions, and I think that those questions have been very well answered.\nBut I can't sit in my office watching what is going on and feel with myself, knowing what this initiative has done for millions of people in this country on things that I critically care about and so many members of this committee have, and let it go at that.\nSo I appreciate your willingness to go above and beyond what is both the law and the ethics. I am sure you will continue to do so. I have expectations as one member of this committee that you will do so.\nAnd I certainly hope that President Clinton's work, while obviously conditioned by the agreements that you have all set out, can still be able to move forward in a way that those people will be able throughout the world to know that America is great because it is good.\nAnd one of its goodnesses is, in fact, what we do through initiatives like President Clinton, like President Carter, and others as well.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nKERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Menendez.\nLet me just say -- I wasn't going to -- I wasn't planning to comment on it, but in light of your comment, I'll just close out pointing out Senator Lugar and I and -- and all of us who have looked at this could not have more respect for CGI, the Clinton Global Initiative, and what it does and has accomplished.\nAnd I couldn't agree with you more with respect to the distinction between that and the questions asked by the senator from Wyoming. That initiative, I think we adequately set forward here, is not at issue, because there will not be fundraising. There will be no foreign donors. And it really doesn't properly fit under the questions asked by Senator Lugar.\nIn fairness to Senator Lugar and to the thinking of the committee -- and I think Senator Clinton understands this full well and I'm confident from her answers that she's articulated a sensitivity to this which is going to have to be judged by the practice, and we're going to have to go forward and see.\nBut there is a legitimate question, and I think, Senator, you'd agree that it's hard to distinguish between a donation currently made and -- and -- and acknowledged publicly and a donation to be made in the future, a commitment made thereto, but not acknowledged publicly.\nAnd so the effort here is not to cast any aspersion on anybody, or to suggest any lack of integrity or anything like that. It is simply to deal with the complicated legal concept of an appearance of a conflict of interest.\nIf you are traveling to some country and you meet with the foreign leadership, and a week later or two weeks later or three weeks later the president travels there and solicits a donation, and they pledge to give at some point in the future, but nobody knows, is there an appearance of a conflict? Could there be an appearance of a conflict?\nThat is what I think Senator Lugar is trying to get at. He has determined that it is simpler simply to adopt one of the options that he's articulated. For reasons you obviously feel are important, and we understand it, you feel otherwise. You have gone beyond the law. You have done things to set up a process.\nAnd really, we're going to have to make the process work, and we're confident that you have put yourself on the line today to make that happen.\nSo that's really where we are.\nMENENDEZ: Mr. Chairman, if I may...\nKERRY: Yes.\nMENENDEZ: ... just very briefly, my concerns, since you couched it in the context of Senator Lugar's questions, is not so much what Senator Lugar posed. I think he did it as he always does, in a very balanced way.\nMy concern is other questions that were raised by other members here.\nKERRY: That's what I was referring to.\nMENENDEZ: Oh.\nKERRY: Oh, no, no, no, I'm referring to that, but I'm simply -- as chair, I want to share in the perceptions, as I have from the beginning, that -- that those are things that we make judgments about, and we honor that and respect that.\nSo let me say that I think this has been a -- a very positive and constructive hearing. I think you have acquitted yourself with great distinction today. I think people are impressed by the versatility and the breadth that you have shown both in the preparation as well as in your own knowledge. We really do anticipate trying to move this as rapidly as we can. And much more importantly, Senator Clinton, we really -- you know, this is an unbelievably important moment for our country, for the world, that waiting for this leadership.\nPresident-elect Obama, you, the administration -- all of us -- are staring at a magnificent opportunity to be able to make America what we believe it can be and should be, and to bring it back, in a sense, in terms of these global efforts.\nAnd we are excited about the prospect of working with you to make that happen. So thank you for your time today, and good luck to you. We look forward to working with you in the days ahead.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, Senator Lugar.\nLUGAR: Thank you.\nKERRY: We stand adjourned.", "timestamp": "2009-01-13", "title": "Senate Confirmation Hearing for Secretary of State Nominee Hillary Clinton"}

President-elect Obama was grateful to President Calderón for his hospitality, for the opportunity to have such warm and productive discussions and for the special tour of the art collection at the Mexican Cultural Institute.\nThere is a long-standing tradition of U.S. presidents meeting with Mexico's president prior to being sworn in, and this meeting was in keeping with that tradition.\nPresident-elect Obama expressed his commitment to advance cooperation on a range of issues, including security, the economy and immigration.\nOn security, President-elect Obama underscored his interest in finding ways to work together to reduce drug-related violence. He applauded the steps that President Calderón has taken to improve security in Mexico and expressed his on-going support for the valuable work being done under the Mérida Initiative. President-elect Obama believes the cooperation under the Mérida Initiative can be a building block for a deeper relationship. President-elect Obama expressed support for efforts in the border states in both the United States and Mexico to eradicate drug-related violence and stop the flow of guns and cash. He told President Calderón that he intends to ask the Secretary of Homeland Security to lead an effort to increase information sharing to strengthen those efforts. He pledged to take more effective action from the United States to stem the flow of arms from the United States to Mexico.\nOn trade and the economy, President-elect Obama said that with both countries facing very difficult economic times, it's important to work together to maintain a constructive and comprehensive dialogue. He expressed his continued commitment to upgrading NAFTA to strengthen labor and environmental provisions to reflect the values that are widely shared in both of our countries, and proposed the creation of a consultative group to work on a host of issues important to the United States and Mexico, including NAFTA, energy and infrastructure. President-elect Obama noted that his economic recovery plan includes substantial investments for port of entry modernization and improvements on the Mexican border to facilitate legal trade and commerce. President-elect Obama told President Calderón that he is impressed by the commitment Mexico made at the Poznan conference and said he hoped our two countries could soon begin conversations about mutually beneficial opportunities in low carbon energy development and carbon abatement opportunities.\nPresident-elect Obama underscored his commitment to working with Congress to fix the broken U.S. immigration system and fostering safe, legal and orderly migration. He expressed his strongly held view that immigrants should be treated with dignity and that the immigration debate should not be a vehicle for vilifying any group, and that our two countries need to work more effectively to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the United States.\nPresident Calderón was joined in the meeting by Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinosa, Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont, Treasury Secretary Agustín Carstens and Ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan.\nPresident-elect Obama was joined by Chief of Staff Designee Rahm Emanuel, National Security Advisor Designee General Jim Jones (Ret.) and White House National Economic Council Director-Designee Lawrence Summers.\nThe meeting was held over lunch at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington, DC, and lasted for one and a half hours. Following the meeting, President Calderón and President-elect Obama walked through the José Clemente Orozco Gallery which houses an important collection of Mexican art, including works by Robert Cueva Del Río, Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros.", "timestamp": "2009-01-12", "title": "Statement by Incoming White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on the Meeting Between President-Elect Obama and President Calderón"}

I did so because, in consultation with the business community and my top economic advisers, it is clear that the financial system, although improved from where it was in September, is still fragile.\nAnd I felt that it would be irresponsible for me, with the first $350 billion already spent, to enter into the administration without any potential ammunition, should there be some sort of emergency or weakening of the financial systems.\nWhen this initial vote was approved by Congress, I think there were expectations of clarity and transparency and openness in how the program would be managed.\nThere were expectations that we would deal directly with housing and the foreclosure crisis that exists in this country.\nI think many of us have been disappointed with the absence of clarity, the lack of transparency, the failure to track how the money's been spent, and the failure to take bold action with respect to areas like housing, consumer credit, so that we can maintain credit flows, small businesses, students who need student loans, people who are interested in buying a car, getting car loans, that, in all sorts of ways, Main Street has not seen the effects of these efforts.\nAnd so my commitment is that we are going to fundamentally change some of the practices in using this next phase of the program.\nWe're going to focus on housing and foreclosures. We're going to focus on small businesses. We're going to focus on what's required to make sure that credit is flowing to consumers and businesses, to create jobs in the United States.\nAnd this is going to be part and parcel of a broader financial strategy that involves strengthening the regulations on Wall Street and in our financial sector and our banking sector, so that we're not seeing the kinds of systemic crises that we -- that led us into this situation in the first place.\nSo I just want to let you all know that we are going to be moving forward. I've contacted the leadership, both in the Senate and the House, about this step. And this is one more -- this is one more aspect to a broader approach to reinvigorating our economy that I'm absolutely committed to and that we are going to get done in the weeks and months to come.\nAll right?\nThank you very much, everybody.\nThank you, Mr. Calderon.", "timestamp": "2009-01-12", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect on Funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85391", "text": "We start this new year in the midst of an economic crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime. We learned yesterday that in the past month alone, we lost more than half a million jobs – a total of nearly 2.6 million in the year 2008. Another 3.4 million Americans who want and need full-time work have had to settle for part-time jobs. And families across America are feeling the pinch as they watch debts mount, bills pile up and savings disappear.\nThese numbers are a stark reminder that we simply cannot continue on our current path. If nothing is done, economists from across the spectrum tell us that this recession could linger for years and the unemployment rate could reach double digits – and they warn that our nation could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and standing in the world.\nIt's not too late to change course – but only if we take immediate and dramatic action. Our first job is to put people back to work and get our economy working again. This is an extraordinary challenge, which is why I've taken the extraordinary step of working – even before I take office – with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will call for major investments to revive our economy, create jobs, and lay a solid foundation for future growth.\nI asked my nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, and the Vice President-Elect's Chief Economic Adviser, Dr. Jared Bernstein, to conduct a rigorous analysis of this plan and come up with projections of how many jobs it will create – and what kind of jobs they will be. Today, I am releasing a report of their findings so that the American people can see exactly what this plan will mean for their families, their communities, and our economy.\nThe report confirms that our plan will likely save or create three to four million jobs. 90 percent of these jobs will be created in the private sector – the remaining 10 percent are mainly public sector jobs we save, like the teachers, police officers, firefighters and others who provide vital services in our communities.\nThe jobs we create will be in businesses large and small across a wide range of industries. And they'll be the kind of jobs that don't just put people to work in the short term, but position our economy to lead the world in the long-term.\nWe'll create nearly half a million jobs by investing in clean energy – by committing to double the production of alternative energy in the next three years, and by modernizing more than 75% of federal buildings and improving the energy efficiency of two million American homes. These made-in-America jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, developing fuel-efficient cars and new energy technologies pay well, and they can't be outsourced.\nWe'll create hundreds of thousands of jobs by improving health care – transitioning to a nationwide system of computerized medical records that won't just save money, but save lives by preventing deadly medical errors. And we'll create hundreds of thousands more jobs in education, equipping tens of thousands of schools with 21st century classrooms, labs and computers to help our kids compete with any worker in the world for any job.\nWe'll put nearly 400,000 people to work by repairing our infrastructure – our crumbling roads, bridges and schools. And we'll build the new infrastructure we need to succeed in this new century, investing in science and technology, and laying down miles of new broadband lines so that businesses across our nation can compete with their counterparts around the world.\nFinally, we won't just create jobs, we'll also provide help for those who've lost theirs, and for states and families who've been hardest-hit by this recession. That means bi-partisan extensions of unemployment insurance and health care coverage; a $1,000 tax cut for 95 percent of working families; and assistance to help states avoid harmful budget cuts in essential services like police, fire, education and health care.\nNow, given the magnitude of the challenges we face, none of this will come easy. Recovery won't happen overnight, and it's likely that things will get worse before they get better.\nBut we have come through moments like this before. We are the nation that has faced down war, depression and fear itself – each time, refusing to yield; each time, refusing to accept a lesser fate. That is the spirit that has always sustained us – that belief that our destiny is not written for us, but by us; that our success is not a matter of chance, but of our own courage and determination. Our resources may be finite, but our will is infinite. And I am confident that if we come together and summon that great American spirit once again, we will meet the challenges of our time and write the next great chapter in our American story.", "timestamp": "2009-01-10", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85386", "text": "Good morning. Before I discuss today's announcement, I'd like to say a few words about the latest jobs numbers that we received this morning.\nYesterday, I spoke about the need to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan so that we can jumpstart job creation, invest in our future, and lay a foundation for long-term economic growth. This morning, we received a stark reminder about how urgently action is needed.\nFive hundred and twenty-four thousand jobs were lost in December across nearly all major American industries. That means that our economy lost jobs in all 12 months of 2008 and that nearly 2.6 million jobs lost last year amount to the single worst year of job loss since World War II.\nThe unemployment rate is now well over 7 percent. In addition, we have 3.4 million people who want full-time work but are only able to get part-time work. Clearly, the situation is dire. It is deteriorating and it demands urgent and immediate action.\nMy staff and I have been engaged in a constructive dialogue with members of Congress over the last few days and weeks about my American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan which will save or create 3 million jobs and make long-term investments in critical areas like energy, health care, and education.\nWe've made good progress in these consultations. I look forward to working closely with Congress to shape legislation that will work for the American people. But let me be clear, today's job report only underscores the need for us to move with a sense of urgency and common purpose.\nBehind each and every one of those millions of jobs loss, there are workers and families who are counting on us as they struggle to pay the bills or stay in their homes. There are American dreams that are being deferred and that are being denied because of the current economic climate. There is a devastating economic crisis that will become more come more difficult to contain with time.\nFor the sake of our economy and our people, this is the moment to act and to act without delay.\nNow, I'd like to say a few words about today's appointments. Over the past few weeks, Vice President-elect Biden and I have been working with our national security appointees so that we're ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. Today, I'm pleased to complete our team by announcing my choices to lead the intelligence community and the CIA.\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of good intelligence in the 21st century. When much of our intelligence community was founded, it was focus odd one overarching threat: the Soviet Union. Today, we face a world of unconventional challenges from the spread of stateless terrorist networks and weapons of mass destruction to the grave dangers posed by failed states and rogue regimes. As we learned on 9/11, we are not protected by the distance of an ocean or the ability to deter an enemy. There is no margin for error. To keep our people safe, we must seamlessly collect, analyze, share, and act on information with a sense of urgency. This requires the selfless services of countless patriots and the skillful management of our 16 intelligence agencies.\nGood intelligence is not a luxury, it is a necessity. The men and women of the intelligence community have been on the front lines in this world of new and evolving dangers. They have served in the shadows, saved American lives, advanced our interests, and earned the respect of a grateful nation. There have been sound reforms and many successes built over the last several years.\nBut here in Washington, we've also learned some tough lessons. We've learned that to make pragmatic policy choices, we must insist on assessments grounded solely on the facts and not seek information to suit any ideological agenda. So support those who carry out our intelligence mission, we must give them the resources they need and the clear guidance they deserve.\nAnd we know that to be truly secure, we must adhere to our values as vigilantly as we protect our safety with no exceptions. I'm confident that Dennis Blair and Leon Panetta are the right leaders to advance the work of our intelligence communities. They are public servants with unquestioned integrity, broad experience, strong management skills, and the core pragmatism we need in dangerous times.\nTogether, they will form a team that is uniquely qualified to continue the good work that is being done while making the changes we need to stay ahead of nimble threats and sustain the trust of the American people.\nAdmiral Dennis Blair has seen the diverse uses of intelligence from many different perspectives. Over several decades in uniform, he learned firsthand the necessity of good intelligence for our men and women in uniform. As commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, he developed a deep understanding of the critical importance of Asia and carried out a major offensive against violent extremists.\nAnd as a former NSC staffer and the first associate director of Central Intelligence for Military Support, he is uniquely qualified to bridge -- to build bridges of cooperation among our national security institutions.\nAs DNI, Dennis will be the leader and manager of our intelligence community. He will have my full support as he develops our capabilities, strengthens information gathering and sharing, enhances cooperation with foreign governments, and provides policy makers with the information we need even if it's not always the information that we want.\nAs someone who has handled intelligence as a sailor at sea and a strategic thinker in Washington, he was have the expertise and authority to ensure that our 16 intelligence agencies act with unity of effort and of purpose.\nAdmiral Blair's experience will be exceptionally complimented by Leon Panetta, my choice to be director of the CIA. Leon is one of the finest public servants of our time, and he's committed himself to this country since he put on the uniform of the United States Army.\nAs a congressman, OMB director, and White House chief of staff, he has unparalleled experience in making the institutions of government work better for the American people. He has handled intelligence daily at the very highest levels, and time and again, he has demonstrated sound judgment, grace under fire, and complete integrity.\nLet me be clear, in Leon Panetta, the agency will have a director who has my complete trust and substantial clout. He will be a strong manager and a strong advocate for the CIA. He knows how to focus resources where they are needed, and he has had a proven track record of building consensus and working on a bipartisan basis with Congress.\nI am confident he will strengthen the CIA's capabilities to protect the American people as it continues to adapt to reform our intelligence community.\nI will also rely on the talent and expertise of several distinguished public servants with substantial intelligence experience. The current DNI, Mike McConnell, will continue to offer his counsel through my foreign intelligence advisory board. The National Counterterrorism Center, the hub of our efforts to prevent attacks and root out terrorist networks will continue to benefit from the leadership of Michael Leiter.\nAnd I am pleased to announce that John Brenna, a close adviser, CIA veteran, and former leader of the National Counterterrorism Center, will be my homeland security adviser and deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism serving with the rank of assistant to the president. John has the experience, vision, and integrity to advance America's security.\nThe demands on the intelligence community are huge and growing. To have a successful and sustainable national security strategy, I've made clear that we will need to deploy and balance all elements of American power -- our military, diplomacy, homeland security, economic might, and moral suasion. Good intelligence work is necessary to support each of these endeavors.\nRight now, there are men and women working around the world to bear this burden. We may never know their names, but we will always honor their sacrifice. The task for the team that I've assembled is to guide, support, and integrate their efforts so that we protect our security and safeguard the values that all of us have pledged to uphold.\nWith that, I would like to give Admiral Blair an opportunity to say a few words.\nBLAIR: President-elect Obama, thank you for this opportunity to carry out this responsibility that you have entrusted me with.\nOur mission in national security is absolutely clear. Timely, accurate, relevant intelligence to those who keep this nation safe and to you so that you can make informed national security policy decisions. And it's an honor to lead the U.S. intelligence services.\nAs you stated so well, Mr. President, the American people do not always know about these thousands of men and women who serve with patriotism, with dedication, but without public recognition. They are outstanding public servants.\nAnd we in that group will perform our duties fully and capably and according to law. We will uphold the standards that articulated and that the American people have a right to expect.\nYou've made it very clear, sir, that you are best served by hearing different perspectives and by respectful debate. And the intelligence services will support you with facts, interpretations, assessments in a straightforward manner, and we will tell you how well we know what we know and what we don't know.\nSo I deeply appreciate the opportunity to lead our intelligence services and, if confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to joining the national security team.\nAnd as President-elect Obama has said, Leon Panetta's achievements have been remarkable. His services at the top level of the executive branch and in the Congress combine leadership and wisdom and, in this business, we will count on him for both. I could not ask for a better leader of the Central Intelligence Agency, one of the key agencies within our intelligence community.\nLeon, with your background and perspective, the skilled professionals on your team, the agency is in superb hands. And so I welcome your counsel and support as together we seek to serve the president.\nThank you.\nPANETTA: Thank you, Mr. President-elect, for this honor and this opportunity to, once again, serve our great country.\nThroughout my 40 years in public life, I've had the honor and the privilege of serving this nation in a number of capacities. In recent years, my wife Sylvia and I established the Panetta Institute whose mission is to inspire young people to lives of public service.\nSurely, we can now do no less. Particularly at a time when our national security is threatened, I believe it is important to respond again to this call to duty like so many other brave Americans have done.\nAnd it's because of them that I will work tirelessly to defend this nation and to provide you, Mr. President-elect, with the most accurate and objective intelligence that you need to lead this nation at a time of great peril but also a time of great opportunity. The Central Intelligence Agency has a rich and proud history. As you referenced, the professionals at CIA serve bravely around the world, many in dangerous places and away from their families, often undercover, sometimes under fire.\nThey are the front line of our defense at a very dangerous time and they deserve and will have my complete confidence and support. Strong intelligence requires a strong team, and I look forward to working with Admiral Blair, John Brennan, as well as the other many talented and dedicated men and women of our intelligence community.\nAnd I look forward to working with the other members of your administration, particularly those involved with national security. And I commit to consulting closely with my former colleagues in the Congress to form the kind of partnership we need if we're to win the War on Terror.\nThe inscription on the wall at the old headquarters building at Langley quotes scripture. \"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\"\nIf confirmed, Mr. President-elect, I will be honored to lead the men and women of the CIA to seek and speak the truth. And in so doing, to help preserve this nation's freedom.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: OK. With that, let me take some questions. We'll start with (inaudible) of AP.\nQ: Mr. President-elect, do you believe that your choices for your national security team should signal to the international community any softening of the U.S. stance on Iran? And does it also signal either a reassessment or a crackdown on policies involving harsh interrogation techniques and detention?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: OK. Well, let me start with the second part of the question.\nI was clear throughout this campaign and have been clear throughout this transition that under my administration, the states does not torture. We will abide by the Geneva Conventions that we will uphold our highest values and ideals.\nAnd that is a clear charge that I've given to Admiral Blair and to Leon Panetta. And I think it is important for us to do that not only because that's who we are, but also, ultimately, it will make us safer and will help in changing hearts and minds in our struggle against extremists.\nWith respect to Iran, I'll have more to say about Iran after January 20th. I have said in the past during the course of the campaign that Iran is a genuine threat to U.S. national security. But I have also said that we should be willing to initiate diplomacy as a mechanism to achieve our national security goals.\nAnd my national security team, I think, is reflective of that practical, pragmatic approach to foreign policy. And when we have a policy towards Iran that has been shaped by my national security team, we will release it.\nDebbie Charles from Reuters?\nQ: You had said that you had had constructive dialogue with the members of Congress about -- or your team has -- with members of Congress about the stimulus plan. Are you concerned that -- now, Democrats are voicing some concerns, especially, over the tax part of -- to your tax proposals. Are you worried that this is a harder sell than you had expected?\nAnd does this change the way you might be presenting the package? Is it all going to be in one? Are you going to have to, instead, maybe break it down in bits in order to get it approved?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, let's take a look at what we've achieved so far. And, obviously, I'm not sworn in until January 20th.\nBut we've provided a framework where my incoming administration and Congress share a common set of goals. We have -- there's no disagreement that the economy is in dire straits. There's no disagreement that we need to create jobs. And so the goal that I've set of creating or saving 3 million jobs is one that members of Congress agree with.\nThere's no disagreement that we need action by our government -- a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy. And so having provided the framework, now, we're going to have a consultation. And my staff is up on the Hill as we speak talking to various members of Congress, asking them for their ideas, you know.\nOur expectation is that we will continue to hone and refine our package over the next several weeks. But the one thing that I tried to lay out yesterday to the American people -- and I will continue to insist on -- is we cannot delay. We cannot -- there are going to be a whole host of good ideas out there, and we welcome all of them. And we're going to sift through all of them, and we are going to work in a collaborative fashion with Congress.\nWhat we can't do is drag this out when we just saw half a million more jobs lost. You know, the American people are struggling. And behind the statistics that we see flashing on the screens are real lives, real suffering, real fears. And it is my job to make sure that Congress stays focused in the weeks to come and gets this done.\nAnd I have every expectation that we will get it done.\nQ: (Inaudible)?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Oh, you're assuming that I expected it to be easy.\nQ: Not really.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: No. It's always hard. But I have confidence that we're going to get it done.\nChip Reid?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. I'd like to follow up on that.\nLarry Summers, as you said, is up on the Hill right now, and we're told he's getting an earful from some Democrats who say their plan just isn't big enough. And I know you've resisted putting a number on it, but your staff has talked about a high end of about $800 billion or something like that.\nThey say if that's true and if 40 percent of it is tax cuts that don't have the bang for the buck that spending has, it's not big enough. Paul Krugman, today, said that it's falls far short of what you're going to need to put America back to work.\nHow do you respond to those critics?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, look, there are some people who have said that it's not big enough. There are others who say it's too big.\nQ: (Inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, as I said before, Democrats or Republicans, we welcome good ideas. And so the challenge for all of us, I think, is to identify good ideas, good spending plans that deliver on my commitment to create or save 3 million jobs.\nI want this to work. This is not an intellectual exercise. And there's no pride of authorship. If members of Congress have good ideas, if they can identify a project for me that will create jobs in an efficient way, that does not hamper our ability to, over the long term, get control of our deficit, that is good for the economy, then I'm going accept it.\nIf Paul Krugman has a good idea in terms of how to spend money efficiently and effectively to jumpstart of economy, then we're going to do it. If somebody has an idea for a tax cut that is better than a tax cut we've proposed, we will embrace it.\nSo, you know, one of the things that I think I'm trying to communicate in this process is for everybody to get past the habit that sometimes occurs in Washington of whose idea is it, what ideological corner does it come from -- just show me. If you can show me that something is going to work, I will welcome it.\nIf it works better than something I have proposed, I'll welcome it. What is not an option is for us to sit and engage in posturing or, you know, the standard partisan fights when the American people are out there struggling.\nAnd I don't expect Congress is going to do that because I think that they understand the urgency of the situation and they're hearing from their constituents.\nQ: You said you're going to hone and refine the package, but...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'm sorry?\nQ: You said earlier you're going to hone and refine the package. Are you open to substantially increasing the size of it as it's being described? The spending portion?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, I think that there are going to be a lot of different opinions out there. We're going to take all of them in. And at the end of the day, we're going to have a package that Congress passes and I sign.\nHans Nichols of Bloomberg?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nThroughout the campaign, you talked a lot about changing the way things work in Washington. But I want to go outside of Washington a little bit to some of those foreign embassies and plush ambassadorial residences. Will you be appointing big donors in the time-honored tradition to foreign embassies to serve as ambassadorships? Or will you draw solely from the ranks of career foreign service?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, we have not begun to think about all the ambassadorial appointments that are out there. There are some that are critical that have to be filled immediately, and those are the ones I am focused on.\nFor example, the ambassador to Iraq, you know, I think is very important. Ryan Crocker has done outstanding work, and he's been a remarkable public servant. I think he deserves -- he is one of the unsung heroes in terms of reducing violence in Iraq. But he's been serving there a very long time in a very difficult post.\nAnd so, you know, we're going to have to take a look at the whole host of those critical ambassadorial positions. My general inclination is to have civil service, wherever possible, serve in these posts. And we have outstanding public servants, and I've spoken with secretary of state designee, Hillary Clinton, about the importance of rejuvenating the State Department.\nI want to recruit young people into the State Department to feel that this is a career track that they can be on for the long term. And so, you know, my expectation is that high quality civil servants are going to be rewarded. You know, are there going to be political appointees to ambassadorships? There probably will be some. I don't -- you know, I think it would be -- it would be -- it would be disingenuous for me to suggest that there are not going to be some excellent public servants but who haven't come through -- through the ranks of the civil service.\nBut, you know, as we roll out our ambassadors, I'll you'll be able to make an assessment in terms of the professionalism and high quality of the people that we appoint.\nOK? Thank you, guys.\nQ: (Inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Congratulations to Florida, one of the -- one of my former detail leaders for secret service, their son is a starting -- is a left tackle for Florida. And so I've sent him an e-mail telling him congratulations. I have to point out -- if I'm Utah, if I'm USC, or if I'm Texas, I may still have some quibbles. And you've heard my pitch.\nQ: (Inaudible) number one.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: That's why we need a playoff.\n{LAUGHTER]\nAll right, guys.", "timestamp": "2009-01-09", "title": "Remarks and an Exchange with Reporters Announcing the Nomination of Admiral Dennis Blair as Director of National Intelligence and Leon Panetta as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85361", "text": "Throughout America's history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare. Then there are the years that come along once in a generation – the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past, and set a new course for our nation.\nThis is one of those years.\nWe start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime – a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly two million jobs have now been lost, and on Friday we are likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since World War II. Just in the past year, another 2.8 million Americans who want and need full-time work have had to settle for part-time jobs. Manufacturing has hit a twenty-eight year low. Many businesses cannot borrow or make payroll. Many families cannot pay their bills or their mortgage. Many workers are watching their life savings disappear. And many, many Americans are both anxious and uncertain of what the future will hold.\nI don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this recession could linger for years. The unemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four. We could lose a generation of potential and promise, as more young Americans are forced to forgo dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future. And our nation could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and standing in the world.\nIn short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.\nThis crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the business cycle, and we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come, or relying on the worn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from corporate boardrooms to the halls of power in Washington, DC. For years, too many Wall Street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seeking profits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability. Banks made loans without concern for whether borrowers could repay them, and some borrowers took advantage of cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford. Politicians spent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline, and too often focused on scoring political points instead of the problems they were sent here to solve. The result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our economy, our financial markets, and our government.\nNow, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it is not beyond our ability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future greatness. It will take time, perhaps many years, but we can rebuild that lost trust and confidence. We can restore opportunity and prosperity. We should never forget that our workers are still more productive than any on Earth. Our universities are still the envy of the world. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and the most advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we are still the nation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds. If we act with the urgency and seriousness that this moment requires, I know that we can do it again.\nThat is why I have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jumpstart job creation and long-term growth.\nIt's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we must end the culture of anything goes that helped create it – and this change must begin in Washington. It is time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility. It is time to finally change the ways of Washington so that we can set a new and better course for America.\nThere is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to the budget deficit in the short-term. But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence in our economy. It is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth, but at this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost necessary to lift us from a recession this deep and severe. Only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy – where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs which leads to even less spending; where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit.\nThat is why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need to put money in the pockets of the American people, create new jobs, and invest in our future. That's why we need to re-start the flow of credit and restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like this never happens again.\nThat work begins with this plan – a plan I am confident will save or create at least three million jobs over the next few years. It is not just another public works program. It's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment – the fact that there are millions of Americans trying to find work, even as, all around the country, there is so much work to be done. That's why we'll invest in priorities like energy and education; health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century. That's why the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in the private sector, while our plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, cops, firefighters and others who provide vital services.\nTo finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production of alternative energy in the next three years. We will modernize more than 75% of federal buildings and improve the energy efficiency of two million American homes, saving consumers and taxpayers billions on our energy bills. In the process, we will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced – jobs building solar panels and wind turbines; constructing fuel-efficient cars and buildings; and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs, more savings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain.\nTo improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years, all of America's medical records are computerized. This will cut waste, eliminate red tape, and reduce the need to repeat expensive medical tests. But it just won't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs – it will save lives by reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system.\nTo give our children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been more competitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and public universities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries. We'll provide new computers, new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in Chicago and Boston can compete with kids in Beijing for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future.\nTo build an economy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild America. Yes, we'll put people to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy and needed infrastructure projects. But we'll also do more to retrofit America for a global economy. That means updating the way we get our electricity by starting to build a new smart grid that will save us money, protect our power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation. It means expanding broadband lines across America, so that a small business in a rural town can connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world. And it means investing in the science, research, and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new industries.\nFinally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states, workers, and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession. To get people spending again, 95% of working families will receive a $1,000 tax cut – the first stage of a middle-class tax cut that I promised during the campaign and will include in our next budget. To help Americans who have lost their jobs and can't find new ones, we'll continue the bipartisan extensions of unemployment insurance and health care coverage to help them through this crisis. Government at every level will have to tighten its belt, but we'll help struggling states avoid harmful budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use the money to maintain essential services like police, fire, education, and health care.\nI understand that some might be skeptical of this plan. Our government has already spent a good deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higher incomes or renewed confidence in our economy. That's why the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan won't just throw money at our problems – we'll invest in what works. The true test of the policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're Democratic or Republican ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow our economy, and put the American Dream within reach of the American people.\nInstead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible. Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their tax dollars are being spent. And as I announced yesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessary spending that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and our children's future than it is right now.\nWe have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economy recovers, the deficit starts to come down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people and our businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in order. That's why our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, but a foundation for long-term economic growth.\nThat also means an economic recovery plan that is free from earmarks and pet projects. I understand that every member of Congress has ideas on how to spend money. Many of these projects are worthy, and benefit local communities. But this emergency legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be a time when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own narrow interests.\nNow, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. We must also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system we all depend on. That means using our full arsenal of tools to get credit flowing again to families and business, while restoring confidence in our markets. It means launching a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure crisis so that we can keep responsible families in their homes. It means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse could endanger the entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clear understanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action that must come with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support. And it means reforming a weak and outdated regulatory system so that we can better withstand financial shocks and better protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the reckless greed and risk-taking that must never endanger our prosperity again.\nNo longer can we allow Wall Street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longer can we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales. No longer can we allow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to destructive cycles of bubble and bust.\nIt is time to set a new course for this economy, and that change must begin now. We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but I urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the American people. For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. More families will lose their savings. More dreams will be deferred and denied. And our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.\nThat is not the country I know, and it is not a future I will accept as President of the United States. A world that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and waiting for America to lead once more. And that is what we will do.\nIt will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worse before they get better. But that is all the more reason for Congress to act without delay. I know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation. We have already tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach that helped lead us to this day of reckoning.\nThat is why the time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work and responsibility are once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Congress to work with me and my team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next few weeks. That's why I'm calling on all Americans – Democrats and Republicans – to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles; a sense of common purpose above the same narrow partisanship; and insist that the first question each of us asks isn't \"What's good for me?\" but \"What's good for the country my children will inherit?\"\nMore than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront this challenge with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down war, depression, and fear itself. And if we do – if we are able to summon that spirit again; if are able to look out for one another, and listen to one another, and do our part for our nation and for posterity, then I have no doubt that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one of those years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for the United States of America.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85387", "text": "Good afternoon.\nWhen I launched my campaign for the presidency, I knew we setting out on an improbable journey. But I also knew that if we ran a different kind of campaign, if we engaged young voters for the first time, and older voters for the first time in a very long time, if we united Democrats and Republicans and independents from red states as well as blue states, if we rallied the entire Nation around a common purpose, then we would not only build a strong campaign, but we would build a movement for change. With the support of ordinary men and women who gave whatever time and money they could spare, we did just that. And that's why we can truly call our success on November 4th not just a Democratic victory, but an American victory.\nOn the other hand, it would be a mistake to take our success in the campaign as a sign that our work is somehow complete. At a time when the challenges we face in this country are so vast, we cannot afford to abandon the movement we've built. We have to strengthen it.\nWe must build a movement for change that can endure beyond a single election, and that will require redoubling our efforts to reach out to Americans throughout our 50 states, north and south, east and west. It will require finding candidates for elective office whose policies and plans are rooted not in ideology, but in what works.\nAnd it will require shedding our ingrained habits of taking money from federal lobbyists and special interests, and relying instead on small donations from ordinary Americans.\nWe're in a strong position to rebuild a Democratic Party committed to these principles because of the outstanding work of its current chairman, Howard Dean.\nFor nearly four years, Howard has served our party and our nation as a visionary and effective leader. He launched a 50-state strategy that made Democrats competitive in places they had not been in years, working with my chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, to give Democrats a majority in the House for the first time in over a decade.\nHaving steered the Democratic Party through two successful elections, Howard deserves enormous credit for helping usher in a new era in Washington.\nAnd now is the time not only to build on Howard's record of achievement, but to remake the Democratic Party to meet the challenges of the 21st century. And no one is better suited to help lead this effort than the new chairman of the DNC, my good friend, Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia.\nTim comes from Virginia, a state that reflects America, where people of all backgrounds and walks of life, big cities and small towns, and a growing population come together.\nBut in a state so diverse, Tim has been a successful candidate and a successful governor, not by appealing to our divisions, but by appealing to our common hopes, not by pursuing policies that advance any dogma, but by pursuing policies that work for the people of Virginia.\nTim and I share a philosophy. It's a pragmatic, progressive philosophy that was at the heart of my campaign and will be at the heart of this administration. It's a philosophy that measures the strength of an idea not by whether it's Republican or Democrat, but whether it can actually solve a problem and make a difference in people's lives. Tim knows that breaking free of the old orthodoxies and reaching across party lines isn't just a way to build a Democratic Party that's more open and inclusive; it's a way to achieve progress for all Americans.\nHe understands that, while politics is tough and we need to fight hard for our ideals and our values, we also need to work together to solve our common problems. That's how he built what has become a model of good and responsible government in the commonwealth of Virginia.\nAs governor, Tim's promoted smart growth reforms to help traffic move better and improve the quality of life in our communities, ramped up the number of children getting health care and a pre-K education, and invested in schools while holding them more accountable.\nUnder his watch, Virginia has become one of America's leading centers of innovation, creating new jobs, building new industries, and seizing the opportunities of a 21st-century economy.\nIn the end, what will make Tim such an outstanding DNC chairman is not just his ability to win campaigns by bringing people together or his recognition that we need new, more pragmatic approaches to meet the challenges of our time.\nIt's his belief that politics is about something more than what all too often it's become in Washington, that it's not about enriching corporate friends or feeding partisan disputes or getting your name in the papers, but about the dignity of service.\nThat's the kind of leadership he will bring to the Democratic Party. That's the kind of leadership the Democratic Party will bring to America.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: So, with that, let me just introduce very briefly the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Governor Tim Kaine.\nGOV. TIM KAINE (D-VA.): Well, thank you, President-elect Obama. It is such a treat to be here today and accept this honor.\nI will say about you, that you proved to me in this discussion what you proved to Americans on November 4, that you are a very persuasive individual. And I am -- I'm thrilled to accept the opportunity and humbled, as well.\nI signed on to Barack Obama's campaign for presidency in February of 2007, early, with a great deal of confidence in him as the person who should be the leader of what I believed would be a very challenging time for our nation that we're now in.\nAnd I'm so proud of the campaign that he ran, the policies that he advocated, and proud of my native state of Virginia, which supported him in a very unusual way, after not having supported a Democratic candidate for 44 years.\nI want to thank the president-elect for his confidence in me. I have been honored to serve 15 years in elected -- in elective office, entering my last year as governor of Virginia, and I pledge to do my very best to continue to keep his trust in this very important job.\nI hope to do three things as DNC chair. I want to promote this president's agenda. I want to carry the proud banner of a proud party. And I want to work to creatively engage citizens in new ways through this party to be active in civic life.\nIn promoting the president's agenda, we're at a crossroads time for this nation. It is truly a time of momentous import as we confront challenging economic circumstances in a troubled international environment.\nAll Americans, however they voted on November 4th, have a huge stake in this presidency being successful. And so I will be a passionate and positive promoter of President Obama's agenda. And that will be my first goal as DNC chair.\nMy second goal is to carry a proud banner for a proud party. The Democratic Party has a long pedigree and the basic values, the best of what being a Democrat is about, belief in the equality of all, the lifting and leveling power of education, the dignity of work, the power of innovation in America, our responsibilities to each other, especially to the least of these, and internationally that we're strong when we're strong militarily and economically, but that we also have to be strong diplomatically and in our moral example.\nThose are the basic values of the Democratic Party that I cherish and that Americans of all parties cherish those values, as well.\nIn Virginia, we've managed to do some good as Democrats. When I started as a statewide candidate in state politics in 2000, our party was moribund, but we, beginning with a great leader, Mark Warner, Jim Webb, so many other great Democrats, we've won a lot of seats, but we haven't done it because of the letter after our name. We've done it because we have made the party in Virginia, working every day, a party of problem-solvers and unifiers.\nWe're not the ideologues, the obstructionists, the gridlock folks. We're the problem-solvers.\nAnd we're not the dividers. In Virginia, we've rejected the politics of negativity, the politics that, you know, often energizes the 51 percent by beating up on the 49 percent, and instead try to unify people. And so that will be the same model that I will try to carry here at DNC chair as I carry the banner for this great party.\nAnd, finally, the thing I'm most excited about, being able to engage Americans in -- in new ways in politics. Chairman Dean, with the 50-state strategy here at the DNC, has just done a remarkable job, as the president-elect said, in recognizing that we can't be a regional party or a party of a few states that might get us to 270 electoral votes, but that we've got to be a party that plays everywhere.\nAnd what a remarkable job he did in his four-year tenure. I've got huge shoes to fill.\nAnd then Senator Obama in his campaign, they campaigned in truly a different way. I remember early in the campaign, a friend of mine in Virginia said, \"Well, he's good on the inspiration.\" But I thought, \"You know, you just don't see it, because at the end of the day, the story of this campaign was less about the inspiration than about the organization,\" an organization around what I think is a pretty basic principle, the principle that everybody matters.\nYou don't have to be a big donor for your donation to matter. You don't have to be a Ph.D. or a foreign policy expert for your idea to matter. And you don't have to be a full-time campaign worker for your effort to matter.\nAnd so if we could engage people as we did in this campaign in remarkable ways -- many coming in to politics for their first time, many without a party affiliation who just felt excited that a candidate was offering them a chance to engage -- we can do the same thing in politics not just around election cycles, but also around making change, changes that this president wants in our economy, in our health care system, in our need to find a brighter and cleaner energy future. And so in those three areas, I'm going to do my best. For my friend -- I consider Barack a great friend. I can -- I'll call him Barack until January 18th, and then thereafter there will be a different title.\nBut I am -- I'm very, very humbled at this opportunity and excited to take it on. And we'll do great work together.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Thank you, guys.", "timestamp": "2009-01-08", "title": "Remarks Announcing the Appointment of Tim Kaine as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85356", "text": "Good morning. By now we know we are facing a crisis in our economy, one that requires immediate and decisive action to spur the creation of new jobs as we lay the foundation of future growth.\nAnd with the American recovery and reinvestment plan that Congress will soon be debating, we intend to deliver that change.\nBut during the course of this campaign, during the course of the last two years, I committed to more change than that. We committed to changing the way our government in Washington does business. So that we're no longer squandering billions of tax dollars on programs that have outlived their usefulness or exist solely because of the power of a lobbyist or an interest group.\nWe can no longer afford to sustain the old ways, when we know there are new and more efficient ways of getting the job done. Even in good times, Washington can't afford to continue these bad practices. In bad times, it's absolutely imperative that Washington stop them and restore confidence that our government is on the side of taxpayers and everyday Americans.\nJust today, the Congressional Budget Office announced that the deficit we are inheriting from this budget year will be $1.2 trillion. And we know that our recovery and reinvestment plan will necessarily add more. My own economic and budget team projects that unless we take decisive action, even after our economy pulls out of its slide, trillion-dollar deficits will be a reality for years to come.\nAs I said yesterday, our problem is not just a deficit of dollars, it's a deficit of accountability, and a deficit of trust. So change and reform can't just be election-year slogans. They must become fundamental principles of government. And that's why the appointment I'm announcing today is among the most important that I will make.\nDuring the campaign, I said that we must scour this budget. Line by line, eliminating what we don't need or what doesn't work, and improving the things that do.\nAs the first chief performance officer working with Peter Orszag and Rob Nabor at the Officer of Management and Budget, Nancy Killefer is uniquely qualified to lead that effort. For nearly 30 years, as a leader of McKenzie & Company and as assistant secretary for management, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Treasury under President Clinton, nancy has built a career out of making major American corporations and public institutions more effective, more efficient, and more transparent.\nNancy is an expert in streamlining processes, and wringing out inefficiencies so that taxpayers and consumers get more for their money. And during her time at Treasury, she helped bring the department into the 21st century, modernizing the IRS, and preparing systems for Y2K.\nBut Nancy also understands that at the end of the day, government services are delivered by people. That's why she's always worked tirelessly to empower employees to take matters into their own hands, to rethink outmoded ways of doing things, to embrace new systems and technologies, and to take initiative in developing better practices.\nWhen Nancy was offered her first position at Treasury, she responded, and I quote, \"...if you are willing to embrace significant change, then you're looking at the right person. But if you just want to keep the trains running on time, don't ask me to do this job.\"\nWhen I heard that, I knew I had chosen exactly the right person for the challenges we face. And I will be instructing members of my cabinet and key members of their staffs to meet with Nancy soon after we take office. And on a regular basis thereafter, to discuss how they can run their agencies with greater efficiency, transparency and accountability.\nI will also see to it that we apply these principles of budget reform to the economic recovery and reinvestment plan. This plan will call for dramatic investments to revive our flag in the economy. Save or create three million jobs, mostly in the private sector. And lay a solid foundation for future growth.\nIn order to make these investments that we need, we'll have to cut the spending that we don't. And I'll be relying on Nancy to help guide that process. In the end, though, meeting the challenges of rebuilding our economy and bringing a new sense of responsibility to Washington isn't just about rearranging numbers on a balance sheet. It's about rewarding people's trust and restoring that trust in their leadership. Beccause in order to restore confidence in our economy, we must restore the American people's confidence in their government, that it's on their side, spending their money wisely, to meet their family's needs. I'm confidence that with Nancy's leadership and the efforts of leaders on both sides of the aisle, we will do just that. And with that, let me give Nancy an opportunity to speak.\nKILLEFER: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. I'm deeply honored to be selected as the nation's first chief performance officer, and will do my best to create a government that works better for its citizens.\nMost of the operational issues that the government faces today have developed over decades, and will take time to address. But there is an urgency to begin now.\nI know from my experience bringing about change in the private and public sectors that government has the capacity to deliver services more efficiently and effectively. I have seen it done.\nAnd I have seen it important to work across bureaucratic boundaries. By that I mean to get different parts of government working together to deliver services that consumers, its citizens, deserves.\nThe people who deliver those services, the government employees themselves, will be central to this effort. I am convinced that the success of every policy of this administration will be influenced by the people executing it. And I am committed to engaging and drawing on the talents of the federal work force in order to deliver on our promise of a new, more efficient and effective government.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: All right. With that, let me take a couple of questions. We'll start with Laura Meklynn (ph), Wall Street Journal.\nThere you are. How are you?\nLAURA MEKLYNN, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Mr. President-elect, budget experts agree that the real key to controlling spending lies with the entitlement program.\nHow early do you plan on addressing Medicare and Social Security, and what will your approach be?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, as I noted in my remarks, we're going to be inheriting a trillion-plus dollar deficit. And if we do nothing, then we will continue to see red ink as far as the eye can see.\nAnd at the same time, we have an economic situation that is dire. And we're going to have to jump start this economy with my economic recovery plan, creating three million jobs. That's going to cost some money.\nAnd in the short-term, we will actually see potentially additions to the deficit. As you point out, the key is going to be medium-term and long-term, how do we bend the curve so that we start getting these deficits down to a manageable level? And entitlements are going to be a part of that. We will -- we are working currently on our budget plans. We are beginning consultations with members of Congress around how we expect to approach the deficit. We expect that discussion around entitlements will be a part, a central part, of those plans.\nAnd I would expect that by February, in line with the announcement of at least a rough budget outline, that we will have more to say about how we're going to approach entitlement spending, how we're going to approach eliminating waste in government, one of Nancy's tasks. So we will have some very specific outlines in terms of how it's going to be done.\nChuck Todd.\nCHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. The situation in Gaza is getting worse. Fighting has resumed (INAUDIBLE) this morning. I understand your response has been, one president at a time. You can't say anything that is not the way you have handled the economic situation.\nAnd with it getting worse, is it important for you to send a message to the Arab world right now that you are involved in the cease-fire talks, that your national security team is working with the Bush administration national security team, rather than just getting updates?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yes, look. I will repeat what I've said before. We can't have two administrations running foreign policy at the same time. We simply can't do it. And so, as a consequence, what I am doing is I am being briefed consistently. My national security team is fully up to speed on it.\nBut the situation of domestic policymaking and foreign policymaking are two different things. We cannot be sending a message to the world that there are two different administrations conducting foreign policy. That is not safe for the American people.\nObviously, I am deeply concerned about the status of what's going to be taking place, what's been taking place in Gaza. And as I said yesterday, I am doing everything that we have to do to make sure that the day that I take office, we are prepared to engage immediately in trying to deal with the situation there.\nAnd not only the short-term situation, but building a process whereby we can achieve a more lasting peace in the region. But until I take office, it would be imprudent of me to start sending out signals that somehow we are running foreign policy when I am not legally authorized to do so.\nTODD: Do you think the Palestinians, though, are interpreting your silence in a certain way?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Chuck, the -- there are -- I can't control how people interpret what I'm saying, other than to repeat what I've said, and hope that they hear what I'm -- hear my message.\nThe silence is not as a consequence of a lack of concern. In fact, it's not silence. I've explained very clearly exactly what institutional constraints I'm under when it comes to this issue. OK?\nJake.\nJAKE TAPPER, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. Welcome to Washington.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Oh, it's great to be here.\nTAPPER: Your team has talked about the stimulus package being $675 to $775 billion. But at the same time, you have distributed a memo -- you're going to distribute a memo in which economists say it should be between $8 billion -- I'm sorry, $800 billion and $1.3 trillion. How do you reconcile that difference, and also, could you explain what you consider to be truly stimulative, when any project will create jobs in the short term?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, we are still in consultation with members of Congress about the final size of the package. We expect that it will be on the high end of our estimates, but will not be as high as some economists have recommended because of the constraints and concerns we have about the existing deficit.\nIn terms of the components of the package, as I've made clear over last several days, we're going to have a investment component designed to create or save 3 million new jobs. Part of what the charge of my team has been is to figure out how can we make sure that even as we're creating short-term jobs and spurring demand in the economy, that we're also laying the groundwork for long-term economic growth, which is why a lot of the stimulative -- a lot of the investments are going to be around things like energy, health care, education, things that we need to be doing anyway.\nPart of the stimulus package will be to provide tax relief to middle- income families, and where it makes sense and is going to work, to provide some tax relief to businesses to spur on investment in the private sector. And part of the package is going to be to help states who are under extraordinary budget pressures, to prevent them from laying off more workers in vital service areas like teaching, law enforcement, and so forth, so that not only are we saving jobs, we're also making sure that states are able to provide basic services to their citizens at a time of critical need.\nIn terms of what I consider appropriate stimulus, you know, the criteria that we've tried to lay out is, are we able to use this money wisely, effectively, in a two-year time span so that we're not creating long-term obligations that would add to the structural deficit that exists, but would provide an immediate boost to the economy.\nAnd as I indicated yesterday, one of the things that I think is important is that we do not have earmarks in this package. I've said before, I think it's entirely appropriate for members of Congress to want to have some say in terms of projects that take place in their district. Many of the projects that they might advocate for are worthy. But this isn't the place to do it. And so I think it's important for us not to have earmarks here. It's important for us to have transparency in how the money is spent. I intend to make sure that we have unprecedented measures to ensure that taxpayers can keep track of how this money is spent.\nSo if, you know, we can get this done quickly, then I have confidence that not only are we going to be able to create jobs, but we're also going to be making a down payment on some critical areas that, as the economy recovers and the private sector starts investing again, we're going to see some long-term benefits and long-term savings.\nAnd I'll just take one example. Part of our stimulus package is going to involve revamping all federal buildings so that they're energy- efficient. If we do that effectively, then over the long term, we are going to save billions of dollars in energy costs for the federal government and for taxpayers. That's the kind of charge that Nancy is going to have, is identifying where are areas where we can make big change that lasts beyond the economic recovery plan and we'll save taxpayer money over the long term.\nOK? Thank you, everybody.\nQ: Sir, what about Roland Burris? Would you like to see him seated in your seat, Roland Burirs?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: That is a Senate matter, but I know Roland Burris. Obviously, he is from my home state. I think he's a fine public servant. If he gets seated then I'm going to work with Roland Burris just like I work with all of the other senators, to make sure that the people of Illinois and the people of the country are served.\nAll right? thank you, guys.", "timestamp": "2009-01-07", "title": "Remarks Announcing the Appointment of Nancy Killefer as Chief Performance Officer"}

The transition, I think, has been as smooth as any we've seen in history partly because President Bush and Josh Bolten and his team have worked very closely with ours. And all of the former presidents as well as current President Bush, I think have a unique understanding of what the pressures and possibilities of that office. And so they gave me good counsel, not just on specific issues, but more importantly, some of the typical problems that you may end up confronting in the office. How do you make sure that you get good information? How do you make sure that people aren't just telling you what you want to hear? How do you make sure that people are thinking as a team instead of promoting their own individual agendas. And so I found it very helpful.

So the--and I think everybody concurred on that one. I--you know, President Carter and Clinton both had some unique insights because they had younger children when they were in the White House.

Why not go to the $1.2 trillion that some economists have recommended? Is that because you think that the political figure of a trillion dollars is too politically charged to get over? Is it because you think more spending would be pork rather than stimulus? Or do you think you've figured out exactly the right amount of stimulus that's needed?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all I think it's important to note that every economist, conservative or liberal, at this point agrees that we have to have a substantial recovery plan that helps to jump-start the economy, that short term it's going to be expensive, but it would be much more expensive to see the economy continue in the tailspin that it's been going in. We've seen ranges from 800 to 1.3 trillion and our attitude was that given the legislative process, if we start towards the low end of that, we'll see how it develops. We are concerned...\nHARWOOD: It's going to get bigger.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, we don't know yet. But what we are concerned about is making sure that the money is spent wisely, that there's oversight, that there's transparency. We are going to use this money to temporarily boost the economy, to create or save three million jobs, but also to put some down payments on things that we should've been doing over the last several decades that can help create a more competitive US economy. Examples: making sure that we are doubling alternative energy, and creating much more efficiency in our buildings and in our transportation systems, making sure that we are reducing the cost of health care using health information technologies, building up world class schools so that our children are benefiting and can compete in the global economy. So what we want to do is make sure that any money we're spending is, number one, creating jobs, stabilizing the economy, but also is being used prudently so that when we come out of the current stretch that we're in, we're going to see a stronger economy, a better economy, a more efficient economy.\nHARWOOD: A lot of parallels have been offered between yourself and John F. Kennedy, who also made history, came in with a young, attractive family, had a lot of big Harvard brains around him as he began his administration.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: We learned during the 1960s that the best and the brightest don't always have it figured out right.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You've got to watch out for those Harvard guys. They'll get you every time.\nHARWOOD: How confident are you that your plan is going to work, and how do you avoid the dangers of being too cocky?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I think that the approach that we've taken is not just to talk to the usual suspects, but talk to people that traditionally don't agree with me. And when you've got Ronald Reagan's former economic advisers or John McCain's former economic advisers or George Bush's former economic advisers giving you similar advice to what advisers to Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter are giving you, then you have a sense that, across the political spectrum, there's some consensus.\nNow, it's not going to happen over night. This is a tough situation and you know, no matter what we do on reinvestment and recovery, we're still going to have to do some other things to make sure the economy is in much better shape. One of the central things that we're going to have to do is reform how our financial systems work. We've got to get credit flowing again. That means restoring trust, restoring openness in the system. It means that our regulatory frameworks have to be fundamentally reformed, and that's going to be a major package that I unveil over the next several weeks and months. It means that we've got to deal much more seriously with the housing crisis that's taking place and stabilize that. It means that we're going to have to think about how we are approaching fiscal responsibility. And that's why today I announced a chief performance officer that will follow through on my commitment in the campaign to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page and determine which programs are working and what programs aren't, and eliminate programs that aren't working and make the programs that we have work better.\nSo this is going to be a multipronged attack against the enormous slump that we're seeing right now. And the long-term goal is making sure that we're saving and protecting jobs, that businesses and American families are able to benefit from the flow of credit again. I'm not out to increase the size of the government long-term. My preference would be that the private sector was doing this all on their own. But I think the consensus across the board from people, even who didn't vote on it is that we have to take some bold steps now to make sure that we prevent the worst from occurring.\nHARWOOD: Any concern about overconfidence?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: No, I am enormously humbled by the challenges ahead of us. What I do have confidence about is that I'm a good listener, I'm good at synthesizing advice from a range of different perspectives, and that we will make the best possible decisions from the perspective of what's good for ordinary Americans.\nHARWOOD: President Bush faced questions for several years about his exit strategy from Iraq. Same question for your financial multifront attack as you mentioned.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: What's the exit strategy from autos, from insurance, from the financial sector?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: And how do you decide when it's time to stop focusing on the short-term, that your program's done all the good it can do...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: ...and it's time to start focusing on the long-term fiscal responsibility?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, we're not going to do it sequentially, we're going to do it on a parallel track. So I will be preparing a budget that is presented to Congress in February, and that budget will add medium-term and long-term projections as well as short-term projections.\nHARWOOD: So there is...(unintelligible)...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yes.\nHARWOOD: ...to when you care most about the deficit.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yes. Absolutely. But my point being we're not just going to wait until two years from now and then we'll start worrying about what to do about the deficit. We want to see all the things that we can do now under my watch to start bending the curve towards a lower deficit. But I think that my basic principle is that when you start seeing the private sector lending again, when credit is flowing to families and businesses, they can get auto loans, they can support their mortgage, that the job market has stabilized, then we will want to pull back. And that's why it's going to be important for us to monitor progress carefully. But understand that the best estimates we're getting right now is, even with the massive effort that we're going to make, we are still looking at the prospect of unemployment at a fairly high level. It just won't be the double digit levels that we might see if we took no action whatsoever. And it may take most of next year before we start seeing the economy going again in the ways that it should.\nHARWOOD: Will we be growing in the second half of 2009?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, yeah, I don't have a crystal ball. But I--here's what I'm confident about. If we do nothing, things will get much, much worse. With the plan that we have, we will do better than we would otherwise have done. And I do feel confident that we can create or save three million jobs. We've already lost at least two. We're going to get a jobs report at the end of this week which probably will indicate we've lost at least another half million jobs. And, you know, if we start seeing three, four, five million additional jobs lost next year, that's going to be a crisis that we haven't seen in a very long time, and we've got to nip that in the bud.\nHARWOOD: The issue of taxes. When we spoke in June, you said you might be willing to defer some tax increases that you've proposed in response to economic conditions.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: We know you've got $300 billion, roughly, of tax cuts...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: ...in your economic program, but are you prepared to say now that you're not going to seek the accelerated repeal of President Bush's tax cuts for people making over $250,000 and let them expire in 2010?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You're know, I'm not prepared to make a hard and fast commitment here with you today, John, but what I've said is that I'm less concerned about whether it happens this year or next year. More concerned with the basic principle that we've got to restore balance and fairness to the tax system. And that's why we've put forward as part of this package targeted tax cuts. Ninety-five percent of working families would get a tax break. We want to figure out other ways that we can get that money into people's pockets faster without having to wait until they file next year because otherwise it won't have the kind of stimulative effect that it needs. But we also want to make sure that we're keeping an eye on the deficit. And for people like you and me who are making more than 200, $250,000 a year, we believe that the Bush tax cuts were unnecessary, we think--we still think they're unnecessary, and we're going to make sure that that's not part of our tax code long term.\nHARWOOD: I don't know what hard and fast means, but it sounds like you're not going to seek the accelerated repeal this year.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Haven't made a final decision on it. That's going to be part of our consultations with Congress.\nHARWOOD: Let me ask you about bipartisanship.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Mm-hmm.\nHARWOOD: There seems to be a, at least for the moment, some level of dialogue that is different than we've seen between the two parties. How important to you is bipartisanship as an end in itself, meaning that will you be willing to accept ideas from the other side, even if you don't think they're as good as the ideas they might displace...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: ...for the sake of getting a broader consensus and not just passing a package with three or four Republicans supporting it?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Sure. Well, but, well, here's how I think about it. What's most important is what gets the job done. That's the lens to which I look at this. Is it creating three million jobs or saving three million jobs? Are we preparing, laying the groundwork for energy independence or reducing our health care costs, which is going to be critical to dealing with our deficit long term? Are we creating a first class education system? So that's my number one priority. Now, I don't think the Democratic Party has a monopoly on good ideas. I think the Republicans have a lot to offer. And what I will do is to listen and learn from my Republican colleagues. And anytime they can make a case that this is something that will be good for the American people, just because Democrats didn't think of it and Republicans are promoting it, that's not a good reason not to do it.\nThere are going to be some times, though, where we disagree. And if somebody presents to me a plan that they are ideologically wedded to but they can't persuade me that this is actually going to be good for the economy, then we're not going to do it. And there are going to be some times where we've got some fights. But what--my general point is I'm not looking for a fight, and I am looking for as much cooperation as possible, and I'm open to any ideas that are going to be presented.\nHARWOOD: Do you expect that the tax cut portion of your plan is going to grow in consultation with Republicans in Congress as you try to build more support for your plan?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, the attitude that I'm going to apply to the tax cuts is the same one that I apply to the investment package. And that is, is this money well spent. This is taxpayer money, it is going to be adding to the deficit short term. And if we can't justify it, then we're not going to spend tens or hundreds of billions of dollars just to make somebody happy if it's not good for the economy. And I'm going to apply that same rule across the board.\nHARWOOD: It's widely agreed that housing is at the root of the economic problem that we're facing right now.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: Your team has indicated that Sheila Bair will remain at the FDIC. What do you intend to propose beyond the plan that she's proposed to try to mitigate foreclosures, and when will you propose it, and do you think the most important priority is to spur home buying again, perhaps through tax credits, or to limit foreclosures?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, I do think that the FDIC and Sheila Bair have had the sense of urgency about the problem that I want to see. And so, you know, we haven't made any official statements on this yet, but I think generally they've been on the case with the resources that they have to try to shore up the system. I think that when it comes to the housing market, the Federal Reserve Board has done what it can to lower rates about as low as they can go. And so we've seen some activity around refinancing. That doesn't really solve the problem, though, of declining home values.\nAnd I think the most important thing when it comes to declining home values is number one, preventing further foreclosures. That just erodes home values across the board. And that's why I think for those of us who are still paying a mortage--you know, you hear sometimes folks up in the country say, \"Well, I've been responsible. Why should I provide any help to somebody who maybe took out a mortgage that they couldn't afford.\" Well, this goes back to the adage that if your neighbor's house is burning, you got to first worry about putting out the house, even if they'd acted irresponsibly. I think that's true when it comes to foreclosures as well. We've got to prevent the continuing deterioration of the housing market. That starts with foreclosures. That doesn't mean that we can't also provide some assistance. It may not all be in the form of mortgage assistance. One of the things that we think is very important in our reinvestment plan is to provide incentives to weatherize homes all across the country. That is the kind of long-term investment that can drastically cut the country's energy bills, increase energy independence, reduce global greenhouse gases. So, you know, there are some areas where we can make progress and provide relief and help to home owners. But dealing with this foreclosure crisis is something that we've got to do. I expect to unveil plans to prevent foreclosures in consultation with Barney Frank and Chris Dodd, who've done some very good work on this, sometime in the next month or two.\nHARWOOD: As part of the next part of the financial bailout package? President-elect OBAMA: As part of our multipronged attack to deal with the crisis.\nHARWOOD: There's been a lot of speculation that Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary who's heading your national economic council, will be selected by you to replace Ben Bernanke as the Fed chairman when Bernanke's term expires in 2010. Is that your intention or are you willing to say that you will reappoint Ben Bernanke?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Larry Summers doesn't even have this job yet. We--I've assigned him to it but we're not in our administration. I think it is premature for me to speculate on jobs coming up two years from now when I haven't gotten my current team in place.\nHARWOOD: Let me ask you about regulation. We're sitting in a building that once housed the SEC.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: How extensive an overhaul of the financial regulatory apparatus will you propose and support? When will you do that? And do you think there is a global regulatory apparatus that needs to be created? You've got the G-20 coming up in April in London.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right. Well, by the time that G-20 meeting takes place, we, I believe, will have presented our approach to financial regulation. I think some international coordination has to be done. But right now, we just have to take care...(unintelligible)...and Wall Street has not worked, our regulatory system has not worked the way it's supposed to. So it's going to be a substantial overhaul. We're going to have better enforcement, better oversight, better disclosure, increased transparency. We're going to have to look at this alphabet soup of agencies and figure out how do we get them to work together more effectively. We've got to stop splintering functions in such a way that capital in one form is treated one way and capital in another form is treated another way, because these days in global financial markets, they're all fungible. And there's systemic risks that are possible, whether it's in the form of dirivatives or insurance or traditional bank deposits. So we've got to update the whole system to meet the needs of the 21st century. This is an assignment that my team is already beginning to work on and I think that we will have, fairly shortly, a package that we've worked alongside Barney Frank and Chris Dodd, to present to the American people.\nHARWOOD: You've also drawn comparisons, or the challenge facing you has drawn comparisons with Franklin Roosevelt...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: ...since this is the worst financial crisis since the Depression. When he delivered his inaugurual speech, he told the American people, \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\"\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: When you deliver your speech on January 20th, do you see yourself as having the same task of reassurance for the American people? And how do you balance that with the need to convey the urgency of doing so?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well...(unintelligible)...if you look--as you might imagine, I've been ready inaugural speeches lately, and if you look at FDR's first speech, the line that's remembered is \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" But actually the bulk of the speech centered around the need to act and act now. And he explained, I think, the nature of the crisis, both in his inaugural speech and subsequent fireside chats, as well as anybody. This is a bit of advice that I received from one of the former presidents. He said, \"Part of the reason, Barack, that you're doing well right now is because you don't talk down to the American people, you play it straight and just explain what it is that's taking place.\" And I think that--I have such confidence in the American people. If you just play it straight with them, if you explain to them, here's our challenge, here's how we've gotten here and here's where I think we need to go, then I have enormous confidence that the American people will rise up to the challenge. So my job, both in the inauguration speech and in the months to come, is simply to explain as honestly and truthfully as possible what the circumstances are, what the best ideas are that are out there in terms of meeting those challenges, and if I do that, I feel confident that we'll come together to solve these problems.\nHARWOOD: There's an awful lot of noise in contemporary American culture. Argumentation on the left on right, on TV all the time. In the financial system as well. When you'd give your economic speech tomorrow, on CNBC we'll be running call with all the market indexes as you're talking showing whether the markets are going up or down.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nHARWOOD: How will you absorb that information? Is it important to you or is it important for you to tune that out and decide from the beginning that it's unimportant?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, look. I think it's important not to live in the bubble. So you've got to be open to outside information, particularly criticism. I'll tell you, I very rarely read good press and I often read bad press, not because I agree with it but because I want to get a sense of are there areas where I'm falling short and I can do better.\nHARWOOD: You haven't gotten a lot of bad press so far.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I'm sure it's coming. The--but the markets are obviously a slightly different situation. Right now, given the sensitivities of the market, I've got to pay some attention to market psychology because part of what we have right now is such a loss of trust in both the marketplace and in government that restoring that confidence, restoring that trust is going to be very important. I'm not going to part of watching the crawl at the bottom of an interview. What I will be doing is making sure that I'm communicating with key market participants on a regular basis, again, to explain to them what exactly our plans are and to solicit from them good ideas.\nAnd overall, though, one thing I'm pretty clear about is that as president, I've got to be looking out at the horizon. I can't be looking at today's headlines, because if I do, then I'm probably not going to make decisions based on what's best for the country. I'm going to be spending a lot of time worrying about day-to-day politics, and that's something that I've been trying to block out.\nHARWOOD: Speaking of trying to avoid the dangers of the bubble, you still got one of these in your pocket?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, I actually took it out as a consequence of this interview, but I'm still clinging to my BlackBerry. They're going to pry it out of my hands.\nHARWOOD: Well, are you, in fact, going to overcome this idea as anachronistic that presidents can't use the most modern...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, here's what I think I can get. I think I'm going to be able to get access to a computer somewhere. It may not be right in the Oval Office. The second thing I'm hoping to do is to see if there's someway that we can arrange for me to continue to have access to a BlackBerry. I know that...\nHARWOOD: As of this moment, you still have your BlackBerry.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: As of this moment, I still do. This is a concern, I should add, not just of Secret Service, but also lawyers. You know, this town's full of lawyers. I don't know if you've noticed...\nHARWOOD: Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: ...and they have a lot of opinions. And so I'm still in a scuffle around that, but it--look, it's the hardest thing about being president.\nHARWOOD: Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: How do you stay in touch with the flow of everyday life? You know, when we were on vacation in Hawaii, I was greatly discouraged from going body surfing. Going to get shave ice was a major ordeal. And you know...\nHARWOOD: Well, were you told not to walk outside without your shirt on?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, the--I learned of that after the first day. But I think that...\nHARWOOD: Was that--was that an embarrassment to you? Or do you care? You got a lot of commentary about that.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, it was--it was silly, but, you know, silliness goes with this job.\nHARWOOD: You got some flattery for that.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, you know, the--my wife was tickled by me blushing. Anyway, what point was I making here, John? We got sidetracked by the...\nHARWOOD: You were saying that it looks like you're going to maybe tussle to keep your BlackBerry.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I don't know that I'll win, but I'm still--I'm still fighting it. And--but here's the point I was making, I guess, is that it's not just the flow of information. I mean, I can get somebody to print out clips for me, and I can read newspapers. What it has to do with is having mechanisms where you are interacting with people who are outside of the White House in a meaningful way. And I've got to look for every opportunity to do that--ways that aren't scripted, ways that aren't controlled, ways where, you know, people aren't just complimenting you or standing up when you enter into a room, ways of staying grounded. And if I can manage that over the next four years, I think that will help me serve the American people better because I'm going to be hearing their voices. They're not going to be muffled as a consequence of me being in the White House.\nHARWOOD: A couple of things quickly before we go. Dick Parsons going to be your next commerce secretary?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I have not made a final determination on who my next Commerce secretary is. When I know, I will let you know, John.\nHARWOOD: Is he a candidate?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I have not--I am not going to make comments at all. Dick Parsons is a great guy, though, a good friend of mine.\nHARWOOD: Are you confident that you've gotten over this brief period of controversy over the choice of Leon Panetta to head the CIA? And how much difficulty do you anticipate trying to codify your commitment to end the notion that the United States tolerates torture?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, I have not made an official announcement about Leon Panetta. When I do, I'll have something more to say about it. I can say that Leon Panetta is an outstanding public servant with impeccable integrity, somebody who's worked on national security at the highest levels and if I were to select him, I think he would do an outstanding job. There is a broader question and that is how do we rebrand, reset our intelligence operations? There are some extraordinary people who have done great work in the CIA, in our Department of National Intelligence, and I want them to get all the tools that they need in order to perform effectively. And I also want to make sure that all of those folks who are working so hard to provide the best intelligence to our national security apparatus, that they're not operating under a cloud in which policies are made, they are put in the cross-fire, and they end up bearing the blame as a consequence of us maybe not living up to our highest values and ideals.\nHARWOOD: Do you expect it to be difficult and complicated to affect that change?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yeah.\nHARWOOD: I think some things should define what exactly is and isn't torture?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, let me give you an example. I think that there's some things that shouldn't be difficult. I'm saying that we abide by the Geneva Convention. That shouldn't be difficult. We helped design the Geneva Convention. We pushed it through, and it has served us well. I think that Guantanamo, I'm going to close. How we do that is not simple because we have people who have been detained there, many of them who actually may be dangerous. We should have tried them in the first place, but now, because of the circumstances that have existed over the last several years, it's more difficult because some of the evidence against them might be tainted in terms of how it was obtained. So we've got to do very careful reviews of how we do that. But my broad commitment: No torture, that we abide by rule of law, that we abide by our constitution, that we live up to the Geneva Conventions. Those things are designed not just to feel good about ourselves, they're designed to make sure that we continue to communicate that we have the moral high ground, that America lives up to our standard. That is going to benefit us over the long-term and make us safer.\nHARWOOD: Last question. Florida plays Oklahoma tomorrow in the, what's widely regarded as the national championship game. You've talked about the need for a college football playoff. Do you think Utah, which finished undefeated by defeating Alabama, has a good a claim as either of those schools to be the national champion?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think Utah has a pretty good claim. They're undefeated. And Florida and Oklahoma both are well...(unintelligible). I think USC, which had a great Rose Bowl, beat Penn State pretty badly. They've got a pretty good claim to being number one. Florida and Oklahoma, I think, both have a claim. Texas, at this point, has got to feel like, \"Well, we did OK, too.\" I think--I think a football playoff system makes sense. I've spoken about this quite a bit, and I think if you look at knowledgeable sports fans, they agree with me. But, you know, I've got to pick and choose my battles. I probably am going to be spending more time focusing on creating three more--three million more jobs.\nHARWOOD: Thanks so much for joining us.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I had a great time, John, thank you.", "timestamp": "2009-01-07", "title": "Interview with John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85388", "text": "THE PRESIDENT-ELECT: When the American people spoke last November, they were demanding change, change in policies that helped deliver the worst economic crisis that we've seen since the Great Depression, but they're also looking for a change in the way that Washington does business. They were demanding that we restore a sense of responsibility and prudence to how we'd run our government.\nOne of the measures of irresponsibility that we've seen is the enormous federal debt that has accumulated, a number that has doubled in recent years. As we just discussed, my budget team filled me in on - Peter Orszag now forecasts that, at the current course and speed, a trillion-dollar deficit will be here before we even start the next budget, that we've already looked - we're already looking at a trillion-dollar budget deficit or close to a trillion-dollar budget deficit, and that potentially we've got trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, even with the economic recovery that we are working on at this point.\nSo the reason I raise this is that we're going to have to stop talking about budget reform. We're going to have to totally embrace it. It's an absolute necessity.\nAnd it has to begin with the economic recovery and reinvestment plan that Congress will soon be considering, that we're going to be investing an extraordinary amount of money to jump-start our economy, save or create 3 million new jobs, mostly in the private sector, and lay a solid foundation for future growth.\nBut we're not going to be able to expect the American people to support this critical effort unless we take extraordinary steps to ensure that the investments are made wisely and managed well. And that's why my recovery and reinvestment plan will have - will set a new higher standard of accountability, transparency, and oversight.\nWe are going to ban all earmarks, the process by which individual members insert pet projects without review. We will create an economic recovery oversight board made up of key administration officials and independent advisers to identify problems early and make sure we're doing all that we can to solve it. We will put information about where money is being spent online so that the American people know exactly where their precious tax dollars are going and whether we are hitting our marks.\nBut we're not going to be able to stop there. We're going to have to bring significant reform not just to our recovery and reinvestment plan, but to the overall budget process, to address both the deficit of dollars and the deficit of trust. We'll have to make tough choices, and we're going to have to break old habits. We're going to have to eliminate outmoded programs and make the ones that we do need work better.\nThat's the challenge that I've handed to Peter, and Rob Nabors, and the rest of my budget team. That's the challenge that the American people have handed me. They know that we're at a perilous crossroad and that tinkering in the margins will not do.\nI'm going to have more to say about this subject tomorrow, but today I wanted to lay out an early marker with those that I've entrusted to help bring the changes that the American people voted for. We are going to bring a long-overdue sense of responsibility and accountability to Washington. We are going to stop talking about government reform, and we're actually going to start executing.\nThat's the charge that I've given the members of the administration. That's the charge that was given to me by the American people. And we are ready for the challenge.\nSo with that, I'm going to take some questions. And let's start with you.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. Do you think that you'll be submitting a budget larger than the $3.1 trillion that President Bush submitted for fiscal '09? And, also, what are you doing to address concerns from other Democrats about deficit spending and increasing the deficit with the stimulus package?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, you know, I don't want to get into particular budget numbers, because we're obviously still in the process of reviewing what the existing budget looks like, where we can obtain some savings, what programs we can potentially eliminate. We will be submitting that budget later, after we've submitted the recovery and reinvestment plan.\nI can give you a set of general principles, though. We know that we're going to have to spend money to jump-start the economy. I spoke about that yesterday.\nWe know that even if we did nothing that we have close to a trillion-dollar deficit, even if we were on the current path that we're on. And we know that we have to then implement a set of fiscal measures that deal with the medium and long term so that we have a sustainable path of economic growth.\nSo what I've assigned Peter to do is - and Rob and others - is to work with my economic team. They are part of the team that is putting together the accountability and oversight measures into the recovery act, but they also have this broader charge, which is, how do we get a fix on this budget so that, as the economy recovers, we start stabilizing the economy and - and getting our budget under control?\nIt's not just Democrat or Republican colleagues on the Hill that are concerned about this. I'm concerned about this. And so what I've said is, I'm going to be willing to make some very difficult choices in how we get a handle on this deficit. That's what the American people are looking for.\nAnd, you know, what we intend to do this year, next year, and all the years that I'm in office is to demonstrate our seriousness, not by gimmicks, not by punting to future administrations the tough choices, but by making some of those tough choices while I'm in office.\nQ: ... Earmarks, you said there will be none that get in there without review. Some people would argue even the so-called bridge to nowhere got review, some level of review ...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: No, no, no. What I'm saying is - let me repeat what I said about that ... We will ban all earmarks in the recovery package. And I describe earmarks as the process by which individual members insert pet projects without review. So what I'm saying is, we're not having earmarks in the recovery package, period. I was describing what earmarks are.\nQ: So there's - you're not suggesting there's some level of review that might ...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'm saying there are no earmarks in the recovery package. That, that is the position that I'm taking.\nQ: Well, if I may, I was just wondering if $200,000 sounds like about the right level at which the tax credits would be phased out. I know that's been thrown out there ...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, look, I think you can get some guidance from what I said during the campaign, but I don't want to be locked in to a particular number, Chuck, just because we're still formulating the details of the plan. OK ...\nQ: Some are - some are questioning Leon Panetta's lack of intelligence - lack of experience on intelligence matters. Sorry about that. I know this is tricky for you since you haven't announced it yet, but what does he bring to the table for you?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, as you noted, I haven't made - haven't made a formal announcement about my intelligence team.\n[cell phone rings]\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: That may be him calling now... finding out where it's at.\nI have the utmost respect for Leon Panetta. I think that he is one of the finest public servants that we have. He brings extraordinary management skills, great political savvy, an impeccable record of integrity.\nAs chief of staff, he is somebody who - to the president - he's somebody who obviously was fully versed in international affairs, crisis management, and had to evaluate intelligence consistently on a day-to-day basis.\nHaving said all that, I have not made an announcement. When we make the announcement, I think what people will see is, is that we are putting together a top-notch intelligence team that is not only going to assure that I get the best possible intelligence unvarnished, that the intelligence community is no longer geared towards telling the president what they think the president wants to hear, but instead are going to be delivering the information that the president needs to make critical decisions to keep the American people safe.\nI think what you're also going to see is a team that is committed to breaking with some of the past practices and concerns that have, I think, tarnished the image of the agencies, the intelligence agencies, as well as U.S. foreign policy.\nLast point I will make, though, on this is that there are outstanding intelligence professionals in the CIA, in DNI, and others, and I have the utmost regard for the work that they've done, and we are committed to making sure that this is a team effort that's not looking backwards, but is looking forward to figure out how we're going to serve the American people best, OK?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. You're being put under a lot of pressure internationally to get more involved in the situation in Gaza. I understand you think there should only be one president at a time, but what do you have to say to the Israelis and the Palestinians who are fighting and dying in Gaza?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: As I've said before, when it comes to foreign policy, I think the need to adhere to one president at a time is particularly important. In domestic policy, Democrats, Republicans, we can have arguments back and forth about what tax policies are going to be. When it comes to international affairs, other countries are looking to see who speaks for America. Right now, President George Bush, as president of the United States, speaks on behalf of the U.S. government and the American people when it comes to international affairs.\nObviously, I am deeply concerned about the conflict that's taking place there. I'm being fully briefed and monitored - monitoring the situation on a day-to-day basis. The loss of civilian life in Gaza and in Israel is a source of deep concern for me.\nAnd after January 20th, I am going to have plenty to say about the issue. And I am not backing away at all from what I said during the campaign, that I - starting at the beginning of our administration, we are going to engage effectively and consistently in trying to resolve the conflicts that exist in the Middle East.\nThat's something that I'm committed to. I think it's not only right for the people in that region; most importantly, it's right for the national security of the American people and the stability that is so important to this country. So on January 20th, you will be hearing directly from me and my opinions on this issue. Until then, my job is to monitor the situation and put together the best possible national security team so that we hit the ground running once we are responsible for national security issues.", "timestamp": "2009-01-06", "title": "Informal Exchange with Reporters on the Economy and Budget"}

Good to see you.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Good morning. How are you?\nI guess this angle's better, huh? This must be, apparently.\nWell, let me just say how thrilled I am to be here sitting with the speaker. Obviously, the inauguration stand is being built in the background, but the reason we're here today is because the people's business can't wait.\nWe've got an extraordinary economic challenge ahead of us. We're expecting a sobering job report at the end of the week.\nThe speaker and her staff have been extraordinarily helpful in working with our team so that we can shape an economic recovery and reinvestment plan that starts putting people back to work. And, you know, I can't think of a better partner in doing what is necessary to get this economy back on track than Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has just been an extraordinary advocate for working people all her life.\nPELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect. It is a great honor and a personal privilege to welcome you to the speaker's office.\nTomorrow, we will swear in a new Congress. We'll be -- hit the ground running on the initiatives that -- some of which you described to address some of the pain being felt by the American people. And then two weeks from tomorrow, we will inaugurate a new president of the United States.\nAs the president-elect indicated, the construction is under way right now. And at that time, we will be able to have signed into law legislation which will improve the lives of the American people.\nIt's a very, very exciting time. We pledge to work together in a bipartisan way with great civility, with great fiscal discipline, and I know the debate will be spirited.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85370", "text": "Well, thanks for taking the time to come in for a moment.\nYou know, this is the core of my economic team, and the message of our meeting today is one that comes as no surprise to most Americans, and that is we are in a very difficult spot. The economy is bad. The situation is getting worse.\nLast week, we learned that manufacturing had hit a 20-year low. On Friday, we're going to get the final jobs report from this year, and every indication is that we will have lost in 2008 more jobs than at any time since World War II.\nIt's clear that we have to act and we have to act now to address this crisis and break the momentum of the recession or the next few years could be dramatically worse. That's the message that I delivered to Speaker Pelosi this morning. I will be meeting with Harry Reid and with the bipartisan leadership group this afternoon.\nAnd the most important message today is that the situation is getting worse, we've got to act boldly, and we've got to act swiftly. We cannot delay.\nI said in my Web address this past Saturday, this is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem at this stage. This is an American problem, and we're all going to have to chip in and do the hard work that's required and what the American people expect of us.\nOver the last few weeks, our economic crisis has only grown deeper. Two million Americans have now lost their jobs over the last year. We have a substantial number -- in fact, Christina Romer, our economist from the Council of Economic Advisers, indicates to me that in addition to the 2 million who've lost jobs, you've got 2.8 million who have moved from full-time work to part-time work.\nSo when you start counting in people who are underemployed, then the situation is very dire for American families.\nAgain, manufacturing's hit a 28-year low.\nAcross America, millions of Americans are struggling with rising costs, growing debts, concerns about home foreclosure, a deepening sense of unease.\nWhen I last met with my team, I asked them to continue their work on an American recovery and reinvestment plan that would not only create jobs in the short term, but also spur economic growth and lay the foundation for a sustained competitiveness in this global economy over the long term.\nDuring today's meeting, I learned about the substantial progress that they've made in developing that plan. And we are beginning to share details of that plan with leadership on the Hill. And we will be rolling this out to the American people, assuring that there is clarity and transparency about the entire process.\nOne of the things that I've emphasized to my team -- and one of the things that I've emphasized to congressional leadership and will emphasize again today -- is that not only do we have to act boldly, swiftly and with a sufficient magnitude to make a difference, but we've also got to do things in a new way.\nIt's not going to be sufficient for us just to fall back into the old Washington ways and simply throw money at the problem. We need to demand vigorous oversight; we need to have strict accountability in terms of how the -- the recovery and reinvestment plan operates.\nThe American people have a right to know how every dime of their money is spent, and that is going to be built into the plan, so that everybody understands what is being done in order to address this crisis.\nWe also in this group talked today about the financial system that is still precarious. We have not seen the credit markets recover the way we would have liked to see them recover, despite the efforts of Treasury and of the Fed, the many unprecedented steps that have been taken.\nAnd so part of this team's task is to shape the next phase of economic recovery so that it is more transparent, so that it is more consistent, so that the public and the markets and businesses all understand exactly how it is working, what our expectations are and what will be accomplished as a consequence of some of the extraordinary steps that have been taken.\nFinally, we talked today about the tough choices that we're going to have to make to restore fiscal responsibility, so as the economy recovers, our deficit can start to be brought down. As I said earlier, right now, the most important task for us is to stabilize the patient. The economy is badly damaged; it is very sick. And so we have to take whatever is -- steps are required to make sure that it is stabilized.\nBut we also have to recognize that if we're going to grow this economy over the long term, if we're going to create a better future for our children and our grandchildren, then we can't be fiscally irresponsible about how we do it.\nAnd so -- we have been in deep conversations and will continue over the next several weeks to shape our recovery and reinvestment package alongside very concrete, serious plans for midterm and long- term fiscal discipline. And that is something that we will be also be presenting to the American people as well as leadership on Capitol Hill.\nSo I'm looking forward to meeting with both the Democrats and Republicans this afternoon. My expectation is that they will share the same sense of urgency that I do, that we are going to move quickly, that we're not going to get bogged down in a lot of old-style politics on either side.\nThere's not going to be a lot of finger-pointing or posturing. The American people need action now. That's what I intend to provide as president of the United States. So with that, let me take a couple questions.\nQUESTION: How fast does this plan need to move to passage?\nAnd in moving swiftly and boldly, are you concerned at all about sacrificing transparency and a full examination of the process?\nAnd also, if you don't mind, could you also talk about the extent to which the tax cut part of this plan is political (OFF-MIKE) getting it passed?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, let take the second question first. Some of you, at least, were following the campaign. And for the last two years, I've talked about the need for middle-class tax cuts.\nSo the notion that me wanting to include relief for working families in this plan is somehow a political ploy, when this is -- was the centerpiece of my economic plan, for the last two years, doesn't make too much sense.\nWhat -- in a bad situation, there is a happy convergence between what I had pledged during the campaign and what's required for the economy, right now, to put more money into the pockets of ordinary Americans who are more insecure about their jobs, who are continuing to see rising costs in an area like health care, who are struggling to make ends meet.\nBut, you know, we think it is very important to have a balanced recovery and reinvestment package. Part of it is going to be addressing consumers and making sure they've got money in their pockets.\nPart of it is to provide incentives for businesses so that they start investing in plants and equipment that ultimately leads to jobs.\nPart of it is going to be investing in the kinds of job-creating growth industries of the future, whether it's health I.T., whether it's energy, that assure economic competitiveness over the long term.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: So I wouldn't separate any of these parts. They're all of a piece.\nAnd, as far as your first question, we are confident that we can accomplish unprecedented transparency, even as we move this package forward. Not only will Congress know exactly what's in this bill, but we're exploring steps, for example, like putting on a Web site very detailed information about all the projects that are taking place, what kind of impact we expect them to have, what kinds of job growth we hope to generate as a consequence of any of the discrete items that we are -- that we're putting forward.\nQUESTION: Good afternoon, sir. To what extent has the violence in the Middle East distracted your team on the economic plan? And is the deadline for your stimulus -- are you still hoping for -- has it slipped to February?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, as I said before, I strongly believe that a president or a president-elect or his team should be able to do more than one thing at a time. And so, obviously, international affairs are of deep concern.\nWith the situation in Gaza, I've been getting briefed every day. I've had consistent conversations with members of the current administration about what's taking place. That will continue.\nI will continue to insist that when it comes to foreign affairs, it is particularly important to adhere to the principle of one president at a time, because there are delicate negotiations taking place right now, and we can't have two voices coming out of the United States when you have so much at stake.\nWith respect to the timetable for the economic recovery and reinvestment plan, we are going to do most of this work this month.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: And, you know, we're not waiting. The reason I'm here today is that we are going to present our latest ideas to Congress. We expect them to begin this week on this process. And, you know, I expect to sign a bill to create 3 million jobs for the American people shortly after I get inaugurated.\nQUESTION: Sir, what do you mean by shortly after?\n[LAUGHTER]\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, look, there are only so many days in the legislative process, and it's going to take some time, even on an expedited schedule, to get a bill passed and on my desk. But we anticipate that by the end of January or the first week in February we have gotten the bulk of this done.", "timestamp": "2009-01-05", "title": "Remarks and an Exchange with Reporters Following a Meeting with Economic Advisors"}

Governor Richardson is an outstanding public servant and would have brought to the job of Commerce Secretary and our economic team great insights accumulated through an extraordinary career in federal and state office. It is a measure of his willingness to put the nation first that he has removed himself as a candidate for the Cabinet in order to avoid any delay in filling this important economic post at this critical time. Although we must move quickly to fill the void left by Governor Richardson's decision, I look forward to his future service to our country and in my administration.\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON\nFor nearly three decades, I have been honored to serve my state and our nation in Congress, at the U.N., as Secretary of Energy and as governor. So when the President-elect asked me to serve as Secretary of Commerce, I felt a duty to answer the call. I felt that duty particularly because America is facing such extraordinary economic challenges. The Department of Commerce must play an important role in solving them by helping to grow the new jobs and businesses America so badly needs. It is also because of that sense of urgency about the work of the Commerce Department that I have asked the President-elect not to move forward with my nomination at this time. I do so with great sorrow. But a pending investigation of a company that has done business with New Mexico state government promises to extend for several weeks or, perhaps, even months. Let me say unequivocally that I and my Administration have acted properly in all matters and that this investigation will bear out that fact. But I have concluded that the ongoing investigation also would have forced an untenable delay in the confirmation process. Given the gravity of the economic situation the nation is facing, I could not in good conscience ask the President-elect and his Administration to delay for one day the important work that needs to be done. So, for now, I will remain in the job I love, Governor of New Mexico, and will continue to work every day, with Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish, to make a positive difference in the lives of New Mexicans. I believe she will be a terrific governor in the future. I appreciate the confidence President-elect Obama has shown in me, and value our friendship and working partnership. I told him that I am eager to serve in the future in any way he deems useful. And like all Americans, I pray for his success and the success of our beloved country.", "timestamp": "2009-01-04", "title": "Statements of President-Elect Barack Obama and Governor Bill Richardson"}

But as we mark the beginning of a new year, we also know that America faces great and growing challenges—challenges that threaten our nation's economy and our dreams for the future.  Nearly two million Americans have lost their jobs this past year—and millions more are working harder in jobs that pay less and come with fewer benefits.  For too many families, this new year brings new unease and uncertainty as bills pile up, debts continue to mount and parents worry that their children won't have the same opportunities they had.\nHowever we got here, the problems we face today are not Democratic problems or Republican problems. The dreams of putting a child through college, or staying in your home, or retiring with dignity and security know no boundaries of party or ideology.\nThese are America's problems, and we must come together as Americans to meet them with the urgency this moment demands.  Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don't act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double digit unemployment and the American Dream slipping further and further out of reach.\nThat's why we need an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that not only creates jobs in the short-term but spurs economic growth and competitiveness in the long-term.  And this plan must be designed in a new way—we can't just fall into the old Washington habit of throwing money at the problem.  We must make strategic investments that will serve as a down payment on our long-term economic future. We must demand vigorous oversight and strict accountability for achieving results. And we must restore fiscal responsibility and make the tough choices so that as the economy recovers, the deficit starts to come down. That is how we will achieve the number one goal of my plan—which is to create three million new jobs, more than eighty percent of them in the private sector.\nTo put people back to work today and reduce our dependence on foreign oil tomorrow, we will double renewable energy production and renovate public buildings to make them more energy efficient.  To build a 21st century economy, we must engage contractors across the nation to create jobs rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, and schools.  To save not only jobs, but money and lives, we will update and computerize our health care system to cut red tape, prevent medical mistakes, and help reduce health care costs by billions of dollars each year. To make America, and our children, a success in this new global economy, we will build 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries. And to put more money into the pockets of hardworking families, we will provide direct tax relief to 95 percent of American workers.\nI look forward to meeting next week in Washington with leaders from both parties to discuss this plan.  I am optimistic that if we come together to seek solutions that advance not the interests of any party, or the agenda of any one group, but the aspirations of all Americans, then we will meet the challenges of our time just as previous generations have met the challenges of theirs.\nThere is no reason we can't do this.  We are a people of boundless industry and ingenuity.  We are innovators and entrepreneurs and have the most dedicated and productive workers in the world.  And we have always triumphed in moments of trial by drawing on that great American spirit—that perseverance, determination and unyielding commitment to opportunity on which our nation was founded.  And in this new year, let us resolve to do so once again.", "timestamp": "2009-01-03", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}

This week, Americans are gathering with family and friends across the country to celebrate the blessings of Christmas and the holiday season.\nAs we celebrate this joyous time of year, our thoughts turn to the brave men and women who serve our country far from home. Their extraordinary and selfless sacrifice is an inspiration to us all, and part of the unbroken line of heroism that has made our freedom and prosperity possible for over two centuries.\nMany troops are serving their second, third, or fourth tour of duty. And we are reminded that they are more than dedicated Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guard – they are devoted fathers and mothers; husbands and wives; sons and daughters; and sisters and brothers.\nThis holiday season, their families celebrate with a joy that is muted knowing that a loved one is absent, and sometimes in danger. In towns and cities across America, there is an empty seat at the dinner table; in distant bases and on ships at sea, our servicemen and women can only wonder at the look on their child's face as they open a gift back home.\nOur troops and military families have won the respect and gratitude of their broader American family. Michelle and I have them in our prayers this Christmas, and we must all continue to offer them our full support in the weeks and months to come.\nThese are also tough times for many Americans struggling in our sluggish economy. As we count the higher blessings of faith and family, we know that millions of Americans don't have a job. Many more are struggling to pay the bills or stay in their homes. From students to seniors, the future seems uncertain.\nThat is why this season of giving should also be a time to renew a sense of common purpose and shared citizenship. Now, more than ever, we must rededicate ourselves to the notion that we share a common destiny as Americans – that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper. Now, we must all do our part to serve one another; to seek new ideas and new innovation; and to start a new chapter for our great country.\nThat is the spirit that will guide my Administration in the New Year. If the American people come together and put their shoulder to the wheel of history, then I know that we can put our people back to work and point our country in a new direction. That is how we will see ourselves through this time of crisis, and reach the promise of a brighter day.\nAfter all, that is what Americans have always done.\n232 years ago, when America was newly born as a nation, George Washington and his Army faced impossible odds as they struggled to free themselves from the grip of an empire.\nIt was Christmas Day—December 25th, 1776 – that they fought through ice and cold to make an improbable crossing of the Delaware River. They caught the enemy off guard, won victories in Trenton and Princeton, and gave new momentum to a beleaguered Army and new hope to the cause of Independence.\nMany ages have passed since that first American Christmas. We have crossed many rivers as a people. But the lessons that have carried us through are the same lessons that we celebrate every Christmas season—the same lessons that guide us to this very day: that hope endures, and that a new birth of peace is always possible.", "timestamp": "2008-12-24", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85075", "text": "Over the past few weeks, Vice President-Elect Biden and I have announced some of the leaders who will advise us as we seek to meet America's twenty-first century challenges, from strengthening our security, to rebuilding our economy, to preserving our planet for our children and grandchildren. Today, I am pleased to announce members of my science and technology team whose work will be critical to these efforts.\nWhether it's the science to slow global warming; the technology to protect our troops and confront bioterror and weapons of mass destruction; the research to find life-saving cures; or the innovations to remake our industries and create twenty-first century jobs – today, more than ever before, science holds the key to our survival as a planet and our security and prosperity as a nation. It's time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and worked to restore America's place as the world leader in science and technology.\nRight now, in labs, classrooms and companies across America, our leading minds are hard at work chasing the next big idea, on the cusp of breakthroughs that could revolutionize our lives. But history tells us that they can't do it alone. From landing on the moon, to sequencing the human genome, to inventing the Internet, America has been the first to cross that new frontier because we had leaders who paved the way: leaders like President Kennedy, who inspired us to push the boundaries of the known world and achieve the impossible; leaders who not only invested in our scientists, but who respected the integrity of the scientific process.\nBecause the truth is that promoting science isn't just about providing resources – it's about protecting free and open inquiry. It's about ensuring that facts and evidence are never twisted or obscured by politics or ideology. It's about listening to what our scientists have to say, even when it's inconvenient – especially when it's inconvenient. Because the highest purpose of science is the search for knowledge, truth and a greater understanding of the world around us. That will be my goal as President of the United States – and I could not have a better team to guide me in this work.\nDr. John Holdren has agreed to serve as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. John is a professor and Director of the Program on Science, Technology, and Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, as well as President and Director of the Woods Hole Research Center. A physicist renowned for his work on climate and energy, he's received numerous honors and awards for his contributions and has been one of the most passionate and persistent voices of our time about the growing threat of climate change. I look forward to his wise counsel in the years ahead.\nJohn will also serve as a Co-Chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology – or PCAST – as will Dr. Harold Varmus and Dr. Eric Lander. Together, they will work to remake PCAST into a vigorous external advisory council that will shape my thinking on scientific aspects of my policy priorities.\nDr. Varmus is no stranger to this work. He is not just a path-breaking scientist, having won a Nobel Prize for his research on the causes of cancer – he also served as Director of the National Institutes of Health during the Clinton Administration. I am grateful he has answered the call to serve once again.\nDr. Eric Lander is the Founding Director of the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard and was one of the driving forces behind mapping the human genome – one of the greatest scientific achievements in history. I know he will be a powerful voice in my Administration as we seek to find the causes and cures of our most devastating diseases.\nFinally, Dr. Jane Lubchenco has accepted my nomination as the Administrator of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is devoted to conserving our marine and coastal resources and monitoring our weather. As an internationally known environmental scientist, ecologist and former President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Jane has advised the President and Congress on scientific matters, and I am confident she will provide passionate and dedicated leadership at NOAA.\nWorking with these leaders, we will seek to draw on the power of science to both meet our challenges across the globe and revitalize our economy here at home. And I'll be speaking more after the New Year about how my Administration will engage leaders in the technology community and harness technology and innovation to create jobs, enhance America's competitiveness and advance our national priorities.\nI am confident that if we recommit ourselves to discovery; if we support science education to create the next generation of scientists and engineers right here in America; if we have the vision to believe and invest in things unseen, then we can lead the world into a new future of peace and prosperity.\nThank you, and happy holidays everybody.", "timestamp": "2008-12-20", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85086", "text": "Good afternoon.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to say a few words about the necessary step taken today to help avoid a collapse in our auto industry that would have devastating consequences for our economy and our workers. With the short-term assistance provided by this package, the auto companies must bring all their stakeholders together – including labor, dealers, creditors and suppliers – to make the hard choices necessary to achieve long-term viability. The auto companies must not squander this chance to reform bad management practices and begin the long-term restructuring that is absolutely necessary to save this critical industry and the millions of American jobs that depend on it, while also creating the fuel-efficient cars of the future.\nWhenever I have been asked how I measure the strength of the American economy, my answer is simple: jobs and wages. I know we will be headed in the right direction again when we are creating jobs, instead of losing them, and when Americans are gaining ground in terms of their incomes, instead of treading water or falling behind. In recent weeks, I've announced members of my economic team who will help us make progress in these areas.\nToday, I'm announcing several other appointees who will play an integral role in our efforts to turn our economy around: Congresswoman Hilda Solis as Secretary of Labor; former Congressman Ray LaHood as Secretary of Transportation; Karen Mills as Administrator of the Small Business Administration; and Mayor Ron Kirk as United States Trade Representative. Together with the appointees I've already announced, these leaders will help craft a 21st Century Economic Recovery Plan, with the goal of creating two and a half million new jobs and strengthening our economy for the future.\nIf jobs and incomes are our yardsticks, then the success of the American worker is key to the success of the American economy. For the past eight years, the Department of Labor has not lived up to its role either as an advocate for hardworking families or as an arbiter of fairness in relations between labor and management. That will change when Hilda Solis is Secretary of Labor. Under her leadership, I am confident that the Department of Labor will once again stand up for working families.\nHilda has always been an advocate for everyday people. When she received an award several years ago, she said, \"Fighting for what is just is not always popular, but it is necessary.\" And that is exactly what she has done throughout her career, blazing new trails every step of the way. Whether it's creating green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced or expanding access to affordable health care or raising the minimum wage in California, Hilda has been a champion of our middle class. And I know that Hilda will show the same kind of leadership as Secretary of Labor that she showed in California and on the Education and Labor Committee by protecting workers' rights – from organizing to collective bargaining, from keeping our workplaces safe to making our unions strong.\nStanding up for our workers means putting them back to work and fueling economic growth. Our economy boomed in the 20th Century when President Eisenhower remade the American landscape by building the interstate highway system. Now we need to remake our transportation system for the 21st Century. Doing so will not only help us meet our energy challenge by building more efficient cars, buses, and subways or make Americans safer by rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges – it will create millions of new jobs in the process.\nFew understand our infrastructure challenge better than the outstanding public servant I am asking to lead the Department of Transportation – Ray LaHood. As a Congressman from Illinois, Ray served six years on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, leading efforts to modernize our aviation system by renewing our aging airports and ensuring that air traffic controllers were using cutting edge technology. Throughout his career, Ray has fought to improve mass transit and invest in our highways. But he has not only helped rebuild our landscape, he has helped beautify it by creating opportunities for bikers and runners to enjoy our great outdoors. When I began this appointment process, I said I was committed to finding the best person for the job, regardless of party. Ray's appointment reflects that bipartisan spirit – a spirit we need to reclaim in this country to make progress for the American people.\nTo strengthen our economy, we must also strengthen the small businesses that are its backbone. I can think of no one better to lead this effort as Administrator of the Small Business Administration than Karen Mills. With Karen at the helm, America's small businesses will have a partner in Washington, helping them create jobs and spur growth in communities across this country. A venture capitalist who invests in small businesses, Karen understands the challenges faced by both small business owners and the workers they employ. With a background in the private sector and experience helping Maine's governor promote growth across the state, I am confident that Karen will lead an SBA that will not only help small business owners realize their dreams, but help our nation rebuild our economy.\nWe also know that the success of American businesses, small and large, depends on their ability to sell their products across the globe. That is why we must engage in strong, robust trade and open doors for American products. In our global economy, we must compete and win if we are going to strengthen our middle class and forge bonds with other nations that can contribute to peace and stability around the world. But I also believe that any trade agreement we sign must be written not just with the interests of big corporations in mind, but with the interests of our whole nation and our workers at heart.\nRon Kirk understands this better than just about anyone. As Mayor of Dallas, Ron helped steer one of the world's largest economies. He has seen the promise of trade, but also its pitfalls. And he knows there is nothing inconsistent about standing up for free trade and standing up for American workers. During his tenure as Mayor, Ron brought different groups together to create jobs, invest in the community, and spur economic growth. As a leader, negotiator, and principled proponent of trade, Ron will help make sure that any agreements I sign as President protect the rights of all workers, promote the interests of all Americans, and preserve the planet we all share.\nWith these outstanding appointees, I have filled out our economic team, and done so at an earlier point than any President in history, because we face challenges unlike any we have faced in generations.\nDaunting as the challenges we are inheriting may be, I'm convinced that our team and the American people are prepared to meet them. It will take longer than any of us would like – years, and not months. It will get worse before it gets better. But it will get better – if we're willing to act boldly and swiftly. And that is what we will do when I am President of the United States.", "timestamp": "2008-12-19", "title": "Remarks in Chicago Announcing Nominations for the Departments of Labor, Transportation, United States Trade Representative, and Small Business Administration"}

Daunting as the challenges we are inheriting may be, I'm convinced that our team and the American people are prepared to meet them.\"\nThe announcements made today are below:\nUnited States Congresswoman Hilda Solis, Nominee for Secretary of Labor\nFirst elected in 2000, Congresswoman Hilda Solis is serving her fourth term in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 32nd Congressional District of California. Prior to her election to Congress, Solis served eight years in the California state legislature. As a California State Senator, she led the battle to increase the state's minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75 an hour in 1996. In August 2000, Solis became the first woman to receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for her pioneering work on environmental justice issues in California. In 2003, she became the first Latina appointed to the Committee on Energy and Commerce where she is the Vice Chair of the Environment and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee and a member of the Health and Telecommunications Subcommittees. She is also a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources. In March 2007, Solis was named a member of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. She is the Vice Chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and serves as a Senior Whip, as well as a Regional Whip for Southern California. She is also serving her third term as the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' Task Force on Health and the Environment. Solis is a lifetime resident of the San Gabriel Valley and currently resides in the city of El Monte with her husband Sam, a small business owner.\nFormer United States Congressman Ray LaHood, Nominee for Secretary of Transportation\nFormer Congressman Ray LaHood is retiring from the United States Congress after serving seven terms representing the 18th District of Illinois. LaHood served on the House Appropriations Committee. He started his career teaching junior high school students, and later served as the Chief Planner for the Bi-State Metropolitan Commission, Director of the Rock Island Youth Services Bureau, and as District Administrative Assistant for Congressman Tom Railsback. After serving in the Illinois State House of Representatives in 1982, LaHood worked for U.S. House Republican Leader Robert Michel as District Administrative Assistant and, for four years, as Chief of Staff. He succeeded Mr. Michel upon his retirement in January of 1995. In the United States Congress, LaHood served for six years on the Transportation Committee and has led efforts to enhance Illinois' infrastructure, working to secure funds to improve local highways, such as the reconstruction of Interstate 74 in Peoria, the expansion of U.S. Route 67, and the completion of Route 336. LaHood has been a proponent for improving local airports through securing funds for new construction and expansion, while also working with officials to increase air service. LaHood, a native of Peoria, Illinois, is married to his wife Kathy and they have four children.\nFormer Mayor Ron Kirk, Nominee for United States Trade Representative\nFormer Mayor Ron Kirk served as Mayor of the City of Dallas from 1995-2001, and in 1994, he served as the Texas Secretary of State. He is a former Dallas Assistant City Attorney for Governmental Relations and served as aide to United States Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Kirk has over 20 years of experience providing legislative counsel to numerous governmental and corporate entities. Kirk was named one of \"The 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America\" by The National Law Journal (2008), earned the Justinian Award from The Dallas Lawyers Auxiliary (2008), and was named one of The Best Lawyers in America in government relations law (2007-2009). Kirk earned his B.A. from Austin College in 1976 and his J.D. from the University of Texas School of law in 1979.\nKaren G. Mills, Administrator of the Small Business Administration\nKaren G. Mills has been a principal in the private equity and venture capital industry since 1983 and has taken a leadership role in the growth of more than 20 companies in the consumer products, food, distribution, textile and industrial component sectors. Mills was a co-founder and managing director of Solera Capital and Chief Operating Officer of E.S. Jacobs and Company. Mills chairs Governor Baldacci's Council on Competitiveness and the Economy and is deeply engaged in economic policy for the state of Maine. In 2006, she led the initiative for a $50 million competitive research and development bond which passed the legislature with strong bipartisan support, and was approved by public referendum. She also sits on the Governor's Council for the Redevelopment of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, which recently went on the BRAC closure list, and serves on the boards of the Maine Technology Institute and the Maine chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Mills authored a Brookings paper on economic development clusters, and those recommendations were introduced as legislation by Senators Collins and Clinton in June 2008. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and has been Vice Chairman of the Harvard Overseers.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85084", "text": "Over the past few weeks, I've announced key members of my economic team, who are now crafting a 21st Century Economic Recovery Plan that will create 2.5 million jobs. But as I said throughout the campaign, what will be just as important to our long-term economic stability is a 21st century regulatory framework to ensure that a crisis like this can never happen again.\nToday, I am pleased to announce two individuals who will be leading that effort – Mary Schapiro as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Gary Gensler as the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I'm also pleased to announce that Dan Tarullo will be bringing his years of expertise on regulatory and banking reform to the Federal Reserve Board as one of its new governors.\nIn the last few days, the alleged scandal at Madoff Investment Securities has reminded us yet again of how badly reform is needed when it comes to the rules and regulations that govern our markets. Charities that invested in Madoff could end up losing savings on which millions depend – a massive fraud that was made possible in part because the regulators who were assigned to oversee Wall Street dropped the ball. And if the financial crisis has taught us anything, it's that this failure of oversight and accountability doesn't just harm the individuals involved, it has the potential to devastate our entire economy. That's a failure we cannot afford.\nFinancial regulatory reform will be one of the top legislative priorities of my Administration, and as a symbol of how important I view this reform, I'm announcing these appointments months earlier than previous administrations have. These individuals will help put in place new, common-sense rules of the road that will protect investors, consumers, and our entire economy from fraud and manipulation by an irresponsible few. These rules will reward the industriousness and entrepreneurial spirit that's always been the engine of our prosperity, and crack down on the culture of greed and scheming that has led us to this day of reckoning. Instead of allowing interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales and CEOs run off with excessive golden parachutes, we'll ensure openness, accountability, and transparency in our markets so that people can trust the value of the financial product they're buying. And instead of appointing people with disdain for regulation, I will ensure that our regulatory agencies are led by individuals who are ready and willing to enforce the law.\nThese are precisely the reasons why I chose the outstanding public servants who are with me today. Mary Schapiro currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the largest regulator for all securities firms that do business with the United States. Before that, she served as an SEC commissioner, and as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nMary is known as a regulator who's both smart and tough – so much so that she's been criticized by the same industry insiders who we need to get tough on. For years, she's used her position to educate investors about market risks, warn seniors and employers about retirement scams, and call for increased regulation of mortgage brokers long before this housing crisis hit. I know that Mary will provide the new ideas, new reforms, and new spirit of accountability that the SEC desperately needs so that fraud like the Madoff scandal doesn't happen again.\nTo chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, I've chosen Gary Gensler, who brings a wealth of expertise from both the public and private sectors to this position. In addition to serving as Under Secretary of Treasury during the Clinton Administration and a Senior Advisor to the Senate Banking Committee, Gary also gained a deep knowledge of our financial institutions during his decade as a partner at Goldman Sachs. As the new chairman of a commission charged with regulating some of the unsound practices and excessive leverage that helped cause this crisis, I know he will restore sound judgment and strict oversight to our markets. Along with Mary, Treasury Secretary-designee Tim Geithner, and others, Gary will also serve as a key member of the team that will reform our outdated financial regulations.\nI am also announcing Dan Tarullo, one of my trusted economic advisors, as a new governor of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy function will continue to be critical in navigating us through these trying economic times. But, as many of you know, the Federal Reserve also serves a vital regulatory function. Dan will bring a lifetime of experience to the Fed in economic policy, and financial regulation. A professor of law at Georgetown, Dan previously served as a senior economic advisor in the Clinton Administration, where he coordinated international economic policy and served as President Clinton's personal representative to multiple G-8 summits. His academic and policy work on financial regulation has anticipated some of the problems we have observed, and he has generated important ideas for how we should move forward. I have no doubt that his knowledge, experience, and independence will make him a valuable addition to the Federal Reserve at this critical time.\nFor over two centuries, our market has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world, and rewarded the innovators and risk-takers who have made America a beacon of science, technology, and discovery. But the American economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle – that America prospers when all Americans can prosper. That principle is why we put in place common-sense rules of the road to regulate our market, and it's why we need to restore and renew those rules today – so that every American from Wall Street to Main Street can have the chance to prosper once more. I have great faith and confidence in the ability of the team I've announced to make this possible.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85082", "text": "Earlier this week, I announced key members of the team that will help us seek new forms of energy to build a new economy, to enhance our security, and to leave our children a planet that's safer and cleaner. Today, I am pleased to announce two other key advisors and members of this team – Governor Tom Vilsack as Secretary of Agriculture and Senator Ken Salazar as Secretary of the Interior. Together, they will serve as guardians of the American landscape on which the health of our economy and the well-being of our families so heavily depend.\nOne of the great blessings bestowed upon us as Americans is the bounty of our natural environment – from the mountains and parks where we go hiking to the rivers and streams where we go fishing to the forests and fields where the proud tradition of hunting is passed on through the generations. But our wide open spaces are not only a blessing to be enjoyed, they are the foundation of a brighter future. How we harness our natural resources – from the farmlands of Iowa to the springs of Colorado – will speak not only to our quality of life, but to our economic growth and our energy future.\nIt's time for a new kind of leadership in Washington that's committed to using our lands in a responsible way to benefit all our families. That means ensuring that even as we are promoting development where it makes sense, we are also fulfilling our obligation to protect our national treasures. It means ensuring that we are using our farmlands not only to strengthen our agricultural economy, but to grow advanced biofuels that will help make the United States energy independent. And it means ensuring that the policies being shaped at the Departments of Agriculture and Interior are designed to serve not big agribusiness or Washington influence-peddlers, but family farmers and the American people.\nThat is the kind of leadership embodied by Ken Salazar and Tom Vilsack. Ken will bring to the Department of the Interior an abiding commitment to this land we love. His family has farmed and ranched the same land in Colorado for five generations. As a Senator from the great state of Colorado, he has been a champion for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities – from building a clean energy economy to setting aside 250,000 acres of Rocky Mountain National Park as wilderness.\nBefore serving in the United States Senate, Ken was Attorney General in Colorado, where he worked on a number of land, water, and environmental issues. As a water lawyer for a decade, Ken was also chosen to lead Colorado's Department of Natural Resources. In that role, he promoted responsible water management, balanced use of our energy resources, and built one of the most successful land conservation efforts in the nation.\nFew are better equipped to meet the energy and natural resource challenges we face in the 21st century. Among the many responsibilities Ken will bear as our next Secretary of the Interior is helping ensure that we finally live up to the treaty obligations that are owed to the First Americans. We need more than just a government-to-government relationship; we need a nation-to-nation relationship. And Ken and I will work together to make sure that tribal nations have a voice in this administration.\nTo lead a Department of Agriculture that helps unlock the potential of a 21st century agricultural economy, I can think of no one better than Tom Vilsack. As Governor of one of our most abundant farm states, he led with vision, promoting biotech to strengthen our farmers and fostering an agricultural economy of the future that not only grows the food we eat, but the energy we use. Tom understands that the solution to our energy crisis will be found not in oil fields abroad but in our farm fields here at home. That is the kind of leader I want in my cabinet.\nAs our next Secretary of Agriculture, Tom will not only help ensure that rural America has a true partner in implementing the Farm Bill and pursuing agricultural research, but that Washington is looking out for everyone from the small family farms that are feeding our communities to the large farms that are feeding the world. When President Lincoln established the Department of Agriculture nearly a century and a half ago, he called it the \"people's department\" for it was meant to serve the interests of those who lived off the land. And I know it will be the people's department once more when Tom is at the helm.\nWith the appointments I announced earlier this week, and those I am announcing today, I am confident that we have the team we need to make the rural agenda America's agenda, to create millions of new green jobs, to free our nation from its dependence on oil, and to help preserve this planet for our children. In the end, that is not only our responsibility as Americans, it is our obligation as stewards of God's Earth.", "timestamp": "2008-12-17", "title": "Remarks Announcing Nominees for Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture and Interior"}

As a governor from a farm state, Vilsack has been vocal in his support for the farm bill and for renewable sources of energy. In 2003, Vilsack passed the Grow Iowa Values Fund through the state legislature, a $503 million appropriation designed to boost the Iowa economy by offering grants to corporations and initiatives pledged to create higher-income jobs. Before serving as Governor, Vilsack was mayor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, and was elected to the Iowa State Senate in 1992.

From 1999 to 2004, Salazar served as Colorado's Attorney General. He served as chairman of the Conference of Western Attorneys General. From 1987 to 1994, Salazar served in the Cabinet of Governor Roy Romer as chief legal counsel and executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. Salazar also practiced water and environmental law in the private sector for eleven years.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85072", "text": "Over the past few weeks, Vice President-elect Biden and I have announced key members of our economic team, and they are working as we speak to craft a recovery program that will save and create millions of jobs and grow our struggling economy.\nBut we know that in the long run, the path to jobs and growth begins in America's classrooms. So today, we're pleased to announce the leader of our education team, whose work will be critical to these efforts: our nominee for Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.\nIn the next few years, the decisions we make about how to educate our children will shape our future for generations to come. They will determine not just whether our children have the chance to fulfill their God-given potential, or whether our workers have the chance to build a better life for their families, but whether we, as a nation, will remain in the twenty-first century, the kind of global economic leader that we were in the twentieth. Because at a time when companies can plant jobs wherever there's an Internet connection, and two-thirds of all new jobs require a higher education or advanced training, if we want to out-compete the world tomorrow, we must out-educate the world today.\nYet, when our high school dropout rate is one of the highest in the industrialized world; when a third of all fourth graders can't do basic math; when more and more Americans are getting priced out of attending college - we are falling far short of that goal.\nFor years, we have talked our education problems to death in Washington, but failed to act, stuck in the same tired debates that have stymied our progress and left schools and parents to fend for themselves: Democrat versus Republican; vouchers versus the status quo; more money versus more reform - all along failing to acknowledge that both sides have good ideas and good intentions.\nWe cannot continue on like this. It is morally unacceptable for our children - and economically untenable for America. We need a new vision for a 21st century education system - one where we aren't just supporting existing schools, but spurring innovation; where we're not just investing more money, but demanding more reform; where parents take responsibility for their children's success; where we're recruiting, retaining, and rewarding an army of new teachers; where we hold our schools, teachers and government accountable for results; and where we expect all our children not only to graduate high school, but to graduate college and get a good paying job.\nThese are precisely the goals to which Arne Duncan has devoted his life - from his days back in college, tutoring children here in Chicago; to his work at the helm of a non-profit remaking schools on the South Side; to his time working for the Chicago Public Schools, where he became Chief Executive Officer of this city's school system.\nWhen it comes to school reform, Arne is the most hands-on of hands-on practitioners. For Arne, school reform isn't just a theory in a book - it's the cause of his life. And the results aren't just about test scores or statistics, but about whether our children are developing the skills they need to compete with any worker in the world for any job.\nWhen faced with tough decisions, Arne doesn't blink. He's not beholden to any one ideology - and he doesn't hesitate for one minute to do what needs to be done. He's worked tirelessly to improve teacher quality, increasing the number of master teachers who've completed a rigorous national certification process from 11 to just shy of 1,200, and rewarding school leaders and teachers for gains in student achievement. He's championed good charter schools - even when it was controversial. He's shut down failing schools and replaced their entire staffs - even when it was unpopular. Dodge Renaissance Academy is a perfect example - since this school was revamped and re-opened in 2003, the number of students meeting state standards has more than tripled.\nIn just seven years, he's boosted elementary test scores here in Chicago from 38 percent of students meeting the standards to 67 percent. The dropout rate has gone down every year he's been in charge. And on the ACT, the gains of Chicago students have been twice as big as those for students in the rest of the state.\nSo when Arne speaks to educators across America, it won't be from up in some ivory tower, but from the lessons he's learned during his years changing our schools from the bottom up.\nI remember a conversation we had about one of those lessons a while back. We were talking about how he'd managed to increase the number of kids taking and passing AP courses in Chicago over the last few years. And he told me that in the end, the kids weren't any smarter than they were three years ago; our expectations for them were just higher.\nWell, I think it's time we raised expectations for our kids all across this country and built schools that meet - and exceed - those expectations. As the husband and brother of educators, the Vice President-Elect and I know this won't be easy - we've seen how hard Jill and Maya work every day. And we know it's going to take all of us, working together. Because in the end, responsibility for our children's success doesn't start in Washington. It starts in our homes and our families. No education policy can replace a parent who makes sure a child gets to school on time, or helps with homework and attends those parent-teacher conferences. No government program can turn off the TV, or put away the video games and read to a child at night.\nWe all need to be part of the solution. We all have a stake in the future of our children.\nI'll never forget my first visit to this school several years ago, when one of the teachers here told me about what she called the \"These Kids Syndrome\" - our willingness to find a million excuses for why \"these kids\" can't learn - how \"these kids\" come from tough neighborhoods, or \"these kids\" have fallen too far behind.\n\"When I hear that term, it drives me nuts,\" she told me. \"They're not 'these kids,' they're our kids.\"\nI can't think of a better way to sum up Arne's approach to education reform. With his leadership, I am confident that together, we will bring our education system - and our economy - into the 21st century, and give all our kids the chance to succeed.\nThank you.\n[APPLAUSE]\nDUNCAN: Thank you so much, Vice President-elect and President-elect Obama.\nI'm deeply, deeply honored to be asked to serve in your administration. Like so many Americans, I was inspired by your campaign. I'm even more inspired by the team of people you are building to help bring much needed change to our country.\nWhile many issues will demand your attention, I am convinced that no issue -- no issue is more pressing than education. Whether it's fighting poverty, strengthening our economy, or promoting opportunity, education is the common thread. It is the civil rights issue of our generation, and it is the one sure path to more equal, fair and just society.\nEducation has been my life's work. Starting on the South Side of Chicago where I grew up along with my sister and brother as a part of my mother's inner city after-school tutoring program. Her remarkable courage and dedication has been a constant source of inspiration to me.\nIt continued throughout high school, college, and much of my professional life, including Australia where I worked with under- privileged young people when I wasn't playing basketball. I am grateful that you have recognized all the hard work our team here in Chicago has done to turn around struggling schools, and create new learning options and opportunities across this city.\nI absolutely did not do this alone. And I am confident that the progress will continue. We are on a winning streak here, and have proven it twice the rate of the state on elementary test scores and at twice the rate of the state on the ACT test. Those trends must continue.\nI'm also eager to apply some of the lessons we've learned here in Chicago to help school districts all across our country.\nWe have worked with a the tremendous sense of urgency because we can't wait. Our children have just one chance to get a quality education, and they need and deserve the absolute best.\nWhile there are no simple answers, I know from experience that when you focus on basics like reading and math, and when you embrace innovative new approaches and when you create a professional climate to attract great teachers, you can create great schools.\nWe are producing more nationally board certified teachers than any other big city school system in the country. And in this work, talent matters tremendously. We must continue to attract and support the best and brightest teachers who are committed to making a difference in the lives of our children.\nI just want to take a moment to thank a few people who made it possible for me to be here today, starting with Mayor Daley. He had the confidence in me seven years ago when he asked me to take my current job, and he has always supported me when we made tough decisions, like the one to close and reopen this school right here.\nI want to thank our mutual friend John Rogers, who's been a mentor and friend to me since I was 10-years-old. He gave my sister and I the opportunity to start a great school in the South Side of Chicago, and that has become a model for success in urban education.\nI want to thank my children, Claire (ph) and Ryan (ph), and my wife Karen for all the tremendous support she's provided me during this job. And I want to thank her in advance for what I expect to be an even more demanding job in the years ahead.\nAnd, finally, I want to thank all the people of Chicago who helped make us a national model for reform, starting with my partner, Bob Resin Watkins (ph) and our board president, Rufus Williams.\nI know how important teamwork is, and it takes a lot of teamwork just to (INAUDIBLE) an education. I am deeply, deeply grateful to be a part of the Obama team. And together we have a chance to do something extraordinary for our nation's children.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Excellent. (APPLAUSE)\nOK.\n[APPLAUSE]\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I just wanted to dispel one rumor before I take questions. I did not select Arne because he's one of the best basketball players I know.\n[LAUGHTER]\nAlthough I will say that I think we are putting together the best basketball-playing Cabinet in American history.\n[LAUGHTER]\nAnd I think that is -- that is worth noting.\nI'm going to take a few questions.\nQ: (OFF-MIKE) mentioned the ties between education and the economy, and that's where I'd like to take us.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Sure.\nQ: The Federal Reserve is expected to lower the fed funds rate today to 50 basis points, one of the lowest rates in history.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nQ: I'm just wondering, how confident are you in Ben Bernanke's decision? And with that decision, are we running out of options to jump start the economy?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I don't think it's good policy for the president or a president-elect to second-guess the Fed, which is an independent body. But let me just make an observation that we are running out of the traditional ammunition that's used in a recession, which is to lower interest rates. They're getting to be about as low as they can go. And although the Fed is still going to have more tools available to it, it is critical that the other branches of government step up. And that's why the economic recovery plan is so absolutely critical.\nAnd my economic team, which I'm going to be meeting with today, is helping to shape what is going to be a bold agenda to create 2.5 million new jobs, to start helping states and local governments with shovel-ready projects -- rebuilding our roads, our bridges, making sure that schools like this one are energy efficient, putting people back to work, getting businesses to start seeing some increase in demand, so that we can get, instead of a downward spiral, start getting on an upward spiral.\nAnd I'm confident that we can accomplish that if we've got Democrats and Republicans, federal, state, and local governments all working together. But, look, we are going through the toughest time, economically, since the Great Depression. And it's going to be -- it's going to be tough.\nAnd we're going to have work through a lot of these difficulties, these structural difficulties that built up over many decades, some of it having to do with the financial industry and the huge amounts of leverage, the huge amounts of debt that were taken on, the speculation and the risk that was occurring, the lack of financial regulation; some of it having to do with our housing market, stabilizing that.\nIt's going to be, I think, critical for us to look at some of the long-term issues that I talked about during the campaign, health care and energy.\nAnd, finally, education is going to play a critical role in this. You know, what the Fed does or what our administration does, in terms of short-term, emergency action, is obviously going to be important to people's everyday lives.\nBut if we pursue the kind of strategy that Arne Duncan's pursued and I want to see our administration pursue, which is making no excuses and expecting high achievement from every child.\nIf we can get young people focused on education; if we can change our culture so that we are once again valuing intellectual achievement; and if we are willing to all pull together around making our schools better, that's going to be the single biggest determinant, in terms of how our economy does, long-term, OK? John McCormick (ph)?\nQ: (INAUDIBLE). First of all, given the situation here (INAUDIBLE) do you favor (INAUDIBLE) special election to fill your -- vacancy, and secondly, you told us at your first press conference after the election that you were going to take a very hands-off approach to filling that spot. Over the weekend, The Tribune reported that -- Rahm Emmanuel, your incoming chief of staff, had presented a list of potential names...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: John, let me -- let me -- let me just cut you out, because I don't want you to waste your question. As I indicated yesterday, we've done a full review of this. The -- the facts are going to be released next week. It would be inappropriate for me to comment, because the -- the -- for example, the -- the story that you just talked about in your own paper, I haven't confirmed that it was accurate, and I don't want to get into the details at this point. So do you have another question?\nQ: There's no conflict between what (INAUDIBLE) your hands-off approach and the possibility that (INAUDIBLE)...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: John -- John, I said -- The U.S. attorney's office specifically asked us not to release this until next week.\nQ: What about on a special election?\n(INAUDIBLE) given the (INAUDIBLE) chaos here in Illinois? (LAUGHTER)\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, I've said that I don't think the governor can serve effectively in his office. I'm going to let the state legislature make a determination in terms of how they want to proceed.\nQ: Do you or Duncan have a better jump shot?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Duncan much better. That one's an easy one.\nAll right. Mary-Anne (ph) (INAUDIBLE)?\nQ: (INAUDIBLE) all of their achievements, there have still been many who believe they could do much better. Families wrestle with where to go to school...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nQ: ... you yourself have sent your daughters to private schools. What kind of commitment can you make for resources now, as president for the public school system. Do you agree with Arne Duncan's proposal of cash incentives -- giving kids who receive A's and B's, perhaps, $100? And what did the mayor say when you told him that you were taking Arne Duncan away from Chicago?\n[LAUGHTER]\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: The...\nQ: (INAUDIBLE) I had to get them all in.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I understand.\nWell, first of all, I think Arne, Joe, myself, all agree that the Chicago public schools aren't as good as they need to be, and that the vast majority of schools that are under performing can do better. That's our job: To raise expectations for parents, for students, for principles, for school administrators. And that's what Arne has consistently done.\nWhat I've been so impressed with is the dedication that he has -- has shown in continuous steady improvement. And that's what we're looking for.\nLook, we're not going to transform every school overnight. And there's some school systems -- not just big city school systems -- there are rural schools and suburban schools that just aren't up to snuff. But what -- what we can expect is that each and every day we are thinking of new, innovative ways to make the schools better. That's what Arne's done. That's going to be his job. That's going to be his task.\nAnd one of the things that Arne and I share, I think, is a deep pragmatism in terms of how we go about this.\nIf -- if pay-for-performance works and we can work with teachers so they don't feel like it's being imposed on them but instead they've got an option for different compensation mechanisms in order for us to encourage high performance, then that's something we should explore. If charter schools work, let's try that. You know, let's not be clouded by ideology when it comes to figuring out what helps our kids.\nAnd I think Mayor Daley could not be prouder of Arne Duncan and the fact that the same dedication, hard work that he has shown here in Chicago he's going to be able to show to the entire country.\nOK. Carol Lee? Where Carol? Carol from (INAUDIBLE).\nThere you go.\nQ: (OFF-MIKE) you had said before that you were going to appoint a number of Republicans to you Cabinet, and so far we haven't seen that many. Do you -- what can we expect in that area?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'm not giving you a preview. We've got some more appointments to make. And I think that when you look at our entire White House staff and Cabinet and various appointments, I think people will feel that we followed through on our commitment to make sure that this is not only an administration that is diverse ethnically but it's also diverse politically and it's diverse in terms of people's life experience.\nArne's somebody who has really been working on the ground, for example. You know, he's not a creature of Washington. That's not where he cut his teeth. He cut his teeth working with kids individually, working in schools like this.\nYou know, we have other people, obviously, who have Washington experience, and I think that blend is going to make us extraordinarily effective on not just our education agenda but our broader agenda to help American families live out the American dream.\nOK.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85080", "text": "Good afternoon, everybody.\nOver the past few weeks, Vice President-elect Biden and I have announced key members of our economic and national security teams. In the 21st century, we know that the future of our economy and national security is inextricably linked with one challenge: energy.\nSo today we're pleased to introduce the majority of the team that will lead our efforts on energy and the environment. I say the majority, because we are going to be doing separate announcements for the secretary of the interior, who's going to have a lot to do on energy policy. And, obviously, interior or — transportation and agriculture will be important, as well.\nIn the next few years, the choices that we make will help determine the kind of country and world that we will leave to our children and our grandchildren.\nAll of us know the problems that are rooted in our addiction to foreign oil. It constrains our economy, shifts wealth to hostile regimes, and leaves us dependent on unstable regions. These urgent dangers are eclipsed only by the long-term threat of climate change, which, unless we act, will lead to drought and famine abroad, devastating weather patterns, and terrible storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline at home.\nFor over three decades, we've listened to a growing chorus of warnings about our energy dependence. We've heard president after president promise to chart a new course. We've heard Congress talk about energy independence, only to pull up short in the face of opposition from special interests.\nWe've seen Washington launch policy after policy, yet our dependence on foreign oil has only grown, even as the world's resources are disappearing.\nThis time has to be different. This time we cannot fail, nor can we be lulled into complacency simply because the price at the pump has for now gone down from $4 a gallon.\nTo control our own destiny, America must develop new forms of energy and new ways of using it. And this is not a challenge for government alone; it's a challenge for all of us.\nThe pursuit of a new energy economy requires a sustained all- hands-on-deck effort, because the foundation of our energy independence is right here in America, in the power of wind and solar, in new crops and new technologies, in the innovation of our scientists and entrepreneurs and the dedication and skill of our workforce.\nThose are the resources that we have to harness to move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy.\nAs we face this challenge, we can seize boundless opportunities for our people. We can create millions of jobs, starting with a 21st- century economic recovery plan that puts Americans to work building wind farms, solar panels, and fuel-efficient cars.\nWe can spark the dynamism of our economy through a long-term investment in renewable energy that will give life to new businesses and industries with good jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.\nWe'll make public buildings more efficient, modernize our electricity grid, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while protecting and preserving our natural resources. We must also recognize that the solution to global climate change must be global.\nI spoke a few days ago with Senator John Kerry, who updated me on the recent climate negotiations in Poland. Just as we work to reduce our own emissions, we must forge international solutions to ensure that every nation is doing its part.\nAs we do so, America will lead not just at the negotiating table; we will lead, as we always have, through innovation and discovery, through hard work and the pursuit of a common purpose.\nThe team that I have assembled here today is uniquely suited to meet the great challenges of this defining moment.\nOBAMA: They are leading experts and accomplished managers, and they are ready to reform government and help transform our economy so that our people are more prosperous, our nation is more secure, and our planet is protected.\nDr. Steven Chu is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who has been working at the cutting edge of our nation's efforts to develop new and cleaner forms of energy. He blazed trails as a scientist, teacher, and administrator, and has recently led the Berkeley National Laboratory in pursuing new alternative and renewable energies.\nSteven is uniquely suited to be our next secretary of energy as we make this pursuit a guiding purpose of the Department of Energy, as well as a national mission.\nThe scientists at our national labs will have a distinguished peer at the helm. His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science. We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action.\nFor my administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I've chosen Lisa Jackson. Lisa has spent a lifetime in public service at the local, state, and federal level.\nAs commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, she helped make her state a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing new sources of energy. And she has the talent and experience to continue this effort at the EPA.\nLisa also shares my commitment to restoring the EPA's robust role in protecting our air, our water, and abundant natural resources so that our environment is cleaner and our communities are safer.\nNancy Sutley will be an integral part of this team as the chair of my Council on Environmental Quality in the White House. In recent years, we've seen states and cities take the initiative in forging innovative solutions on energy.\nNancy's been at the cutting edge of this effort, working as the regional administrator for the EPA, at the state level in Sacramento, and recently as the deputy mayor for energy and the environment in Los Angeles. Now she will bring this unique experience to Washington and be a key player in helping to make our government more efficient in coordinating our efforts to protect our environment at home and around the globe. Finally, the scope of the effort before us will demand coordination across the government and my personal engagement as president. That's why I'm naming Carol Browner to a new post in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy.\nCarol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security, and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state, and local governments, and partnership with the private sector.\nShe brings the unmatched experience of being a successful and longest-serving administrator of the EPA. She will be indispensable in implementing an ambitious and complex energy policy.\nAs I said before, later this week, I will be announcing my designee for secretary of the interior, which will fill out my energy and environmental team. The Interior Department will play a critical role in meeting the challenges that I've discussed today.\nLooking ahead, I'm confident that we will be ready to begin the journey towards a new energy frontier on January 20th. This will be a leading priority of my presidency and a defining test of our time.\nWe can't afford complacency nor accept more broken promises. We won't create a new energy economy overnight. We won't protect our environment overnight. But we can begin that work right now, if we think anew and if we act anew. Now we must have the will to act and to act boldly.\nSo with that, I'd like to invite my team to say a few words, starting with Dr. Chu.\nCHU: Thank you.\nI'm honored to be selected as the nominee for secretary of energy. In the years ahead, the Department of Energy will be a major force in meeting the challenges that the president-elect has described.\nIts role is to support energy research and development that will lead to innovation in the private sector, to nurture broad-based scientific research that is essential for our future prosperity, and to provide scientific leadership to minimize the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons.\nIn our current economic crisis, people are losing their jobs and homes, companies are collapsing. Some say we have to concentrate exclusively on re-establishing the health of the economy.\nI look forward to being part of the president-elect's team, which believes that we must repair the economy and put us on a path forward towards sustainable energy.\nCHU: In the preface to a study, \"Lighting the Way: Toward a Sustainable Energy Future,\" the two co-chairs, Jose Goldemberg and I, wrote, \"We believe that aggressive support of energy, science and technology, coupled with the incentives that accelerate the development and deployment of innovative solutions, can transform the entire landscape of energy, demand and supply.\"\nWhat the world does in the coming decade will have enormous consequences that will last for centuries. It's imperative that we begin without further delay.\nOn December 10, 1950, William Faulkner spoke at the Nobel banquet in Stockholm. He said, \"I believe that man will not merely endure; he will prevail. He is immortal, because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion, and sacrifice, and endurance.\"\nPresident-elect Obama has set the tone and pace for moving our country forward with optimism and calm determination. I hope to emulate his example. With these virtues, the United States and the world can and will prevail over our economic energy and climate change challenges.\nJACKSON: Mr. President-elect, thank you for your nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency. As an environmentalist, as a public servant, as a native New Orleanian, as a New Jerseyan, and, most importantly, as a mother, there is simply no higher calling for me than to lead this vital agency at this vital time.\nNow more than ever, our country is in need of leadership on a host of urgent environmental challenges that face our communities, our cities, our farms, and our rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans. At the top of the list is the threat of climate change, which requires us to transform how we produce and use energy throughout the economy.\nBut there is much more on the agenda: air pollution, toxic chemicals and children's health issues, redevelopment and waste site cleanup issues, and justice for communities who bear disproportionate risk and have much to gain from your green-collar economic agenda.\nEPA was born in 1970 out of urgency and reflected the American commitment that the environment must be embraced. Its talented staff, engineers, scientists, attorneys will now rise again to meet our nation's 21st-century needs.\nMr. President, if confirmed, I pledge to lead the agency in support of your vision and in cooperation with the immensely talented team you have formed here to answer our country's call and to protect our country's environment.\nI want to thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President-elect.\nAnd I also want to thank my husband, Kenny, and my sons, Marcus and Brian, who are here, for their patience and support. Public service often comes at their expense and much less often, as it does today, at their reward.\nThank you.\nSUTLEY: Thank you, Mr. President-elect, for giving me the opportunity to serve our nation as chair of the Council on Environmental Quality. I'm honored, grateful and humbled.\nIn your campaign, you talked about growing the green economy. You recognized that the challenge to our planet from global warming is a challenge we must meet for ourselves and our children. We must transform our economy and create new jobs and a new prosperity based on sustainability.\nI believe as you do that we can do it. We have seen states like California and cities like Los Angeles take on local and global environmental threats, innovate and create a more sustainable path.\nYou're rightly focused on restoring the federal government to its rightful role as a leader and a partner at home and abroad in protecting public health and our environment.\nMy parents came to the United States with little more than their hopes for a better life. They believed in the power of the American dream.\nMr. President-elect, I promise to you and to the American people that I'll do my part to restore the American dream to its fullest measure by strengthening our economy and creating a more sustainable future. Thank you.\nBROWNER: Thank you, Mr. President-elect and Mr. Vice President- elect. It is a great honor to be a part of America's new team; it is also a tremendous responsibility.\nThis is a pivotal moment in our nation's history. The challenges are immense, but the opportunities are even greater, especially in the interrelated fields of the economy, our security, and our energy and environmental future.\nBROWNER: The American people believe we can do better, and they are right. We can create jobs, curb greenhouse gas emissions, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and help restore America's leadership around the world by shaping an environmentally sustainable world economy.\nTo succeed, we must work together. We must work across party lines. We must enlist both the private and public sectors. And we must summon the best from our partners around the world.\nI am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve in your administration and pledge the full measure of my time and energy to help create a brighter future for the American people.\nThank you.\nBIDEN: Well, Mr. President-elect, what we've seen here today are four very outstanding individuals that you've chosen for something that's been sorely lacking, in my view, the past eight years when it comes to combating climate change and protecting our environment with this clarity, commitment, and a deep conviction that each of the people you've chosen shares.\nThere's no doubt about the challenges in front of us, but there is no putting our heads in the sand, either, as in my view we have done for some time, particularly when it comes to science.\nWelcome, Doctor.\nI — there is — there's no confusion, as well, about the need for us to act.\nIn Carol Browner, we have a proven and forceful advocate for the environment. I've worked with Carol for some years.\nIn Dr. Steven Chu, we have a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who understands that technology and innovation are the cornerstones of solving our energy and climate problems.\nIn Lisa Jackson and Nancy Sutley, we have two individuals who cover us coast to coast, New Jersey to California, who have been in the forefront of these environmental issues in their respective states.\nThe president-elect has made it clear that this will be an administration and a White House — and a White House committed to freeing this nation from its dependence on fossil fuels, and to leading and combating the — the threat of climate change, and reinvigorating our commitment to a cleaner environment.\nAs President-elect Obama and his incredible team lead us in tackling these challenges, I'm proud to assume the office held by a man who — who awakened the world to these issues, Al Gore.\nAnd I pledge to the American people that the office of the vice president will no longer be an obstacle to environmental protection, but it will be, as it was under President Gore, a force for leaping ahead.\nSo, President-elect Obama, congratulations on the team you assembled, and — and the podium is yours.\nOBAMA: OK, let me take some questions.\nLet's start with Stephen Power.\nQUESTION: How quickly does your administration intend to to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions? And do you have any intention of reinstating the ban on off-shore oil drilling that expired a few months ago?\nOBAMA: Well, both are items that my environmental team, as well as my energy team, are going to be reviewing in the weeks to come, but I think it is very important just to look at the history when it comes to the regulation of emissions in California.\nConsistently, California has hit the bar and then the rest of the country has followed. And rather than it being an impediment to economic growth, it has helped to become an engine of economic growth.\nAnd one of the key points that I want to make at this press conference — and I will repeat again and again during the course of my presidency — is there is not a contradiction between economic growth and sound environmental practices.\nI think that the future of innovation and technology is going to be what drives our economy into the future. A new energy economy is going to be part of what creates the millions of new jobs that we need.\nAnd that's why my economic recovery plan is going to be focused on, how can we make a series of down payments on things that we should have done 10 or 20 or 30 years ago but have delayed?\nAnd so we get a twofer: We get a immediate jumpstart to the economy and jobs that are immediately being created on things like a smart grid or working to make our buildings more energy efficient. And, at the same time, we're setting the path for long-term, sustained economic growth.\nOBAMA: With respect to the moratorium on off-shore drilling, what I said during the campaign was that I was open to the idea of off-shore drilling if it was part of a comprehensive package to achieve energy independence.\nI'm not thrilled with it simply lapsing as a consequence of inaction without broader thought to, how are we going to achieve energy independence and reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels?\nSo what this team will be charged with, in part, is figuring out, how can we arrive at a comprehensive energy strategy that meets the goals of our national security, meets the goals of our economy, and meets the goals of preserving our planet for our children?\nMark — Mark Memmott at USA Today?\nQUESTION: Thank you, sir. Sticking with the economy, you've warned that things will probably get worse before they get better. But can you give the American people a sense of when things will start getting better? And how should they hold you accountable? Is it reasonable to expect in a year that we'll be seeing job growth or will we still be in the same situation we are now?\nOBAMA: Well, I want to be completely honest with the American people. I don't have a crystal ball. What I have control of is making the good, smart decisions that lead to long-term, sustainable economic development and growth.\nNow, here's what I'm confident about, that our economic recovery plan, our 21st-century investments will create jobs immediately that would not otherwise be created.\nWe've got shovel-ready projects all across the country that governors and mayors are pleading to fund. And the minute we can get those investments to the state level, jobs are going to be created.\nWe know that there are buildings — school buildings, in particular, but I think public buildings generally — that need to be retrofitted to make them more energy-efficient and that we will get that money back so that not only are we creating jobs, but we're also making those operations more efficient and saving taxpayers money over the long term.\nThat is work that immediately is going to be created as a consequence of the economic recovery plan. So we know that we are going to create jobs that wouldn't otherwise be created. We know that we're going to put ourselves on the path to long-term sustainable growth. We know that we're going to start getting serious about how our federal budget operates so that we're not wasting money on programs that don't work, and we're going to do an exhaustive review.\nWe know that, by setting up the financial regulatory structure that is long overdue, we can prevent this crisis from happening again. And we know that we can put in place the kinds of relief for homeowners and foreclosure prevention plans that help to strengthen the base of the economy.\nAnd it is my expectation that, by doing those things, we are going to create 2.5 million jobs, as I discussed earlier.\nBut my hope, more importantly, is not only are we creating jobs through this economic recovery process, what I'm also looking for is the private sector, the financial system to regain confidence and that, through our actions, we're able to jumpstart an era of innovation that leads to competitiveness in the world economy over the long term.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) yardstick (OFF-MIKE)\nOBAMA: Well, I think the yardstick should be, am I creating these jobs? And are we strengthening our economy?\nSTAFF: Last question.\nOBAMA: All right. Brian Naylor at NPR?\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) on behalf of my Chicago colleagues and others here, I'm — I'm curious. Your office put out a statement earlier today saying that there were no inappropriate contacts between your office and the governor of Illinois. And I'm wondering if you could address reports that your incoming chief of staff did speak with the — the staff of Governor Blagojevich?\nOBAMA: Well, as I said in a press conference last week, I had no contact with the governor's office, and I had no contact with anybody in the governor's office.\nAnd what I indicated last week is that there was nothing that my office did that was in any way inappropriate or related to the charges that have been brought.\nNow, beyond that, as we said in the statement today, we were prepared to release the findings of the review that had been done, which are thorough and comprehensive. The U.S. attorney's office asked us to hold off releasing those for a week.\nSo I would ask for your patience, because I do not want to interfere with an ongoing investigation.\nBut there is nothing in the review that was presented to me that in any way contradicted my earlier statements that this appalling set of circumstances that we've seen arise had nothing to do with my office and that, you know, those facts will be forthcoming to all of you in due course. We just want to make sure that we're not interfering with an ongoing and active investigation.\nOK? All right, guys. Thank you so much.", "timestamp": "2008-12-15", "title": "Remarks in Chicago Announcing Energy and Environment Team"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85078", "text": "Good morning.\nEarlier this week, we learned that the number of Americans filing their first claim for unemployment insurance rose to a nearly 30-year high. This news reflects the pain that's been rippling across this entire economy. Jobs are being cut. Wages are being slashed. Credit is tight and people can't get loans. In cities and towns all across this country, families enter a holiday season with unease and uncertainty.\nTo end this economic crisis, we must end the mortgage crisis where it began. This all started when Americans took out mortgages they couldn't afford. Some were reckless, aware of the risks they were accepting, but many were innocent, tricked by lenders out to make a quick buck. With banks creating securities they could not value, and regulators looking the other way, the problem began infecting the whole economy, leading to the crisis we're now facing.\nOne in ten families who owns a home is now in some form of distress, the most ever recorded. This is deeply troubling. It not only shakes the foundation of our economy, but the foundation of the American Dream. There is nothing more fundamental than having a home to call your own. It's not just a place to live or raise your kids or return after a hard day's work – it's the cornerstone of a family's financial security.\nTo stem the rising tide of foreclosures and strengthen our economy, I've asked my economic team to develop a bold plan that will dramatically increase the number of families who can stay in their homes. But this plan will only work with a comprehensive, coordinated federal effort to make it a reality. We need every part of our government working together – from the Treasury Department to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the agency that protects the money you've put in the bank. And few will be more essential to this effort than the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nFrom providing shelter to those displaced by Katrina to giving help to those facing the loss of a home to revitalizing our cities and communities, HUD's role has never been more important. Since its founding, HUD has been dedicated to tearing down barriers in access to affordable housing – in an effort to make America more equal and more just. Too often, these efforts have had mixed results.\nThat is why we can't keep doing things the old Washington way. We can't keep throwing money at the problem, hoping for a different result. We need to approach the old challenge of affordable housing with new energy, new ideas, and a new, efficient style of leadership. We need to understand that the old ways of looking at our cities just won't do. That means promoting cities as the backbone of regional growth by not only solving the problems in our cities, but seizing the opportunities in our growing suburbs, exurbs, and metropolitan areas. No one knows this better than the outstanding public servant I am announcing today as our next Secretary of Housing and Urban Development – Shaun Donovan.\nAs Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development in New York City, Shaun has led the effort to create the largest housing plan in the nation, helping hundreds of thousands of our citizens buy or rent their homes. Prior to joining Mayor Bloomberg's administration, Shaun worked both in business, where he was responsible for affordable housing investments, and at one of our nation's top universities, where he researched and wrote about housing issues. This appointment represents something of a homecoming for Shaun, who worked at HUD in the Clinton administration, leading an effort to help make housing affordable for nearly two million Americans. Trained as an architect, Shaun understands housing down to how homes are designed, built, and wired.\nWith experience that stretches from the public sector to the private sector to academia, Shaun will bring to this important post fresh thinking, unencumbered by old ideology and outdated ideas. He understands that we need to move past the stale arguments that say low-income Americans shouldn't even try to own a home or that our mortgage crisis is due solely to a few greedy lenders. He knows that we can put the dream of owning a home within reach for more families, so long as we're making loans in the right way, and so long as those who buy a home are prepared for the responsibilities of homeownership.\nIn the end, expanding access to affordable housing isn't just about caring for the least fortunate among us and strengthening our middle class – it's about ending our housing mess, climbing out of our financial crisis, and putting our economy on the path to long-term growth and prosperity. And that is what Shaun and I will work to do together when I am President of the United States.\nThank you.\nShaun Donovan, Nominee for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development A Record of Reform and Expanding Access to Affordable Housing\n*  Donovan Leads the Largest Housing Plan in the Nation; Has helped Hundreds of Thousands of People Own or Rent a Home New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD): HPD's $7.5 Billion New Housing Marketplace Plan to build and preserve 165,000 units of affordable housing for 500,000 New Yorkers is the largest municipal affordable housing plan in the nation. Donovan has been the originator of countless new programs bringing together public and private partnerships. In September 2008, Donovan, together with Mayor Bloomberg, announced that the Plan reached the midway point on schedule with more than 82,500 units funded.\n* Donovan Has Spearheaded Initiatives to Tackle the Subprime and Foreclosure Crisis In 2005, HPD began a program to provide financial education, legal and credit assistance to those most at risk of predatory lending. More recently, HPD has helped to found the Center for New York City Neighborhoods to offer counseling, legal services and education, resources that owners or renters facing eviction due to foreclosure can use to remain in their homes. Just this week, the Center awarded $2.3 million in new grants to help homeowners and announced a new call center linked to New York City's innovative 311 citizen service hotline. HPD's programs have shown that low and moderate-income people can succeed as homeowners - of more than 17,000 new or preserved homes under the New Housing Marketplace plan, only 5 owners have lost their homes to foreclosure.\n* Donovan Led Reforms in New York City that Meant Higher Quality Affordable Housing for Low-Income Residents At HPD, Donovan spearheaded reform of New York City's 421A tax abatement provision, which provides tax breaks to developers who include affordable housing in upscale development projects. Previously, developers could obtain the tax breaks even if they included no low-income housing, or built it at a separate location. Donovan ended that practice, requiring developers who receive the tax break to devote space within a higher-end building to affordable housing, thereby ensuring mixed-income neighborhoods rather than the failed, segregated housing of past housing programs.\n* Donovan Set Standards for Energy Efficiency in Affordable Housing Units Many of the new affordable housing projects during Donovan's tenure at HPD have included LEED green building certifications. Through groundbreaking projects such as an international design competition, the Via Verde development brought together quality design with sustainable, affordable housing. He has also worked on an initiative to retrofit affordable housing rehabilitations with energy-efficient appliances and other energy-saving technology, not only saving excess energy but reducing costs for residents.\n* Donovan Shepherded the Development of Cutting-Edge Funding Mechanisms for Affordable Housing Creation  To compete in a challenging market, Donovan led the creation of the New York City Acquisition Fund, a partnership that combined more than $30 million in philanthropic commitments with sophisticated private finance tools to level the playing field for developers committed to building affordable housing. The Fund has become a model for other cities and won the prestigious 2008 Innovations in American Government Award from Harvard University.\n* Donovan Led the Development of the Country's Most Aggressive Inclusionary Zoning Laws Through Mayor Bloomberg's PlaNYC sustainability initiative, Donovan expanded inclusionary zoning, coupled together with a rezoning plan covering more than one-sixth of the city, to knit neighborhoods together. These more than 60 publicly initiated rezonings focus on transit-oriented and underutilized land with existing infrastructure, paving the way to address projected population growth for the next 20 years; while reducing carbon emissions through access to mass transit, and sustainable development.\n* As Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing at HUD, Donovan Oversaw Over Two Million Housing Units At HUD, Donovan ran housing subsidy programs that provided over $9 billion annually to 1.7 million American families. He oversaw 30,000 multifamily properties with over 2 million housing units, and pioneered new tools for preserving this precious resource.\nCommissioner Shaun Donovan's full biography is below:\nDonovan was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) in March 2004 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Before joining the Bloomberg administration, Mr. Donovan worked at Prudential Mortgage Capital Company as managing director of its FHA lending and affordable housing investments.\nPrior to Prudential, Donovan was a visiting scholar at New York University, where he researched and wrote about the preservation of federally-assisted housing. He was also a consultant to the Millennial Housing Commission on strategies for increasing the production of multifamily housing. The Commission was created by the United States Congress to recommend ways to expand housing opportunities across the nation.\nUntil March of 2001, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing at HUD, the primary federal official responsible for privately-owned multifamily housing. He also served as acting FHA Commissioner during the presidential transition. Prior to joining HUD, Donovan worked at the Community Preservation Corporation (CPC) in New York City, a non-profit lender and developer of affordable housing. He also researched and wrote about housing policy at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and worked as an architect in New York and Italy. He holds Masters degrees in Public Administration and Architecture from Harvard University.", "timestamp": "2008-12-13", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85064", "text": "Before we get into the subject of today's press conference, there are a couple of issues I'd like to address. Today we received more unsettling news about our economy. Jobless claims are now the highest they've been in 26 years, with more than 570,000 people filing for unemployment benefits for the — for the very first time.\nAnd this news comes at a moment when our auto industry is struggling, threatening the jobs, health care, and pensions of not just thousands of American autoworkers, but dealers, suppliers, and others all across America.\nNow, I understand people's anger and frustration at the situation our auto companies find themselves in today. I raised concerns about the health of our auto industry a year-and-a-half ago when I spoke to industry leaders in Detroit. I urged them to act quickly to adopt new technologies and a new business approach that would help them stay competitive in these changing times.\nAnd while they've failed to move quickly enough towards these goals, at this moment of great challenge for our economy, we cannot simply stand by and watch this industry collapse. Doing so would lead to a devastating ripple effect throughout our economy.\nAs I have said repeatedly, I believe our government should provide short-term assistance to the auto industry to avoid a collapse, while holding the companies accountable and protecting taxpayer interests.\nThe legislation in Congress right now is an important step in that direction, and I'm hopeful that a final agreement can be reached this week.\nNow, I'm also aware of your interest in the matter of the Illinois Senate appointment. Let me say that I was as appalled and disappointed as anybody by the revelations earlier this week.\nI have never spoken to the governor on this subject. I'm confident that no representatives of mine would have any part of any deals related to this seat. I think the materials released by the U.S. attorney reflect that fact.\nI've asked my team to gather the facts of any contacts with the governor's office about this vacancy so that we can share them with you over the next few days.\nFinally, on this matter, let me say that this Senate seat does not belong to any politician to trade. It belongs to the people of Illinois, and they deserve the best possible representation.\nThey also deserve to know that any vacancy will be filled in an appropriate way so that whoever is sent to Washington is going to be fighting for the people of Illinois. I hope and expect that the leaders of the legislature will take these steps to ensure that this is so.\nI'd now like to turn to the topic of today's press conference. Over the past few weeks, Vice President Biden and I have announced key members of our economic team who are working as we speak to craft a recovery program that will save and create millions of jobs and grow our struggling economy.\nToday I'm pleased to announce two leading members of my health care team whose work will be critical to those efforts. Senator Tom Daschle and Dr. Jeanne Lambrew.\nI've asked Tom to serve not just as my secretary of health and human services but also as my director of White House — of my White House office of health reform. As such, he will be responsible not just for implementing our health care plan, he will also be the lead architect of that plan.\nJeanne will serve as deputy director of this office working closing with Tom on these efforts.\nIt's hard to overstate the urgency of this work. Over the past eight years, premiums have nearly doubled and more families are facing more medical debt than ever before. Forty-five million fellow citizens have no health insurance at all. And day after day, we witness the disgrace of parents unable to take a sick child to the doctor, seniors unable to afford their medicines, people who wind up in emergency rooms because they have nowhere else to turn.\nYear after year, our leaders offer up detailed health care plans with great fanfare and promise only to see them fail, derailed by Washington politics and influence peddling.\nThis simply cannot continue. The runaway cost of health care is punishing families and businesses across our country. We're on an unsustainable course and it has to change.\nThe time has come this year in this new administration to modernize our health care system for the 21st century, to reduce costs for families and businesses, and to finally provide affordable, accessible health care for every single American.\nNow, some may ask how at this moment of economic challenge we can afford to invest in reforming our health care system. And I ask a different question. I ask how can we afford not to. Right now, small businesses across America are laying off or shutting their doors for good because of rising health care costs. Some of the largest corporations in America, including major American car makers are struggling to compete with foreign companies unburdened by these costs.\nInstead of investing in research and development, instead of expanding and creating new jobs, our companies are pouring more and more money into a health care system that is failing too many families.\nSo let's be clear. If we want to overcome our economic challenges, we must also finally address your health care challenge. I can think of no one better suited to lead this effort than the man standing beside me today.\nTom Daschle is one of America's foremost health care experts. He and Jeanne have written a groundbreaking book on the subject filled with fresh ideas and creative solutions. And Tom's thinking on this is informed not just by statistics he's studied or policy papers he's read but by his years representing the people of South Dakota witnesses firsthand there struggles as hospitals closed, doctors were few and far between, and care was often out of reach.\nBut Tom brings more than just great expertise to this task. He brings the respect that he earned during his years of leadership in Congress. He knows how to reach across the aisle and bridge bipartisan divides. And he has the trust of folks from every angle of this issue — doctors, nurses, and patients, unions and businesses, hospitals and advocacy groups, all of who will have a seat at the table as we craft our plan.\nAnd once we pass this legislation, I know I can rely on Tom to implement it effectively. A gifted manager, Tom is the original no- drama guy known for speaking softly but leading bolding, always treating his staff with respect while demanding excellence and empowering them to deliver. And I know Tom will bring that same decency, graciousness, and pragmatism to this new role.\nTom could not have a better partner in this work than Jeanne Lambrew. Jeanne bring a depth and range of experience on health care that few can match. She's a leading thinker on this issue, nationally recognized for her research on Medicare, Medicaid, long-term care, and the uninsured.\nShe's a policy and budget expert having served at a senior level at both the Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council. She held lead the effort in the White House to create the Children's Health Insurance Program and she helped craft the president's Medicare reform plan and long-term care initiative.\nAnd like Tom, Jeanne has a personality perfectly suited to reaching out and building consensus. She listens. She treats people well. She, like Tom, believes, as Tom put it in his farewell address to the Senate, that the politics of common ground will not be found on the far right or the far left. That's not where most Americans live. We will only find it in the firm middle ground of common sense and shared values.\nI could not agree more. And I look forward to working with Tom and Jeanne in the months and years ahead.\nWith that, let me ask Tom to step forward and say a few words.\nDASCHLE: Thank you, very much, Mr. President-elect. It is a great honor to be nominated to work on an issue that is so close to my heart, leading an organization that touches so many lives at a time that there is so much at stake.\nThere is no question that fixing health care is and has been for many years our largest domestic policy challenge. We have the most expensive health care system in the world, but are not the healthiest nation in the world.\nOur growing costs are unsustainable, and the plight of the uninsured is unconscionable.\nAddressing our health care challenges will not only mean healthier and longer lives for millions; it will also make American companies more competitive, address the cause of half of all of our personal bankruptcies and foreclosures, and help pull our economy out of its current tailspin.\nThat is why it is so exciting for me to take this dual role that you have outlined today, not just implementing reform, but helping to generate it.\nWhether it's administering Medicare and Medicaid, keeping our food and pharmaceuticals safe, researching the cures of tomorrow, or investing in prevention and wellness, a well-functioning Department of Health and Human Services can play a strong role in tackling the many health care challenges our country faces.\nAnd as director of the White House Office of Health Reform, I'm eager to work closely with the people from across the country to find a path forward that makes health care in this country as affordable and available as it is innovative.\nAs you did so effectively in your campaign, Mr. President-elect, we're also going to bring the American people into this conversation and make health care reform an open and inclusive process that goes from the grassroots up.\nOver the next few weeks, we will be coordinating thousands of health care discussions in homes all across the country through our Web site, Change.gov, where ordinary Americans can share their ideas about what's broken and how to fix it.\nI'll be attending some of these discussions, seeing the ideas generated by others, and looking forward to reporting back to you on what we find.\nOne of the first conversations I had with then-Senate candidate Obama was about the need for meaningful national health care reform. Today I'm grateful to President-elect Obama for giving me the chance to make that a reality.\nI'm honored by your trust, and I look forward to the opportunity to serve our nation once again.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Thanks.\nOK, with that, let me open it up to some questions. Let me start with Jackie, Jackie Calmes.\nQ: Senator — President-elect...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: It's OK.\nQ: ... given the — in your statement, when you addressed the controversy over Governor Blagojevich, you did not repeat what your spokesman said yesterday about having him — that he should resign. Why did you not? And could you tell us what contact, if any, you know that your staff or any emissaries from you have had with prosecutors or the FBI?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, let me repeat a couple of things.\nNumber one, I think, like most of the people of Illinois, I was appalled and disappointed by what we heard in those transcripts. And, you know, here in Illinois — as is true, I think, across the country — there is a tradition of public service, where people are getting in it for the right reasons and to serve, but there's also a tradition where people view politics as a business.\nAnd part of the reason that I got into politics, ran for the State Senate, ran for the United States Senate, and ultimately ran for the presidency is because we have to reclaim a tradition of public service that is about people and their lives, and their hopes, and their dreams. And it isn't about what's in it for me. And I think the public trust has been violated.\nSo let me be absolutely clear: I do not think that the governor at this point can effectively serve the people of Illinois. I — the legislature is going down to Springfield to make a determination as to how to resolve this issue. I think they're going to come to the same conclusion.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I hope that the governor himself comes to the conclusion that he can no longer effectively serve and that he does resign.\nIn terms of our involvement, I'll repeat what I said earlier, which is I had no contact with the governor's office. I did not speak to the governor about these issues. That I know for certain.\nWhat I want to do is to gather all the facts about any staff contacts that I might — may have — that may have taken place between the transition office and the governor's office. And we'll have those in the next few days, and we'll present them.\nBut what I'm absolutely certain about is that our office had no involvement in any deal-making around my Senate seat. That I'm absolutely certain of.\nAnd the — that is — that would be a violation of everything that this campaign has been about. And that's not how we do business.\nSo, you know, I think that, like the rest of the people of Illinois, what I want to see is a quick resolution of this issue. I want to make sure that the next senator from the state of Illinois is carrying a forward tradition of service, that the next senator from Illinois is not tainted by what has taken place so far.\nI want to make sure that the next senator of Illinois is focused on health care, jobs, and all the struggles that the families of this state are going through.\nPhil Elliott, A.P.?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. Thank you. Have you or anyone in your transition or campaign been interviewed as it relates to the criminal complaint? And who is the transition adviser referenced in the complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I have not been contacted by any federal officials. And we have not been interviewed by them. As is reflected in the U.S. attorney's report, we were not, I think, perceived by the governor's office as amenable to any deal-making. And, you know, I won't quote back some of the things that were said about me. So — this is a family program, I know.\nSo, you know — so, beyond that, I'm not really certain where the investigation is going forward. I'll leave Mr. Fitzgerald to address those issues. OK, Mike Flannery, CBS.\nQ: Mr. President-elect, can you shed any light on how it was that the governor got the impression that neither you nor Ms. Jarrett nor any of the people from your office were willing to play ball and why he said those unrepeatable things about you and your — and your staff?\nAnd a two-partner. We have the former — the immediate former governor still moldering in the federal prison here in Terra Haute. What's wrong with politics in Illinois?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, I can't presume to know what was in the mind of the governor during this process, so I won't even speculate on that. All I can do is read what was in the transcripts, like the rest of you have read it, and shake my head.\nNow, with respect to Illinois, look, as I said, I think in Illinois, as is true in American politics generally, there are two views of politics. There's a view of politics that says you go in this for sacrifice and public service, and then there's a view of politics that says that this is a business, and you're wheeling and dealing, and what's in it for me?\nAnd there are — one thing I want to make sure everybody is mindful of — there are extraordinary traditions of public service coming out of Illinois, even after Abraham Lincoln.\nYou know, you've got people like Paul Simon, and Paul Douglas, our current senator, Dick Durbin, our senior senator, and many others on both sides of the aisle who have upheld the highest standards of ethics and have made enormous sacrifices to make sure that they're getting something done for the people of Illinois.\nBut what you also have, I think, are habits and a culture that thinks of politics as a — as a means of self-aggrandizement. That's exactly what has to change.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I mean, this is — if, in fact, the various allegations end up proving to be true — and I don't want to, obviously, prejudge all these issues — this is sort of the far end of the spectrum of that business mentality of politics. But there are more subtle examples of it, right, that are within the lines of legality but still don't fulfill the spirit of service.\nYou know, we know in Washington that lobbyists that disproportionate influence. We know that in state houses and city councils all across America there are times where people are not thinking about what's best for the public good but rather making narrow political calculations. And our whole campaign was about changing that view of politics and restoring a sense that when people of good will come together and are serious about confronting the challenges that we face, that not only can that be good policy but, you know what, it can be good politics as well.\nIt turns out that the American people are hungry for that. And you can get elected by playing it straight. You can get elected by doing the right thing. That's what I hope we have modeled in this campaign. And that's what I intend to model in my administration.\nLast question. Let's see. Debbie Charles of Reuter?\nQ: I want to ask you how are you actually planning to fund your health care program. I know that it has been estimated that it could cost (inaudible) billion dollars. And you had planned, originally, to fund it through getting rid of the tax cuts for the wealthy, but that, apparently, in the current economic situation maybe that's not so reasonable.\nAre you still planning to do that? Or how will you fund it?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, let me start by talking about the issue of costs because central to my health care plan during the campaign, the starting point was how to we reduce costs. How do we gain savings that we can then put into prevention and health IT and making sure that people who don't current have coverage get coverage and families who are seeing their premiums double get relief.\nAnd so what we wanted to make sure of was that any plan that we have starts with the premise that rising costs are unsustainable. We can't simply insure everybody under the current program without bankrupting the government or bankrupting businesses or states.\nSo we're going to spend a lot of time on how do you streamline and rationalize the system. And I think you can fairly expect that we're going to have some very aggressive initiatives around things like health IT, around things like prevention that reduce costs.\nWe're also going to examine programs that I'm not sure are giving us a good bang for the buck. The Medicare Advantage program is one that I've already cited where we're spending billions of dollars subsidizing insurance companies for a program that doesn't appreciably improve the health of seniors under Medicare.\nSo our starting point is savings. Now, we are probably going to have to, then, find additional dollars to pay for some investments in the short term, although, my charge to my team is figuring out how do we make sure that it pays for itself over, say, a ten-year period so that we're actually saving money over the long term.\nAnd I have not made yet a determination in terms of how we're going deal with the rollback of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. That's part of the charge that I've given to my economic advisers working in concert with our health care team.\nToday, we're going to be sitting down and starting to chart out how does this process move forward. And my goal is to make sure that we have everybody involved, doctors, nurses, patient advocates, that we have businesses, labor, everybody sitting around the table, Republicans and Democrats, this is going to be an open and transparent process. You remember I made this promise during the course of the campaign.\nWe're still going to have a bunch of this stuff on CSPAN. We are — Tom has already initiated a process where we're going to have groups around the country who are convening to talk about what they think needs to be placed in a health care plan. My hope is to convene all the interested parties in Washington sometime early in my administration and make sure that we are moving forward, open-minded to all kinds of good ideas, but insistent that the time is now to solve this problem.\nI've met too many families during the course of the campaign before the economic downturn that are desperate. Close to 50 percent of family bankruptcies are caused because of a health care crisis. We know the strains that are being placed on businesses as a consequence of rising health care costs.\nSo this has to be intimately woven into our overall health care — our overall economic recovery plan. It's not something that we can sort of put off because we're in an emergency. This is part of the emergency. And what we want to do is make sure that our strategy reflects that truth.\nOK, thank you, guys. Appreciate it.", "timestamp": "2008-12-11", "title": "Remarks in Chicago Announcing the Nomination of Tom Daschle as Secretary of Health and Human Services"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85041", "text": "Good afternoon.\nEarlier this week, I announced key members of my national security team. They have served in uniform and as diplomats; they have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, and executives. They share my sense of purpose about American leadership in the world, my pragmatism about the use of power, and my vision for how we can protect our people, defeat our enemies, and meet the challenges of the 21st century.\nAs we seek a new national security strategy that uses all elements of American power, we must also remember those who run the greatest risks and make the greatest sacrifices to implement that strategy – the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America. Even as I speak, they are serving brilliantly and bravely in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world. And we must show them and their families the same devotion that they have shown this country.\nWe don't have to do our troops and our veterans a favor, we have a sacred trust to repay one. That starts with recognizing that for many of today's troops and their families, the war doesn't end when they come home. Far too many are suffering from the signature injuries of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury. And far too few are receiving the screening and treatment they need. The servicemen and women who embody what's best about America should get the best care we have to offer, and that is what we will provide when I am President.\nAnd in this struggling economy, we also have to do more to ensure that when our troops come home and leave the service, they can find jobs that pay well, provide good benefits, and help them support their families.\nBut we don't just need to better serve veterans of today's wars. We also need to build a 21st Century VA that will better serve all who have answered our nation's call. That means cutting red tape and easing transition into civilian life. And it means eliminating shortfalls, fully funding VA health care, and providing the benefits our veterans have earned.\nThat is the kind of VA that will serve our veterans as well as they have served us. And there is no one more distinguished, more determined, or more qualified to build this VA than the leader I am announcing as our next Secretary of Veterans Affairs -- General Eric Shinseki. No one will ever doubt that this former Army Chief of Staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans. No one will ever question whether he will fight hard enough to make sure they have the support they need.\nA graduate of West Point, General Shinseki served two combat tours in Vietnam, where he lost part of his foot, and was awarded two Purple Hearts and three Bronze Stars. Throughout his nearly four decades in the U.S. Army, he won the respect and admiration of our men and women in uniform because they have always been his highest priority. He has always stood on principle – because he has always stood with our troops. And he will bring that same sense of duty and commitment to ensuring that we treat our veterans with the care and dignity they deserve.\nA decorated soldier who has served at every level in the Army, General Shinseki understands the changing needs of our troops and their families. And he will be a VA Secretary who finally modernizes our VA to meet the challenges of our time.\nNearly seventy years ago today, \"a date which will live in infamy,\" our harbor was bombed in Hawaii, and our troops went off to war. And after that war was over, after we reclaimed a continent from a madman and beat back danger in the Pacific, those troops came home to a grateful nation – a nation that welcomed them with a GI Bill and a chance to live out in peace the dreams they had fought for, and so many died for, on the battlefield. We owe it to all our veterans to honor them as we honored our Greatest Generation – not just with words, but with deeds.\nAnd with the national security team I announced this week and the extraordinary and courageous Secretary of Veterans Affairs I am announcing today, I am confident that we will never hesitate to defend our security, that we will send our troops into battle only when we must, and that, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, we will truly care for all \"who shall have borne the battle.\"\nNow, I'd like to turn it over to our next VA Secretary, General Eric Shinseki.", "timestamp": "2008-12-07", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect Announcing the Nomination of General Eric K.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85042", "text": "BROKAW: President-elect Obama, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Great to be here. Thank you.\nBROKAW: Very nice to have you with us. As we saw in the opening, the world has gotten considerably worse since your election. There is no evidence that it's cause and effect, you should be happy to know. But, nonetheless, we now are officially in a recession. It's around the world, and most analysts think it's going to get worse before it gets better. Sixty-seven years ago this day, one of your predecessors, Franklin Roosevelt, faced Pearl Harbor.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: What are the differences between his challenges and the ones that you face?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, I think it's important for us to remember that as tough as times are right now, they're nothing compared to what my grandparents went through, what the \"greatest generation\" went through. You know, at this point you already had 25, 30 percent unemployment across the country, and we didn't have many of the social safety nets that emerged out of the New Deal. So there's no doubt that Franklin Roosevelt had to re-create an entire economic structure that had entirely collapsed, and we've got some strengths that he didn't, he didn't have.\nBut, look, if you look at the unemployment numbers that came out yesterday, if you think about almost two million jobs lost so far, if you think about the fragility of the financial system and the fact that it is now a global financial system, so that what happens in Thailand or Russia can have an impact here, and obviously, what happens on Wall Street has an impact worldwide, when you think about the structural problems that we already had in the economy before the financial crisis, this is a big problem and it's going to get worse. And, and one of the things that I'm constantly mindful of are all the people I met during the campaign who were already struggling before things got worse. You know, mothers and fathers who were working hard every day but didn't have health care, couldn't figure out how to send their kids to college. Now they're looking at pink slips, jobs being shipped overseas that devastate entire towns. And that's why my number one priority coming in is making sure that we've got an economic recovery plan that is equal to the task.\nBROKAW: Here's what you had to say a short time ago to the national conference of governors. It was kind of a reality check for them to put it in some kind of a context. Let's share that with our audience now, if we can.\n(Videotape, Tuesday)\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: We're going to have to make hard choices. Like the ones that you're making right now in your state capitals, we're going to have to make in Washington. And we are not, as a nation, going to be able to just keep on printing money; so, at some point, we're also going to have to make some long-term decisions in terms of fiscal responsibility and not all of those choices are going to be popular.\n(End videotape)\nBROKAW: On this program about a year ago, you said that being a president is 90 percent circumstances and about 10 percent agenda. The circumstances now are, as you say, very unpopular in terms of the decisions that have to be made. Which are the most unpopular ones that the country's going to have to deal with?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, fortunately, as tough as times are right now--and things are going to get worse before they get better--there is a convergence between circumstances and agenda. The key for us is making sure that we jump-start that economy in a way that doesn't just deal with the short term, doesn't just create jobs immediately, but also puts us on a glide path for long-term, sustainable economic growth. And that's why I spoke in my radio address on Saturday about the importance of investing in the largest infrastructure program--in roads and bridges and, and other traditional infrastructure--since the building of the federal highway system in the 1950s; rebuilding our schools and making sure that they're energy efficient; making sure that we're investing in electronic medical records and other technologies that can drive down health care costs. All those things are not only immediate--part of an immediate stimulus package to the economy, but they're also down payments on the kind of long-term, sustainable growth that we need.\nBROKAW: To give an indication of how quickly things change now, at warp speed, when you and I last saw each other, six weeks ago, I think it was, in Nashville, when I asked you your priorities, you said health care, energy and education would be your top three priorities.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: You didn't anticipate at that time that you would have to outline this kind of a stimulus program. The real question in the stimulus program that you have just described and as you shared with, with the American audience in your radio address is how quickly will it mean jobs out there across America and how much is it going to cost and who's going to pay for it?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I think we can get a lot of work done fast. When I met with the governors, all of them have projects that are shovel ready, that are going to require us to get the money out the door, but they've already lined up the projects and they can make them work. And now, we're going to have to prioritize it and do it not in the old traditional politics first wave. What we need to do is examine what are the projects where we're going to get the most bang for the buck, how are we going to make sure taxpayers are protected. You know, the days of just pork coming out of Congress as a strategy, those days are over.\nHow much it's going to cost? My economic team is examining that right now. And one of the things I'm very pleased with is how fast we've gotten a first-rate economic team in place, the fastest in modern history. They are busy working, crunching the numbers, looking at the macro-economic data to make a determination as to what the size and the scope of the economic recovery plan needs to be. But it is going to be substantial. One last point I want to make on this is that we are inheriting an enormous budget deficit. You know, some estimates over a trillion dollars. That's before we do anything. And so we understand that we've got to provide a, a, a blood infusion into the patient right now to make sure that the patient is stabilized, and, and that means that we, we can't worry short term about the deficit. We've got to make sure that the economic stimulus plan is large enough to get the economy moving.\nBROKAW: One of the great concerns in this country, of course, is additional job loss, which would be considerable if the Big Three in the auto industry in this country--GM, Ford and Chrysler--were to go down. That drama has been playing out in Washington and across America. Do you think the Big Three deserve to survive?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I, I think that the Big Three U.S. automakers have made repeated strategic mistakes. They have not managed that industry the way they should have, and I've been a strong critic of the auto industry's failure to adapt to changing times--building small cars and energy efficient cars that are going to adapt to a new market. But what I've also said is, is that the auto industry is the backbone of American manufacturing. It is a huge employer across many states. Millions of people, directly or indirectly, are reliant on that industry, and so I don't think it's an option to simply allow it to collapse. What we have to do is to provide them with assistance, but that assistance is conditioned on them making significant adjustments. They're going to have to restructure, and all their stakeholders are going to have to restructure. Labor, management, shareholders, creditors--everybody's going to recognize that they have--they do not have a sustainable business model right now. And if they expect taxpayers to help in that adjustment process, then they can't keep on putting off the kinds of changes that they, frankly, should have made 20 or 30 years ago. If, if they want to survive, then they better start building a fuel-efficient car. And if they want to survive, they, they've got to recognize that the auto market is not going to be as large as some of their rosy scenarios that they've put forward over the last several years.\nBROKAW: It's pretty clear that the Democrats are going to try to get them a bridge loan to get through the short term, but it's the long term that is the larger question here.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: A number of people--Paul Ingrassia, as a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter from The Wall Street Journal has said we ought to have a government-structured bankruptcy and maybe even an automobile czar of some kind. One name that has come up is Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE, the parent company of NBC. Does that kind of plan have any appeal for you?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, there are a lot of discussions taking place right now between members of Congress, the Bush administration. I've had my team have conversations with these folks to see how can you keep the automakers' feet to the fire in making the changes that are necessary. But understand, these aren't ordinary times. You know, some people have said let's just send them through a bankruptcy process. Well, even as large a company as GM, in ordinary times, might be able to go through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, restructure, and still keep their business operations going. When you are seeing this kind of collapse at the same time as you've got the financial system as shaky as, as it is, that means that we're going to have to figure out ways to put the pressure on the way a bankruptcy court would, demand accountability, demand serious changes. But do so in a way that it allows them to keep the factory doors open. And, you know, right now there's a number of discussions about how to do that, and I hope that we're going to see some short-term progress in the next few days. My economic team is focused on what we expect to inherit on January 20th, and we'll have some very specific plans in terms of how to move that forward.\nBROKAW: But help me out here. Are you looking at the possibility of some kind of a government structure that runs that reorganization?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I--we don't want government to run companies. Generally, government historically hasn't done that very well. What we want...\nBROKAW: Not to run the companies but...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: But...\nBROKAW: ...to run the terms.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, what, what we do need is, if taxpayer money is at stake, which it appears may be the case, we want to make sure that it is conditioned on a auto industry emerging at the end of the process that actually works, that actually functions. The last thing I want to see happen is for the auto industry to disappear. But I'm also concerned that we don't put 10 or 20 or 30 or whatever billion dollars into an industry, and then, six months to a year later, they come back hat in hand and say, \"Give me more.\" Taxpayers, I think, are fed up. They're going through extraordinarily difficult times right now, and they want to see the kind of accountability that, that, that, unfortunately, we haven't always seen coming out of Washington.\nBROKAW: But under that organization or any reorganization that you settle on...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: ...should the current management be allowed to stay in their jobs?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Here's what I'll, I'll say, that it may not be the same for all the, all the companies, but what I think we have to put an end to is the head-in-the-sand approach to the auto industry that has been prevalent for decades now. I think, in fairness, you have seen some progress made incrementally in many of these companies. You know, they have been building better cars now than they were 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. They are making some investments in the kind of green technologies and, and the new batteries that would allow us to create plug-in hybrids. What we haven't seen is a sense of urgency and the willingness to make tough decisions. And what we still see are executive compensation packages for the auto industry that are out of line compared to their competitors, their Japanese competitors who are doing a lot better.\nNow, it's not unique to the auto industry. We have seen that across the board. Certainly, we saw it on Wall Street. And part of what I'm hoping to introduce as the next president is a new ethic of responsibility where we say that, if you're laying off workers, the least you can do, when you're making $25 million a year, is give up some of your compensation and some of your bonuses. Figure out ways in which workers maybe have to take a haircut, but they can still keep their jobs, they can still keep their health care and they can still stay in their homes. That kind of notion of shared benefits and burdens is something that I think has been lost for too long, and it's something that I'd like to see restored.\nBROKAW: Let's talk for a moment about consumer responsibility when it comes to the auto industry. As soon as gas prices began to drop, consumers moved back to the larger cars once again, to SUVs and the big gas consumers.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: Why not take this opportunity to put a tax on gasoline, bump it back up to $4 a gallon where people were prepared to pay for that, and use that revenue for alternative energy and as a signal to the consumers those days are gone.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well...\nBROKAW: We're not going to have gasoline that you can just fill up your tank for 20 bucks anymore.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, keep, keep in mind what's happening in--to families all across America. Yes, gas prices have gone down. But, in the meantime, maybe somebody in the family's lost their job. In the meantime, their housing values have plummeted. In the meantime, maybe their hours have been cut back. Or if they're a small-business owner, their sales have gone down 50, 60, 70 percent. So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake. What we have to do long term is make sure that we have an energy strategy that focuses on fuel-efficient cars, that focuses on providing incentives for fuel-efficient cars. Same applies to buildings. We have a enormously inefficient building stock, and we can save huge amounts of energy costs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil by simple things like weatherization and changing the lighting in, in major buildings. That's going to be part of our economic recovery plan. It actually allows us to spend some money, put some people to work right away, but it also creates a long-term, sustainable energy future. And I think making some of those investments in ensuring that we change our auto fleet over the next several years, that's going to be important as well.\nBROKAW: The other big financial storm that continues to build out there, of course, are mortgages. You said recently that is an area of particular concern to you. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Bernanke, said recently that something that--needs to be done urgently. During the course of the campaign, you suggested a three-month moratorium. Is that still part of the policy that you would like to have begun when you become president of the United States? And what else needs to be done to do something about mortgages?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I, I'm having my team examine all the options that are out there. I'm disappointed that we haven't seen quicker movement on this issue by the administration. And we have said publicly and privately that we want to see a package that helps homeowners not just because it's good for that particular homeowner, it's good for the community. When you have foreclosures, property values decline and you get a downward spiral all across America. It's also good for the financial system because keep in mind how this financial system became so precarious in the first place. You, you had a huge amount of debt, a huge amount of other people's money that was being lent, and speculation was taking place on--based on these home mortgages. And if we can strengthen those assets, then that will strengthen the financial system as a whole.\nSo I think a moratorium on foreclosures remains an important tool, an important option. I think we also should be working to figure out how we can get banks and homeowners to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages so that they are sustainable. The vast majority of people who are at threat of foreclosure are still making monthly payments, they want to stay in their homes, they want to stay in their communities, but the strains are enormous. And if we can relieve some of that stress, long term it's going to be better for the banks, it's going to be certainly better for the community, it's going to be better for our economy as a whole. This is going to be a top priority of my administration.\nBROKAW: Have you personally conveyed your disappointment to the administration or had your economic advisers get in touch with Hank Paulson and say, \"Why aren't you doing more about mortgages?\"\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: We, we have specifically said that, moving forward, we have to have a housing component to any actions that we take. If we are only dealing with Wall Street and we're not dealing with Main Street, then we're only handling one-half of the problem.\nBROKAW: And finally, what about those homeowners out there who are struggling to do the responsible thing, to pay their mortgages?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: And now they look across the street and the neighbor may be getting bailed out. So they feel they're the victim of a double whammy.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: They're paying their taxes to bail out the guy across the street and struggling to pay their mortgages. Why wouldn't they just take a walk on their mortgage and say, \"I want in on that\"?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, look, that, that's one of the tricky things that we've got to figure out how to structure. We don't want what you just described, a moral hazard problem where you have incentive to act irresponsibly. But, you know, if my neighbor's house is on fire, even if they were smoking in the bedroom or leaving the stove on, right now my main incentive is to put out that fire so that it doesn't spread to my house. And I think most people recognize that even if there were some poor decisions made by home buyers, that right now our biggest incentive is to make sure that the housing market is strengthened. I do think that we have to put in place a set of rules of the road, some financial regulations that prevent the kind of speculation and leveraging, that we saw, in the future.\nAnd so, as part of our economic recovery package, what you will see coming out of my administration right at the center is a strong set of new financial regulations in which banks, ratings agencies, mortgage brokers, a whole bunch of folks start having to be much more accountable and behave much more responsibly because we can't put ourselves--we, we can't create the kind of systemic risks that we're creating right now, particularly because everything is so interdependent. We've got to have transparency, openness, fair dealing in our financial markets. And that's an area where I think, over the last eight years, we've fallen short.\nBROKAW: Mr. President-elect, we're going to take a break. When we come back, we're going to talk about taxes, the fallout from Mumbai, obviously, Iraq and Afghanistan. A lot more to talk about when we continue here on MEET THE PRESS with this exclusive interview with the President-elect.\n(Announcements)\nBROKAW: We're back with President-elect Obama. We want to talk about taxes. That was a central piece of your campaign. Here's what you had to say.\n(Videotape, April 15, 2008)\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: We need to roll back the Bush-McCain tax cuts and invest in things like health care that are really important. Instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthy, who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, we should be putting a middle class tax cut into the pockets of working families.\n(End videotape)\nBROKAW: Have the economic conditions changed what you hoped to do about taxes? When Bill Daley, your friend and economic adviser, was on this broadcast two weeks ago, and I raised the question about whether you would raise taxes on those earning $250,000 or more a year, he gave a very strong indication that you would probably not do that, you would let the Bush tax cuts play out until 2011. Is that your plan?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, understand what my original tax plan was. It was a net tax cut. Ninety-five percent of working families would get tax relief. To help pay for that, people like you and me, Tom, who make more than a quarter million dollars a year, would play--pay slightly more. We'd essentially go back to the tax rates that existed back in the 1990s. My economic team right now is examining do we repeal that through legislation? Do we let it lapse so that when the Bush tax cuts expire they're not renewed when it comes to wealthiest Americans? And we don't yet know what the best approach is going to be, but the overall thrust is going to be that 95 percent of working families are going to get a tax cut, and the wealthiest Americans, who disproportionately benefited not only from tax cuts from the Bush administration but also disproportionately benefited when it comes to corporate profits and where the gains and productivity were going, they are going to give up a little bit more. And it turns out that...\nBROKAW: But right away or 2011?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, as I said, my economic team's taking a look at this right now. But, but I think the important principle--because sometimes when we start talking about taxes and I say I want a more balanced tax code, people think, well, you know, that's class warfare. No. It, it turns out that our economy grows best when the benefits of the economy are most widely spread. And that has been true historically. And, you know, the real aberration has been over the last 10, 15 years in which you've seen a huge shift in terms of resources to the wealthiest and the vast majority of Americans taking home less and less. Their incomes, their wages have flatlined at a time that costs of everything have gone up, and we've actually become a more productive society.\nSo what we want to do is actually go back to what has been the traditional pattern. We have a broad-based middle class, economic growth from the bottom up. That, I think, will be the recipe for everybody doing better over the long term.\nBROKAW: Your vice president, Joe Biden, said during the course of this campaign it would be patriotic for the wealthy to pay more in taxes. In this economy, does he still believe that?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I--you know, I think what Joe meant is exactly what I described, which is that if, if our entire economic policy is premised on the notion that greed is good and \"What's in it for me,\" it turns out that that's not good for anybody. It's not good for the wealthy, it's not good for the poor, and it's not good for the vast majority in the middle. If we've learned anything from this current financial crisis--think about how this evolved. You had a situation in which you started seeing home foreclosures rise. You had a middle class that was vulnerable and couldn't make payments. Suddenly, all the borrowing that had been--and, and, and all the speculation that had been premised on those folks doing OK, that starts evaporating. Next thing you know, you've got Lehman Brothers going under. People used to think that, well, there, there's no connection between those two things. It turns out that when we all do well, then the economy, as a whole, is going to benefit.\nBROKAW: I want to move now to international affairs, the war on terror. Obviously, we have all been stunned by what happened in India at Mumbai. It is still playing out in that part of the world. You have said that the United States reserves the right to go after terrorists in Pakistan if you have targets of opportunity. Does India now also have that right of hot pursuit?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I'm not going to comment on that. What, what I'm going to restate is a basic principle. Number one, if a country is attacked, it has the right to defend itself. I think that's universally acknowledged. The second thing is that we need a strategic partnership with all the parties in the region--Pakistan and India and the Afghan government--to stamp out the kind of militant, violent, terrorist extremists that have set up base camps and that are operating in ways that threaten the security of everybody in the international community. And, as I've said before, we can't continue to look at Afghanistan in isolation. We have to see it as a part of a regional problem that includes Pakistan, includes India, includes Kashmir, includes Iran. And part of the kind of foreign policy I want to shape is one in which we have tough, direct diplomacy combined with more effective military operations, focused on what is the number one threat against U.S. interests and U.S. lives. And that's al-Qaeda and, and, and their various affiliates, and we are going to go after them fiercely in the years to come.\nBROKAW: President Zardari of Pakistan has said that he expects you to re-examine the American policy of using unmanned missiles for attacks on terrorist camps in Pakistan; and there have been civilian casualties in those attacks as well. Are you re-examining that policy?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I--what I want to do is to create the kind of effective, strategic partnership with Pakistan that allows us, in concert, to assure that terrorists are not setting up safe havens in some of these border regions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. So far President Zardari has sent the right signals. He's indicated that he recognizes this is not just a threat to the United States, but it is a threat to Pakistan as well. There was a bombing in Pakistan just yesterday that killed scores of people, and so you're seeing greater and greater terrorist activity inside of Pakistan. I think this democratically-elected government understands that threat, and I hope that in the coming months that we're going to be able to establish the kind of close, effective, working relationship that makes both countries safer.\nBROKAW: That part of the world is such a hot zone.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: Is it going to be necessary for you to appoint some kind of a special envoy to worry only about South Asia with presidential authority?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, my first job is to make sure that my core national security team--Secretary of State designee Hillary Clinton; Jim Jones, who will be my national security adviser; Bob Gates; Susan Rice, my U.N. representative--that my intelligence folks, when they get appointed, that we come up with a comprehensive strategy. I have enormous confidence in Senator Clinton's ability to rebuild alliances and to send a strong signal that we're going to do business differently and place an emphasis on diplomacy.\nBROKAW: Let's talk for a moment about Iraq. It was a principal--it was one of the principals in the organization of your campaign at the beginning. A lot of people voted for you because they thought you would bring the war in Iraq to an end very swiftly. Here is what you had to say on July 3rd of this year about what you would do once you took office.\n(Videotape)\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I intend to end this war. My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in and I will give them a new mission, and that is to end this war responsibly, deliberately, but decisively.\n(End videotape)\nBROKAW: When does the drawdown of American troops begin and when does it end in Iraq?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, one of my first acts as president, once I'm sworn in, will be to bring in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to bring in my national security team, and design a plan for a responsible drawdown. You are seeing a convergence. When I began this campaign, there was a lot of controversy about the idea of starting to draw down troops. Now you've seen the--this administration sign an agreement with the Iraqi government, both creating a time frame for removing U.S. troops. And so what I want to do is tell our Joint Chiefs, let's do it as quickly as we can do to maintain stability in Iraq, maintain the safety of U.S. troops, to provide a mechanism so that Iraq can start taking more responsibility as a sovereign nation for it's own safety and security, ensuring that you don't see any resurgence of terrorism in Iraq that could threaten our interests. But recognizing that the central front on terror, as Bob Gates said, started in Afghanistan, in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. That's where it will end, and that has to be our priority.\nBROKAW: Jim Jones, who is your new national security adviser, the man that you want to have in that job, who was the Marine commandant when we first went into Afghanistan, I had a conversation with him at that time, and he said to me, \"I know how we're going to get into Afghanistan; I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan.\" What is he telling you today about how we're going to get out of Afghanistan?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I think we're, we're starting to see a consensus that we have to have more effective military action, and that means additional troops, but it also means more effective coordination with our NATO allies. It means that we have to have much more effective diplomacy in the region. We can't solve Afghanistan without solving Pakistan and working more effectively with that country. And we are going to have to make sure that India and Pakistan are normalizing their relationship if we're going to be effective in some of these other areas.\nAnd we've got to really ramp up our development approach to Afghanistan. I mean, part of the problem that we've had is the average Afghan farmer hasn't seen any improvement in his life. You know, we haven't seen the kinds of infrastructure improvements, we haven't seen the security improvements, we haven't seen the reduction in narco trafficking, we haven't seen a reliance on rule of law in Afghanistan that would make people feel confident that the central government can, in fact, deliver on its promises. And if we combine effective development, more effective military work, as well as more effect diplomacy, then I think that we can stabilize the situation. Our number one goal has to be to make sure that it cannot be used as a base to launch attacks against the United States, and we've got to get bin Laden and we've got to get al-Qaeda.\nBROKAW: Here's something else that Afghan farmer has never seen nor have any of his ancestors ever seen this: foreign powers coming into Afghanistan and being effective and staying very long.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right. Well, I, I think that we do have to be mindful of the history of Afghanistan. It is tough territory. And there's a fierce independence in Afghanistan, and if the perception is that we are there simply to impose ourselves in a long-term occupation, that's not going to work in Afghanistan. By the way, that's not going to work in Iraq either. There are very few countries that welcome long-term occupations by foreign powers. But Afghanistan has shown that they are fiercely resistant to that. We're going to have to convince the Afghan people that we're not interested in dictating what happens in Afghanistan. What we are interested in is making sure that Afghanistan cannot be used as a base for launching terrorist attacks. And as long as al-Qaeda and the Taliban, working in concert with al-Qaeda, threaten directly the United States and are engaged in mayhem, then we've got to take action. And, and that very limited goal of making sure that that doesn't happen, I think, can serve as the basis for effective cooperation with the Afghan people.\nBROKAW: Before we leave that part of the world, on Iraq, there's a new phrase that has come into play called \"residual force,\" how many troops will stay behind in an Obama administration. Speculation is 35,000 to 50,000. Is that a fair number?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I'm not going to speculate on the numbers. What I've said is that we are going to maintain a large enough force in the region to assure that our civilian troops--or our, our, our civilian personnel and our, our embassies are protected, to make sure that we can ferret out any remaining terrorist activity in the region, in cooperation with the Iraqi government, that we are providing training and logistical support, maintaining the integrity of Iraq as necessary. And, you know, I--one of the things that I'll be doing is evaluating what kind of number's required to meet those very limited goals.\nBROKAW: Now, two other areas that could be problematic in your administration, I want to deal with them fairly swiftly here if I can. What are the circumstances under which you would open a dialogue with Iran?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I've said before, I think we need to ratchet up tough but direct diplomacy with Iran, making very clear to them that their development of nuclear weapons would be unacceptable, that their funding of terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, their threats against Israel are contrary to everything that we believe in and what the international community should accept, and present a set of carrots and sticks in, in changing their calculus about how they want to operate. You know, in terms of carrots, I think that we can provide economic incentives that would be helpful to a country that, despite being a net oil producer, is under enormous strain, huge inflation, a lot of unemployment problems there. They could benefit from a more open economy and, and being part of the international economic system. But we also have to focus on the sticks, and one of the main things that diplomacy can accomplish is to help knit together the kind of coalition with China and India and Russia and other countries that now do business with Iran to agree that, in order for us to change Iran's behavior, we may have to tighten up those sanctions. But we are willing to talk to them directly and give them a clear choice and, and ultimately let them make a determination in terms of whether they want to do this the hard way or, or the easy way.\nBROKAW: And, briefly, how soon after you take office do you want to meet with the leaders of Russia? And which ones do you meet with? Your counterpart is Medvedev; but, of course, the power behind the throne is Vladimir Putin.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, you know, this is something that we're going to make a determination on. I think that it's going to be important for us to reset U.S.-Russian relations. Russia is a country that has made great progress economically over the last several years. Obviously, high oil prices have helped them. They are increasingly assertive. And when it comes to Georgia and their threats against their neighboring countries, I think they've been acting in a way that's contrary to international norms. We want to cooperate with them where we can, and there are a whole host of areas, particularly around nonproliferation of weapons and terrorism, where we can cooperate. But we also have to send a clear message that they have to act in ways that are not bullying their neighbors.\nBROKAW: You still have some appointments to make coming up, and there's also a good deal of consideration here in Illinois about who will replace you in the Senate. But in New York this weekend the big buzz is Caroline Kennedy in the United States Senate, perhaps as the appointment to fill the seat that Hillary Clinton is expected to vacate if she gets confirmed as secretary of state.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: And?\nBROKAW: Is that a good idea?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, let me tell you this. Caroline Kennedy has become one of my dearest friends and is just a, a wonderful American, a wonderful person. But the last thing I want to do is get involved in New York politics. I've got enough trouble in terms of Illinois politics. But just in terms of our appointments, I am very proud of the speed with which we have started to put together our core economic team, our national security team, but also the excellence of the candidates. And I, I think that it's an indication of part of the change I was talking about during the campaign, an emphasis on competence, an emphasis on people who are nonideological and pragmatic and just want to do business.\nYou know, tomorrow, you had mentioned earlier, is when we commemorate Pearl Harbor, and so I'm going to be making announcement tomorrow about the head of our Veterans Administration, General Eric Shinseki, who was a commander and has fought in Vietnam, Bosnia, is, is somebody who has achieved the highest level of military service. He has agreed that he is willing to be part of this administration because both he and I share a reverence for those who serve. I grew up in Hawaii, as he did. My grandfather is in the Punchbowl National Cemetery. When I reflect on the sacrifices that have been made by our veterans and I think about how so many veterans around the country are struggling, even more than those who have not served--higher unemployment rates, higher homeless rates, higher substance abuse rates, medical care that is inadequate--it breaks my heart. And I think that General Shinseki is exactly the right person who's going to be able to make sure that we honor our troops when they come home.\nBROKAW: He's the man who lost his job in the Bush administration because he said that we would need more troops in Iraq than Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld thought that we would need at that time.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: He was right.\nBROKAW: And General Shinseki was right.\nLet me ask you as we conclude this program this morning about whether you and Michelle have had any discussions about the impact that you're going to have on this country in other ways besides international and domestic policies. You're going to have a huge impact, culturally, in terms of the tone of the country.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Right.\nBROKAW: Who are the kinds of artists that you would like to bring to the White House?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Oh, well, you know, we have thought about this because part of what we want to do is to open up the White House and, and remind people this is, this is the people's house. There is an incredible bully pulpit to be used when it comes to, for example, education. Yes, we're going to have an education policy. Yes, we're going to be putting more money into school construction. But, ultimately, we want to talk about parents reading to their kids. We want to invite kids from local schools into the White House. When it comes to science, elevating science once again, and having lectures in the White House where people are talking about traveling to the stars or breaking down atoms, inspiring our youth to get a sense of what discovery is all about. Thinking about the diversity of our culture and, and inviting jazz musicians and classical musicians and poetry readings in the White House so that, once again, we appreciate this incredible tapestry that's America. I--you know, that, I think, is, is going to be incredibly important, particularly because we're going through hard times. And, historically, what has always brought us through hard times is that national character, that sense of optimism, that willingness to look forward, that, that sense that better days are ahead. I think that our art and our culture, our science, you know, that's the essence of what makes America special, and, and we want to project that as much as possible in the White House.\nBROKAW: Finally, Mr. President-elect, the White House is a no-smoking zone, and when you were asked about this recently by Barbara Walters, I read it very carefully, you ducked. Have you stopped smoking?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: You know, I have, but what I said was that, you know, there are times where I've fallen off the wagon. Well...\nBROKAW: Well, wait a minute.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: ...what can I tell...\nBROKAW: Then that means you haven't stopped.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, the--fair enough. What I would say is, is that I have done a terrific job under the circumstances of making myself much healthier, and I think that you will not see any violations of these rules in the White House.\nBROKAW: Mr. President-elect, thank you very much for being with us today.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Thank you. I really enjoyed it.\nBROKAW: And I know that I speak not just for MEET THE PRESS, but for all of America when I saw we wish you only the very best.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, Tom, thank you and congratulations on doing such a great job on this show.\nBROKAW: Well, these were circumstances none of us, none of us wanted to have, but Tim remains with us in a lot of ways, as you know.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: He does.\nBROKAW: Thanks for being with us.", "timestamp": "2008-12-07", "title": "Interview with Tom Brokaw on NBC's \"Meet the Press\""}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85034", "text": "Good morning.\nYesterday, we received another painful reminder of the serious economic challenge our country is facing when we learned that 533,000 jobs were lost in November alone, the single worst month of job loss in over three decades. That puts the total number of jobs lost in this recession at nearly 2 million.\nBut this isn't about numbers. It's about each of the families those numbers represent. It's about the rising unease and frustration that so many of you are feeling during this holiday season. Will you be able to put your kids through college? Will you be able to afford health care? Will you be able to retire with dignity and security? Will your job or your husband's job or your daughter's or son's job be the next one cut?\nThese are the questions that keep so many Americans awake at night. But it is not the first time these questions have been asked. We have faced difficult times before, times when our economic destiny seemed to be slipping out of our hands. And at each moment, we have risen to meet the challenge, as one people united by a sense of common purpose. And I know that Americans can rise to the moment once again.\nBut we need action – and action now. That is why I have asked my economic team to develop an economic recovery plan for both Wall Street and Main Street that will help save or create at least two and a half million jobs, while rebuilding our infrastructure, improving our schools, reducing our dependence on oil, and saving billions of dollars.\nWe won't do it the old Washington way. We won't just throw money at the problem. We'll measure progress by the reforms we make and the results we achieve -- by the jobs we create, by the energy we save, by whether America is more competitive in the world.\nToday, I am announcing a few key parts of my plan. First, we will launch a massive effort to make public buildings more energy-efficient. Our government now pays the highest energy bill in the world. We need to change that. We need to upgrade our federal buildings by replacing old heating systems and installing efficient light bulbs. That won't just save you, the American taxpayer, billions of dollars each year. It will put people back to work.\nSecond, we will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s. We'll invest your precious tax dollars in new and smarter ways, and we'll set a simple rule – use it or lose it. If a state doesn't act quickly to invest in roads and bridges in their communities, they'll lose the money.\nThird, my economic recovery plan will launch the most sweeping effort to modernize and upgrade school buildings that this country has ever seen. We will repair broken schools, make them energy-efficient, and put new computers in our classrooms. Because to help our children compete in a 21st century economy, we need to send them to 21st century schools.\nAs we renew our schools and highways, we'll also renew our information superhighway. It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption. Here, in the country that invented the internet, every child should have the chance to get online, and they'll get that chance when I'm President – because that's how we'll strengthen America's competitiveness in the world.\nIn addition to connecting our libraries and schools to the internet, we must also ensure that our hospitals are connected to each other through the internet. That is why the economic recovery plan I'm proposing will help modernize our health care system – and that won't just save jobs, it will save lives. We will make sure that every doctor's office and hospital in this country is using cutting edge technology and electronic medical records so that we can cut red tape, prevent medical mistakes, and help save billions of dollars each year.\nThese are a few parts of the economic recovery plan that I will be rolling out in the coming weeks. When Congress reconvenes in January, I look forward to working with them to pass a plan immediately. We need to act with the urgency this moment demands to save or create at least two and a half million jobs so that the nearly two million Americans who've lost them know that they have a future. And that's exactly what I intend to do as President of the United States.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2008-12-06", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84981", "text": "Good morning, everybody.\nLast week Vice President-Elect Biden and I began the process of announcing our economic team. Today we are pleased to name another key member of this team: our nominee for secretary of Commerce, my great friend Governor Bill Richardson.\nWith each passing day, the work our team has begun, developing plans to revive our economy, becomes more urgent. Earlier this week, we learned that the U.S. economy has been in recession since December of 2007 and that our manufacturing output is at a 26-year low — two stark reminders of the magnitude of the challenges we face.\nBut while I know rebuilding our economy won't be easy and it won't be — happen overnight, I also know this: that right now, somewhere in America, a small business is at work with the next big idea; a scientist is on the cusp of the next big breakthrough discovery; an entrepreneur is sketching plans for the start-up that will revolutionize an industry.\nRight now, across America, the finest products in the world are rolling off our assembly lines, and the proudest, most determined, most productive workers in the world are on the job, some already in their second shift of the day, many putting in longer hours than ever before.\nAfter nearly two years of traveling across this country, meeting with workers, visiting businesses large and small, I am more confident than ever that we have everything we need to renew our economy; we've got the ingenuity, the technology, the skill and commitment; we just need to put it to work. It's time to not just address the immediate economic threats, but to start laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity, to help American businesses grow and thrive at home, and expand our efforts to promote American enterprise around the world.\nThis work is the core mission of the secretary of Commerce. And with his breadth and depth of experience in public life, Governor Richardson is uniquely suited for this role as a leading economic diplomat for America.\nDuring his time in state government and Congress, and in two tours of duty in the Cabinet, Bill has seen from just about every angle what makes our economy work and what keeps it from working better.\nAs governor of New Mexico, Bill showed how government can act as a partner to support our businesses, helping to create 80,000 new jobs. And under his leadership, New Mexico saw the lowest unemployment rate in decades.\nAs a former secretary of Energy, Bill understands the steps we must take to build a new clean-energy industry and create the green jobs of the 21st century — jobs that pay well and won't be outsourced, jobs that will help us end our dependence on foreign oil.\nHe understands that the success of today's business, in Detroit or Columbus, often depends on whether it can sell products in places like Santiago or Shanghai. And he knows that America's reputation in the world is critical, not just to our security but to our prosperity — (coughs) — excuse me — that when the citizens of the world respect America's leadership, they are more likely to buy America's products.\nTo this crucial work of restoring America's international standing, Bill will bring a leadership style all his own. Bill has never been content to just learn from briefing books, never satisfied with only the official version of the story.\nDuring his time in Congress, he held more than 2,500 town-hall meetings so he could hear directly from constituents. He was a regular in the U.N. cafeteria, mixing it up with U.N. employees over lunch. And during his 2002 campaign for record — for governor, he actually broke a world record by shaking nearly 14,000 hands in just eight hours. I've got to check that statistic.\nAll of this reflects a determination to reach out and understand where people are coming from, what they hope for, and what he can do to help. This approach, I believe, has been the key to Bill's success as a negotiator and will be key to his work on the critical functions of the Commerce Department, from administering our census and monitoring our climate to protecting our intellectual property and restoring our economic diplomacy.\nIn the end, Bill Richardson is a leader who shares my values. And he must — and he will be — measure his progress the same way I do. Are we creating good jobs instead of losing them? Are incomes growing instead of shrinking?\nI know Bill will be an unyielding advocate for American business and American jobs, at home and around the world. And I look forward to working with him in the years ahead.\nWith that, I'd like Bill to say a quick word.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Mr. President-elect, this is a great honor.\nThere are some who speak of a team of rivals. But I've never seen it that way. Past competitors, yes, but rivals implies something harder-edged and less forgiving. And in the worlds of diplomacy and commerce, you open markets and minds not with rivalry but instead with partnership and innovation and hard work. There's a vital role for the Department of Commerce in our economic recovery.\nThe official role of the department is job creation, economic growth, sustainable development and improving living standards, the same goals of your economic plan, Mr. President-elect. The unique strengths of the department and its talented public servants make it the natural agency to serve as the programmatic nerve center in America's struggle to rejuvenate our economy.\nThe catchphrases of your economic plan — investment, public- private partnerships, green jobs, technology, broadband, climate change and research — that is the Department of Commerce.\nBoosting commerce between states and nations is not just a path to solvency and growth; it's the only path.\nWith your leadership, Mr. President-elect, America will once again be a forefront of innovation, especially in the new frontier of energy independence and clean-energy jobs. We will create technologies the world is seeking while creating millions of new jobs that can never be outsourced. We will revitalize our nation's historic strength in manufacturing while restoring our position of respect in the world.\nAnd finally, let me say how proud I've been to serve as governor of the state that I love. New Mexico, I will never forget you, and I will forever be grateful. And to Barbara, my wife, and the rest of my family, thank you.\n\"Al resto de la comunidad Latina, gracias por su apoyo y su confianza. Gracias por sus votos a nuestro candidato y ahora presidente-electo. Como el nos dijo, si se puede. Y nuestro voto ha sido nuestra voz. Esta eleccion ha demostrado nuestra fuerza y nuestro unidad. Tenemos que seguir luchando por nuestros derechos al mismo tiempo que perseguimos el sueno Americano para todos. A los millones de habitantes de America Latina y el Caribe, hay que fortalecer nuestros nexos y recordar la importancia de una — (inaudible) — unido.\"\nAnd it will be a great honor to serve once again a president who recognizes that America's diverse heritage is its greatest strength. Thank you.\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: All right. Let's see who we got here. The problem is — do we have — do we have — is it somewhere around here? Ah, here we go. (Laughter.) It was here. It was just hiding. Andy, I was not going to call on you again. (Laughter.)\nAll right. Let's start with Julianna Goldman of Bloomberg.\nQ: Thank you --\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: Who was one of the originals, by the way. She was there every step of the way during this campaign.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nGM and Chrysler say that they will be out of cash by the end of the month. One possible short-term fix is to modify the existing $25 billion federal loan program to retool plants. Would you support that? And will you also ask Speaker Pelosi to support using these funds if necessary to avoid a GM bankruptcy?\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: Well, there are going to be hearings over the next two days, and I want to wait and see specifically what's said during those hearings. I think Congress did the right thing. When the Big Three automakers came before them a couple of weeks ago, they were not offering a clear plan for viability over the long term.\nAnd I think Congress was right to say that the taxpayers expect and deserve better than that before they are stepping up to the plate for any kind of bailout.\nIt appears, based on reports that we've seen, that this time out, the executives from these automakers are putting forward a more serious set of plans. I don't want to comment on them before I've actually heard and seen what they're putting forward, but I'm glad that they recognize the expectations of Congress — certainly, my expectations — that we should maintain a viable auto industry, but we should also make sure that any government assistance that's provided is designed for a — is based on realistic assessments of what the auto market is going to be and a realistic plan for how we're going to make these companies viable over the long term.\nWith respect to TARP versus 136 money, at this point, I'm more interested in seeing whether or not there's a sound plan there. And then I'll be in discussions and listening about where the best sources of money are. But I think it's premature to get into that issue. All right. Vincente?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. What do you think about the articles like the one today in the New York Times that say or mention that the announcement of Bill Richardson for secretary of Commerce are the — somehow the consolation prize for Latinos and Hispanic politicians and groups that are calling Latinos to be included in your cabinet, since many were expecting or hoping that Bill Richardson was going to be secretary of State?\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: Well, Commerce secretary is a pretty good job, you know. It's a member of my key economic team that is going to be dealing with the most significant issue that America faces right now — and that is, how do we put people back to work and rejuvenate the economy? Bill Richardson has been selected because he is the best person for that job and is going to be outstanding in helping me strategize on how do we rebuild America; how do we get businesses moving; how do we export effectively; how do we open up new markets for American products and services?\nHis mixture of diplomatic experience, hands-on experience as a governor, experience in the Cabinet, experience in Congress means that he is going to be a key strategist on all the issues that we work on. And so the — so I think the notion that somehow the Commerce secretary is not going to be central to everything we do is fundamentally mistaken.\nWith respect to Latino Cabinet members, I've appointed about half of my Cabinet so far.\nAnd I think that when people look back and see the entire slate, what they will say is, not only in terms of my Cabinet but in terms of, but in terms of my White House staff, I think, people are going to say, this is one of the most diverse Cabinets and White House staffs of all time. But more importantly they're going to say, these are all people of outstanding qualifications and excellence.\nSo you know, one of the strong beliefs that I've always held and has been proven to be correct, throughout my career, is that there's no contradiction between diversity and excellence. I'm looking for the best people, first and foremost, to serve the American people. It just so happens that Bill Richardson is one of those people.\nWendell. Where? There you are. How are you?\nQ: Mr. President-elect, thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: You bet.\nQ: I'm just fine, sir. Thank you for calling on me.\nSecretary Paulson has indicated that the initial tranche, initial half of the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program that he is able to spend, without asking Congress, is almost gone, down to about $15 billion. I wonder if you are concerned that he may be well into the second half of that before you are sworn in, sir.\nAnd if I also may ask the governor, what happened to the beard, sir? (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: I'm going to answer this question about the beard. I think it was a mistake for him to get it — get rid of it. I thought that whole western, rugged look was really working for him. (Laughter.)\nFor some reason, maybe because it was scratchy when he kissed his wife, he was forced to get rid of it. But we're deeply disappointed with the loss of the beard. (Laughter.)\nWith respect to TARP, until Secretary Paulson indicates publicly that he's drawing down the second tranche, the second half of the TARP money, it would be speculation on my part to suggest that that money is going to be used up.\nUnderstand that in order for that second half to be released, it is necessary to notify Congress. And Congress has the ability to block it. I will say that my team has been reviewing very carefully how the TARP program has proceeded.\nOne of my central principles, when I, when I first examined the TARP proposal, was to insist that there was going to be strong oversight. The GAO report has now come out.\nWe're seeing some areas where we can be doing better, in making sure that this money is not going to CEO compensation, that it's protecting taxpayers, and that the taxpayers are going to get their money back; that it's effective in shoring up our financial markets.\nAnd so what I can assure you is that my team is very active in reviewing what's already been done, to ensure that when we hit the ground running on January 20th, that any taxpayer money is going to be properly spent.\nOne last component of that that I think has to be emphasized, and I've said this before, we've got to start helping homeowners in a serious way prevent foreclosures. The deteriorating assets in the financial markets are rooted in the deterioration of people being able to pay their mortgages and stay in their homes. And if we help Main Street, ultimately we're going to help Wall Street. So that's an area that I'm particularly interested in. All right? Okay. Thanks, guys.", "timestamp": "2008-12-03", "title": "Remarks in Chicago Announcing the Nomination of Bill Richardson as Secretary of Commerce"}

Thank you.\nI always love events where seating is done by when your state entered the union. That's when it's good to be a Delawarean, and it's good to see Governor-elect Jack Markell here.\nOver the course of the campaign, I had the opportunity to travel through many of your states.\nOften, I'd be on a bus, and one of you -- or a local official -- would point out local landmarks.\nAnd the commentary was almost always, \"This used to be.\"\nThis \"used to be\" a steel mill. This town \"used to be\" the ceramics capital of America.\nThis factory \"used to\" employ 1,200 people. A company \"used to have\" their headquarters here.\nWe'll know we've turned the corner when we hear a lot less \"This used to be...\" and a lot more \"this is going to be.\"\nIn order to get to \"This is going to be\" we need to build a partnership with you -- that is much more robust and much deeper.\nAnd in doing that, the partnership we're able to build with all of you is crucial.\nEric Sevareid once told President Kennedy that: \"It doesn't make much sense when two people are sitting in a boat for one of them to point a finger accusingly at the other and say `your end of the boat is sinking.'\"\nOur nation can't succeed unless our states succeed.\nBarack and I recognize this.\nAnd we recognize that you've all been incredibly hard hit by this economic crisis.\nAlready 41 states are looking at budget shortfalls this year or next.\nThat is why help for you -- everything from direct aid, to countercyclical investments, to benefit programs, to infrastructure investment -- will be key parts of our economic plan.\nOn infrastructure specifically, we have a huge opportunity. China invests 7-9 percent of its GDP in infrastructure projects. We invest just 1 percent. There's a reason they have a mag-lev train that can go over 200 miles per hour.\nI may have a bit of a pro-rail bias, but think of the jobs we could create -- in both construction and innovation -- if we made similarly bold investments here.\nWe should fast-track funding for the thousands of ready-to-go projects across the country that can quickly put people back to work and lay the foundation for long-term growth.\nIn the longer term, we are calling for the creation of a new National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank that will help us make the investments we need to build a 21st century transportation system -- while creating jobs and taking the politics out of infrastructure spending. And it has the added benefit of making American business more competitive in the world.\nWe believe that, together, we can make this country again, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a place \"of beginnings, of projects, of vast designs and expectations.\"\nDespite all of our challenges, I'm struck by how hopeful our nation remains...\n... People understand the serious challenges we face -- but they also believe that with leadership in Washington and in your states that gives people the chance to succeed -- there's nothing we can't do.\nWe should view this moment of challenge as a moment of great opportunity ---\nPerhaps most importantly, Barack understands that change is a means, and not an end. And together, we can change \"this used to be\" into \"this is going to be.\"\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce a man who has inspired this nation, and who I am honored to join as a partner in leading this nation.\nPlease join me in welcoming President-elect Barack Obama.", "timestamp": "2008-12-02", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President-Elect at the National Governors Association Meeting"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84941", "text": "Good morning.\nIt always feels like a bit of a homecoming when I meet with governors. Because while I stand here today as President-elect, I will never forget the eight years I served in the state Senate in Illinois. It is in state and local government that the rubber hits the road. Of all our elected leaders, you are the ones people count on most to solve the problems in their communities and to help them get by in difficult times. And it's your state governments that bear some of the toughest burdens when an economic crisis strikes.\nThat is what we're seeing today.\nEvery one of you is struggling to come up with a budget at a time when you're facing great and growing needs. More and more people are turning to you for help with health care or affordable housing -- even as tightening credit markets and falling tax revenues make it more and more difficult to provide that help.\nForty-one states are likely to face budget shortfalls this year or next, forcing you to choose between reining in spending and raising taxes. Jobs are being cut. Programs for the needy are at risk. Libraries, parks, and historic sites are being closed. Right here in Philadelphia, over two hundred workers are being laid off -- and hundreds more unfilled positions are being eliminated.\nMeanwhile, virtually all of you are facing the additional challenge of a state constitution that requires you to balance your budget, leaving you with the impossible choice of either helping families at the risk of violating your constitution or upholding your constitution at the expense of helping families.\nTo solve this crisis and to ease the burden on our states, we need action -- and action now. That means passing an economic recovery plan for both Wall Street and Main Street that jumpstarts our economy, helps save or create two and a half million jobs, puts tax cuts into the pockets of hard-pressed middle class families, and makes a down payment on the investments we need to build a strong economy for years to come.\nBut we also have to recognize that any true solution will not come from Washington alone. It will come from all of you. It will come from the White House and the State House working together every step of the way. That is the kind of strong partnership I intend to build as President of the United States.\nToday is our chance to lay the foundation for that partnership. Over the next few hours, I look forward to hearing about the problems you're facing, learning about the work you're doing, and discussing some of the ways we can work together to reduce health care costs, rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges, and schools, and ensure that more families can stay in their homes.\nBut the partnership we begin here must not -- and will not -- end here. As President, I will not simply ask our nation's governors to help implement our economic recovery plan. I will ask you to help design that plan. Because if we're listening to our governors, we'll not only be doing what's right for our states, we'll be doing what's right for our country. That's how we'll grow our economy -- from the bottom-up. And that's how we'll put America on the path to long-term prosperity.\nMake no mistake: these are difficult times, and we're going to have to make hard choices in the months ahead about how to invest precious tax dollars and how to save them -- hard choices like the ones you're making right now. I won't stand here and tell you that you'll like all the decisions I make. You probably won't. But I promise you this -- as President, I will seek your counsel. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And we will once again be true partners in the work of rebuilding our economy, strengthening our states, and lifting up our entire country.\nTo our Republican colleagues, let me just say a special word. I offer you the same hand of friendship and cooperation that I offer our Democratic governors. We have a strong and vibrant democracy. We compete vigorously during an election. But with the end of that season comes the time to govern together -- and that time is now.\nIt was Justice Brandeis who said, during a period of far greater turmoil in our markets, that one of the blessings of our democracy was that -- and I quote -- \"a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory,\" experimenting with innovative solutions to its economic problems. That is the spirit of courage and ingenuity that so many of you embody. And that is the spirit I want to reclaim in this country -- one where our states are testing new ideas, where Washington is investing in what works, and where you and I are working in partnership to move this country forward.

Thank you for allowing me to send my greetings and to share a few words with you on this special day. It's my privilege to thank Pastor Rick, Kay, and all of you for your leadership in the struggle against HIV/AIDS, and your steadfast commitment to eradicating this disease.\nOn this twentieth anniversary of World AIDS Day, I think it's appropriate to look back for a moment to when this day was first observed. In 1988, when ministers of health from around the world first had the notion to set aside a day to highlight the threat of HIV/AIDS, they faced widespread ignorance and fear. Back then, many refused to even acknowledge the existence of this disease, let alone the devastating impact it was having on families and communities around the world.\nToday, because of the work of people like you, women in Kenya who were widowed by the disease, and once shunned by society, have banded together to support and empower each other. Scientists around the world are discovering and engineering new medicines to give people with HIV/AIDS another chance at life. NGOs and faith-based institutions are marshaling the best of the human spirit to help those affected. And world governments are coming together to address the humanitarian crisis the pandemic has left in its wake. I salute President Bush for his leadership in crafting a plan for AIDS relief in Africa and backing it up with funding dedicated to saving lives and preventing the spread of the disease. And my administration will continue this critical work to address the crisis around the world.\nBut we must also recommit ourselves to addressing the AIDS crisis here in the United States with a strong national strategy of education, prevention and treatment, focusing on those communities at greatest risk. This strategy must be based on the best available science and built on the foundation of a strong health care system.\nBut in the end this epidemic can't be stopped by government alone, and money alone is not the answer, either. All of us must do our part.\nThis year's slogan, \"Stop AIDS: Keep the Promise\" is a timely one. In the Apostle Paul's letter to the Corinthians, he asked \"if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?\" We as leaders must continue to sound that call and encourage others to see themselves as leaders in this fight. And we must reaffirm our own commitment to confront and defeat this disease once and for all.\nThank you for your extraordinary work that you do each and every day. I am humbled by your devotion to this cause and look forward to working with you and new partners in this effort in the years ahead. God bless you all.", "timestamp": "2008-12-01", "title": "Videotaped Remarks on World AIDS Day"}

To succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates all elements of American power: our military and diplomacy; our intelligence and law enforcement; our economy and the power of our moral example. The team that we have assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that. They share my pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purpose about America's role as a leader in the world,\" said President-elect Obama.\n\"It is an honor to be a part of this team, led by the President-elect -- a team that will see to it that America can lead the world not only by the example of our power, but also by the power of our example. I believe we have assembled a national security team that is poised to recapture the totality of America's strength,\" said Vice President-elect Biden.\nThe national security team members announced today are listed below:\nSenator Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State\nOver nearly four decades in public service, as an attorney, First Lady, Senator, and presidential candidate, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has become one of the nation's foremost champions for children and families and advocates for women's rights and human rights. During the Clinton Administration, she transformed the role of First Lady, fighting for universal health care and helping to lead successful bipartisan efforts to improve the adoption and foster care systems, reduce teen pregnancy, and provide health care to millions of children through the Children's Health Insurance Program. As a representative of the United States, she championed American interests as well as the rights of women and girls in more than eighty countries around the world. In November 2000, Senator Clinton became the first First Lady elected to public office and the first woman elected independently in New York State; she has since won reelection. In the Senate, she has continued to advocate for equal access to health care, education, and economic opportunity for women and girls around the world. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Clinton has fought for and secured in law improved health care for members of the National Guard and Reserves and worked to bring our troops home safely and responsibly from Iraq. She also serves as the only Senate member of the Transformation Advisory Group to the Joint Forces Command, working to modernize our military. And Senator Clinton has continued to fight for quality, affordable health care for every American, working to strengthen the Children's Health Insurance Program and expand the use of health information technology. Most recently, as a groundbreaking candidate for President of the United States, Senator Clinton became the first woman ever to win a presidential primary, receiving more than 18 million votes as an advocate for working families and a voice for millions of Americans who have felt invisible to their government.\nSecretary Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense\nDr. Robert M. Gates was sworn in on December 18th, 2006, as the 22nd Secretary of Defense. Before entering his present post, Secretary Gates was the President of Texas A&M University, the nation's seventh largest university. Prior to assuming the presidency of Texas A&M on August 1st, 2002, he served as Interim Dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M from 1999 to 2001. Secretary Gates served as Director of Central Intelligence from 1991 until 1993. Secretary Gates is the only career officer in CIA's history to rise from entry-level employee to Director. He served as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence from 1986 until 1989 and as Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser at the White House from January 20th, 1989, until November 6th, 1991, for President George H.W. Bush. Secretary Gates has been awarded the National Security Medal, the Presidential Citizens Medal, has twice received the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal, and has three times received CIA's highest award, the Distinguished Intelligence Medal. Secretary Gates received his bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary, his master's degree in history from Indiana University, and his doctorate in Russian and Soviet history from Georgetown University.\nEric Holder, Attorney General\nMr. Holder is a litigation partner at Covington & Burling LLP in Washington, DC. During his professional career, Mr. Holder has held a number of significant positions in government. Upon graduating from Columbia Law School, he moved to Washington, DC and joined the Department of Justice as part of the Attorney General's Honors Program. In 1988, Mr. Holder was nominated by President Reagan to become an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. He was confirmed by the Senate and his investiture occurred in October of that year. Over the next five years, Judge Holder presided over hundreds of civil and criminal trials and matters. In 1993, President Clinton nominated Mr. Holder to become the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. He was confirmed later that year and served as the head of the largest United States Attorneys office in the nation for nearly four years. In 1997, President Clinton appointed Mr. Holder to serve as Deputy Attorney General, the number two position in the United States Department of Justice. He became the first African-American to serve as Deputy Attorney General. Mr. Holder briefly served under President Bush as Acting Attorney General pending the confirmation of Attorney General John Ashcroft. Mr. Holder attended Columbia College, majored in American History, and graduated in 1973. Mr. Holder then attended Columbia Law School from which he graduated in 1976. While in law school, he clerked at the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund and the Department of Justice's Criminal Division.\nGovernor Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security\nNamed one of America's Top Five Governors by Time magazine and one of America's top women leaders by Newsweek, Janet Napolitano stands out as a leader in developing innovative solutions to some of our country's greatest challenges. As Governor of Arizona, she's fought for quality schools, affordable healthcare, sensible economic development, a safe homeland, a secure border, and a government that is run efficiently and responsibly. She led the successful effort to create a new grade level in public school by offering voluntary full day kindergarten to every Arizona family. She raised teacher pay, expanded access to health insurance, and saved seniors millions on prescription drugs. Her homeland security background is extensive: as U.S. Attorney for Arizona, Napolitano led the Arizona portion of the domestic terrorism investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing; as Attorney General, she helped write the law to break up human smuggling rings; and as Governor, she implemented the first state homeland security strategy in the nation and opened the first state counter-terrorism center. She is a leader in coordinating federal, state, local and bi-national homeland security efforts, having presided over large-scale disaster preparedness exercises to ensure well-crafted and functional emergency plans. Napolitano was the first governor to call for the National Guard to assist at the U.S. -- Mexico border at federal expense, and is a leading national voice for comprehensive immigration reform. The past chair of the National Governors Association -- the first woman in history to hold this position -- Janet Napolitano was re-elected in 2006 in a landslide victory as Arizona's 21st Governor. Prior to her election as Governor of Arizona, Napolitano served one term as Arizona Attorney General and four years as U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona.\nSusan Rice, Ambassador to the United Nations\nDr. Susan E. Rice served most recently as a Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to the Obama for America campaign while on leave from the Brookings Institution where she is a Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy and Global Economy and Development Programs. Rice currently serves on the Obama-Biden Transition Project Advisory Board. From 1997-2001, she was U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Prior to that, Rice served in the White House at the National Security Council as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for African Affairs and as Director for International Organizations and Peacekeeping. Rice was previously a management consultant at McKinsey and Company. She received her B.A. in History with Honors from Stanford University and her M.Phil. and D.Phil. (Ph.D.) degrees in International Relations from Oxford University, where she was a Rhodes Scholar.\nGeneral Jim Jones, USMC (Ret), National Security Advisor\nGeneral Jim Jones, USMC (Ret) is president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Chamber Institute for 21st Century Energy. From July 1999 to January 2003, Jones was the 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. After relinquishing command as Commandant, he assumed the positions of Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) and Commander of the United States European Command (COMUSEUCOM), positions he held until December 2006. During this final assignment, he encouraged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to regard global energy as a security issue and advocated that the alliance consider the defense of critical infrastructures as a 21st century collective security mission. Jones retired from active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps February 1st, 2007, after more than 40 years of service. In addition to having been awarded national and international military awards, Jones received a bachelor of science degree (1966) and an Honorary Doctorate of Letters (2002) from Georgetown University. In June 1985, he graduated from the National War College in Washington, D.C.\nStanding order at the press conference (L-R): General Jim Jones, USMC (Ret); Governor Janet Napolitano; Defense Secretary Robert Gates; Vice President-elect Joe Biden; President-elect Barack Obama; Senator Hillary Clinton; Eric Holder; Dr. Susan Rice\nSpeaking order at the press conference: President-elect Barack Obama, Senator Hillary Clinton, Secretary Robert Gates, Eric Holder, Governor Janet Napolitano, Dr. Susan Rice, General Jim Jones, USMC (Ret), Vice President-elect Joe Biden", "timestamp": "2008-12-01", "title": "Press Release: Key Members of Obama-Biden National Security Team Announced"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84937", "text": "Good morning, everybody. I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving.\nLast week, we announced our economic team which is working as we speak to craft an economic recovery program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy.\nToday, Vice President-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce our national security team. The national security challenges we face are just as great and just as urgent as our economic crisis. We are fighting two wars. Our old conflicts remain unresolved. And newly-asserted powers have put strains on the international system.\nThe spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril that the world's deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands. Our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet.\nAmerica must also be strong at home to be strong abroad. We need to provide education and opportunity to all our citizens so every American can compete with anyone anywhere. And our economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage, and our global leadership.\nThe common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century, our destiny is shared with the world's from our markets to our security. From our public health to our climate, we must act with that understanding that now more than ever, we have a stake in what happens across the globe. And as we learn so painfully on 9-11, terror cannot be contained by borders nor safely provided by oceans alone.\nLast week, we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of six Americans among nearly 200 victims in Mumbai.\nIn the world we seek, there is no place for those who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism. This weekend, I told Prime Minister Singh of India that Americans stand with the people of India in this dark time. And I am confident that India's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear it down.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: And so in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning, a new dawn of American leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century and to seize the opportunities embedded in these challenges.\nWe will strengthen our capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends. We will renew old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships. We will show the world once more that America is relentless in the defense of our people, steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world. Democracy and justice, opportunity and unyielding hope because American values are America's greatest export to the world.\nTo succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully using, balances, and integrates all elements of American power, our military, and diplomacy, our intelligence and law enforcement, our economy and the power of our moral example. The team that we've assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that.\nIn their past service and plans for the future, these men and women represent all of the those elements of American power and the very best of the American example. They've served in you uniform and as diplomats. They have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, and executives. They share my pragmatism about the use of power and my sense of purpose about America's role as a leader in the world.\nI have known Hillary Clinton as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and a tough campaign opponent. She possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic. I am proud that she will be our next secretary of state. She's an American of tremendous stature who will have my complete confidence, who know many of the world's leaders, who will command respect in every capital, and who will clearly have the ability to advance our interests around the world.\nHillary's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances. There's much to do from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and North Korea, to seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, to strengthening international institutions.\nI think no doubt that Hillary Clinton is the right person to lead our State Department and to work with me in tackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda. At a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars, I've asked Secretary Robert Gates to continue as secretary of defense. And I'm pleased that he's accepted. Two years ago, he took over the Pentagon at a difficult time. He restored accountability. He won the confidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform as well as their families.\nHe earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle for his pragmatism and competence. He knows that we need a sustainable national security strategy. And that includes a bipartisan consensus at home.\nAs I said throughout the campaign, I will be giving Secretary Gates and our military a new mission as soon as I take office — responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successful transition to Iraqi control.\nWe will ensure that we have the strategy and resources to succeed against Al Qaida and the Taliban. As Bob said not too long ago, Afghanistan is where the War on Terror began, and it is where it must end. Going forward, we will continue to make the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces to defeat the threats of the 21st century.\nEric Holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as attorney everyone from his first day on the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance. He has distinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a senior official. And he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement challenges we face from terrorism to counterintelligence, from white-collar crime to public corruption.\nEric also has the combination of toughness and independence that we need at the Justice Department. Let me be clear. The attorney general serves the American people. And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people, uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution.\nJanet Napolitano offers of the experience and executive skills we need in the next secretary of homeland security. She has spent her career protecting people as a U.S. attorney, an attorney general, and as the governor of Arizona. She understands the need for a Department of Homeland Security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks and respond to catastrophe be it manmade or natural.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Janet assumes this critical role having learned the lessons, some of them painful, of the last several years from 9-11 to Katrina. She insists on competence and accountability. She knows firsthand the need to have a partner in Washington that works well with state and local governments.\nShe understands as well as anyone the danger of an unsecure border. And she will be a leader who can reform a sprawling department while safeguarding our homeland.\nSusan Rice will take on the crucial task of serving as permanent representative of the United States to the United Nations. Susan has been a close and trusted adviser. As in previous administrations, the UN ambassador will serve as a member of my Cabinet and in integral member of my team.\nHer background as a scholar on the National Security Council and assistant secretary of state will serve our nation well at the United Nations. Susan knows the global challenges we face demand global institutions that work.\nShe shares my belief that the UN is an indispensable and imperfect forum. She will carry the message that our commitment to multi-lateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform.\nWe need the United Nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action against terror and proliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease.\nFinally, I am convinced that General James Jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilled national security adviser. Generations of Joneses have served heroically on the battlefield from the breech beaches of Tarawa in World War II to Fox Trot Ridge in Vietnam.\nJim's Silver Star is a proud part of that legacy. He will bring to the job the duel experience of serving in uniform and as a diplomat. He has commanded a platoon in battle, served as supreme allied commander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of peace in the Middle East.\nJim is focused on the threats of today and the future. He understands the connection between energy and natural security and has worked on the front lines of global instability from Kosovo to Northern Iraq to Afghanistan. He will advise me and work effectively to integrate our efforts across the government so that we are effectively using all elements of American power to defeat unconventional threats and promote our values.\nI am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for American national security. This morning, we met to discuss the situation in Mumbai and some of the challenges that we face in the months and years ahead.\nIn the coming weeks, I will be in close contact with these advisers who will be working with their counterparts in the Bush administration to make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. Given the range of threats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition, I hope that we can proceed swiftly for those natural security officials who demand confirmation.\nWe move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men and women protecting us on our frontlines, diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerous corners of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours, FBI agents in the field, cops on the beat, prosecutors in our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports.\nThese selfless Americans whose name are unknown to most of us, will form the backbone of our effort. If we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and promote our values.\nAnd as we move forward with respect for American's tradition of a bipartisan national security policy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keeping our nation and our people safe, we are not Republicans or Democrats. We are Americans. There's no monopoly of power of wisdom in either party.\nTogether, as one nation, as one people, we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them. Together, we will meet the challenges of the 21st century not with fear but with hope.\nNow, before I take questions, I'd like to invite my team to say a few words. And I'm going to start with my dear friend, Hillary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Mr. President-elect, thank you for this honor. If confirmed, I will give this assignment, your administration, and our country my all. I also want to thank my fellow New Yorkers who have, for eight years, given me the joy of a job I love with the opportunity to work on issues I care about deeply in a state that I cherish.\nAnd you've also helped prepare me well for this new role. After all, New Yorkers aren't afraid to speak their minds and do so in every language. Leaving the Senate is very difficult for me. But during the last few weeks, I thought often of our troops serving bravely under difficult circumstances in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\nI thought of those other Americans in our foreign and civil services working hard to promote and protect our interests around the world. And I thought of the daunting tasks ahead for our country. An economy that is reeling, a climate that is warming. And as we saw with the horrible events in Mumbai, threats that are relentless.\nThe fate of our nation and the future of our children will be forged in the crucible of these global challenges. America cannot solve these crises without the world, and the world cannot solve them without America.\nBy electing Barack Obama our next president, the American people have demanded not just a new direction at home but a new effort to renew America's standing in the world as a force for positive change. We know our security, our values, and our interests cannot be protected and advanced by force alone nor, indeed, by Americans.\nWe must pursue vigorous diplomacy using all the tools we can muster to build a future with more partners and fewer adversaries, more opportunities and fewer dangers for all who seek freedom, peace, and prosperity.\nAmerica is a place founded on the idea that everyone should have the right to live up to his or her God-given potential. And it is that same ideal that must guide America's purpose in the world today. And while we are determined to defend our freedoms and liberties at all costs, we also reach out to the world again seeking common cause and higher ground.\nAnd so I believe the best way to continue serving my country is to join President-elect Obama, Vice President-elect Biden, the leaders here, and the dedicated public servants of the State Department on behalf of our nation at this defining moment. President Kennedy one said that engaging the world to meet the threats we face was the greatest adventure of our century.\nWell, Mr. President-elect, I am proud to join you on what will be a difficult and exciting adventure in this new century. And may God bless you and all who serve with you and our great country.\nGATES: I am deeply honored that the president-elect has asked me to continue as secretary of defense. Mindful that we are engaged in two wars and face other serious challenges at home and around the world, and with a profound sense of personal responsibility to and for our men and women in uniform and their families, I must do my duty as they do theirs. How could I do otherwise?\nServing in this position for nearly two years, and especially the opportunity to lead our brave and dedicated soldiers, sailor, airmen, Marines, and defense civilians has been the most gratifying experience of my life. I am honored to continue to serve them and our country. And I will be honored to serve President-elect Obama.\nHOLDER: Thank you, President-elect Obama, for the honor that you have bestowed upon me. I look forward to working with you and the members of this national security team assembled here.\nThe Department of Justice plays a unique role on this team. It is incumbent those of us who lead the department to ensure not only that the nation is safe but also that our laws and traditions are respected. There is not a tangent between those two. We can and we must ensure that the American people remain secure and that the great constitutional guarantees that define us as a nation are truly valued.\nFor example, working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress, should I be confirmed, we look forward to actually structuring policies that are both protective and consistent with who we are as a nation.\nHOLDER: I also look forward to working with the men and women of the Department of Justice to revitalize the department's efforts in those areas where the department that's unique capabilities and responsibilities in keeping our people safe and ensuring fairness and in protecting our environment.\nThis president-elect and the team you see before you are prepared to meet the challenges that we will confront. From my experience at the Department of Justice, I know that we cannot be successful if we act alone. We must never forget that in many ways those in state and local law enforcement are our first line of detection and protection against those from foreign shores who would do us harm.\nWe will need to interact with our state and local partners in new innovative ways to help them solve the other issues that they confront on a daily basis. National security concerns are not defined only by the challenges created by terrorists abroad but also by criminals in our midst, whether they be criminals located on the street or in a board room.\nWe must forge new ties and reestablish old bonds with our state and local partners. There is much that needs to be done in this new century. I am confident that working with our president-elect, the people on this stage and the departments that they represent, those of both parties who I know and respect on Capitol Hill, we can keep our nation safe, strong, and respected.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Janet Napolitano, a great governor and an old friend.\nNAPOLITANO: Thank you, Eric.\nPresident-elect Obama, I am honored by your confidence in me and your support. Your message of change has resonated with the American people as has the clarity and the confidence of our vision of a United States that is safe, secure, and effective in the world and at home.\nThe team you have assembled faces the challenge of protecting our homeland with constant vigilance and relentless work to prevent terrorist attacks. It also will plan carefully and thorough so that our domestic response to all hazards is fast, sound, levelheaded, and effective. Americans deserve no less.\nTo achieve this high level of performance, it will be my job and the job of this team to hold ourselves and our agencies accountable, to coordinate fully across the spectrum of government agencies and to ensure that we work hand in hand with state and local governments to share information, secure our borders, and keep our country safe.\nWe are a nation that will be proud, prepared, and resilient. Thank you for the opportunity to serve. And I would be remiss if I did not also thank the wonderful people of Arizona. Like Hillary, it is difficult to leave one job for another, but one must go where one can best serve.\nIt's now my privilege to introduce to you the nominee to be it the ambassador of the United Nations, Susan Rice.\nRICE: Mr. President-elect, Mr. Vice President-elect, I am deeply honored and grateful for the opportunity to serve you and our great country as the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations. I look forward to working with this outstanding bipartisan national security team to implement your visionary agenda, to strengthen our security, and renew American's leadership in the world.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank my parents who taught me that no dream is too bold to embrace. My husband and our children, Jake and Maris, for their patience, love, and sacrifice.\nWith your election, Mr. President-elect, the American people have signaled to the world that our nation is on the path to change. Now, we must fulfill that promise by joining with others to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the 21st century to prevent conflict, to promote peace, combat terrorism, present the spread and use of nuclear weapons, tackle climate change, end genocide, fight poverty and disease.\nAll of these goals are vital to America's security but none can be accomplished by America alone. To enhance our common security, we must invest in our common humanity. And to do so, we need capable partners and far more effective international institutions.\nThe United Nations was, in major part, America's creation.\nRICE: Mr. President-elect, I share your commitment to rededicate ourselves to the organization and its mission. If confirmed, as U.N. ambassador, I will work constructively within the organization to help strengthen its capacities and achieve needed reforms.\nI can think of no more important time to represent the United States at the United Nations. Mr. President-elect, thank you for the confidence you've placed in me and for the opportunity to serve in this vital mission.\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce General James Jones.\nJONES: Mr. President-elect, Mr. Vice President-elect, members of this tremendous team assembled this morning, I'm deeply humbled to have been asked by the president-elect to serve as national security adviser especially during the challenging times we currently face.\nAnd Mr. President-elect, I deeply appreciate your mentions my family's contribution to our national security since 1939.\nAs has been previously mentioned, national security in the 21st century comprising a portfolio which includes all elements of our national power and influence working in coordination and harmony towards the desired goal of keeping our nation safe, helping to make our world a better place, and providing opportunity to live in peace and security for the generations to follow.\nI am deeply humbled and deeply appreciative of this great opportunity, and I am very proud now to introduce a man who will play a key role in making this come to pass, the vice president-elect, Joe Biden.\nBIDEN: Well, Mr. President, you've assembled quite a team. And I hope and believe that the American people will come to feel as I do that we brought together one of the most talented national security teams ever assembled. A team prepared to meet the serious challenges we face today and the emerging threats that will confront us tomorrow.\nI have worked with and admired each of the members of the team some as far as back in days, Jim, when you were a Marine liaison to the United States Senate. And so we have a — I have a long relationship, as the president does, and I do with each of these folks.\nAnd each has a clear understanding of the forces that are shaping this new century and the lives of our fellow Americans. As was mentioned earlier, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the emergence of China, India, Russia, Brazil, and the unifying Europe as major powers, the spread of lethal weapons to dangerous countries as well as dangerous groups, the shortage of — and scarcity of energy, water, and food, the impact of climate change, economic dislocations, persistent poverty. The technological revolution that sends people, ideas, and money around the planet as ever faster speeds. And, as was already mentioned, as we witnessed again last week with the terrible events in the India, the challenge to democratic nation states from radical ideologies.\nThat's just a short list of the forces that are shaping the 21st century. And it's been implied by all the comments thus far, no one country can control these forces. But more than any other country in the world, we have the ability to affect them if we use the totality of our strength.\nAnd bringing together Senator Clinton, Secretary Gates, Eric Holder, Governor Napolitano, Susan Rice, and General Jones, the president-elect has assembled a national security team that is poised, in my view, to recapture the totality of America's strength. Each member of this team shares the goals and the principles that the president-elect and I have attempted to advance.\nEach member shares our conviction that strength and wisdom must go hand in hand. Each member believes, as we do, that America's security is not a partisan issue. Witness the team. Each member understands that America's military might and economic strength must married to the power of our ideas and our ideals if we are to deal effectively with dealing with the forces of change, some of which I've mentioned, and if we're going keep this country we love so dearly prosperous and free.\nThese are extraordinary times. That's not in a flight of fancy or exaggeration. These are extraordinary times. We face extraordinary challenges.\nBIDEN: But I am, as the president-elect is, optimistic, absolutely optimistic that this team, with the president-elect at our helm, will see to it that America leads not only by the example of our power but by the power of our example.\nAnd now, President-elect Obama is prepared to take your questions. And, again, Mr. President-elect, congratulations on assembling what I believe will be a first-class team to lead us into this century.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: OK. Let's start with Liz.\nQ: (Inaudible)?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, first of all, I think it's important to reiterate that our condolences, our thoughts, and our prayers go out to the people of India, the families that have been affected, and, obviously, we're heartbroken by the deaths of the six Americans that were caught up in this tragedy.\nI've spoken to Prime Minister Singh and expressed these concerns to him. An investigation is taking place. I was briefed by Secretary Rice throughout the weekend. She's on her way to the region. We've sent FBI to help on the investigation.\nAnd this is one of those time where I have to reiterate there's one president at a time. We're going to be engaged in some very delicate diplomacy in the next several days and weeks. So I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment.\nBut what I can say unequivocally is that both myself and the team that stands beside me are absolutely committed to eliminating the threat of terrorism. And that is true wherever it is found. We cannot have — we cannot tolerate a world in which innocents are being killed by extremists based on twisted ideologies.\nAnd we're going to have to bring the full force of our power, not only military but also diplomatic, economic, and political, to deal with those threats not only to keep America safe but also to ensure that peace and prosperity with exist around the world.\nSo I will be monitoring the situation closely. Thus far, I think the administration has done what's needed in trying to get the details of the situation. And my expectation is that President Zardari of Pakistan, who has already said that he will fully cooperate with the investigation, will follow through with that commitment.\nAll right. Karen?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. You've selected a number of high profile people for your national secure team. How can you ensure that the staff that you are assembling is going to be a smoothly-functioning team of rivals and not a clash of rivals?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I think you heard Joe mention the fact that many of the people who are standing beside me are people who have worked together before, who have the utmost respect for each other. These are outstanding public servants and outstanding in their various fields of endeavor.\nThey would not have agreed to join my administration, and I would not have asked them to be part of this administration unless we shared a core vision of what's needed to keep the American people safe and to assure prosperity here at home and peace abroad.\nI think all of us here share the belief that we have to maintain the strongest military on the planet, that we have to support our troops and make sure that they are properly trained, properly equipped, that they are provided with a mission that allows them to succeed. All of us here also agree that the strength of our military has to be combined with the wisdom and force of our diplomacy and that we are going to be committed to rebuilding and strengthening alliances around the world to advance American interests and American security.\nAnd so in discussions with this entire team, what I am excited about is a consensus not only among those of us standing here today, but I think cross a broad section of the American people, that now is the time for us to regain American leadership in all its dimensions. And I am very confident that each of these individuals are not going to be leaving the outstanding work that they are currently doing if they weren't convinced that they could work as an effective team.\nOne last point I will make. I assembled this team because I'm a strong believer in strong personalities and strong opinions. I think that's how the best decisions are made. One of the dangers in the White House, based on my reading of history, is that you get wrapped up in group think and everybody agrees with everything and there's no discussion and there are no dissenting views. So I'm going to be welcoming a vigorous debate inside the White House.\nBut understand I will be setting policy as president. I will be responsible for the vision that this team carries out, and I expect them to implement that vision once decisions are made. So as Harry Truman said, the buck will stop with me. And nobody who's standing here, I think, would have agreed to join this administration unless they had confidence that, in fact, that vision was one that would help secure the American people and our interests.\nJake?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. During the campaign, you said that you thought the U.S. had a right to attack high-value terrorist targets in Pakistan if given actionable intelligence with or without the Pakistani government's permission. Two questions on that.\nOne, do you think India has that same right?\nAnd, two, regarding what Karen just said, some people up there on the stage took issue with your saying that. They have strong opinions about issues ranging from Pakistan to the surge. And while they're all committed to have a successful United States, what private assurances have they given you that they will be able to carry out your vision even when they strongly disagree with that vision as some of them have been able to do in the past?\nThank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think that sovereign nations, obviously, have a right to protect themselves. Beyond that, I don't want to comment on the specific situation that's taking place in South Asia right now. I think it is important for us to let the investigators do their jobs and make a determination in terms of who was responsible for carrying out these heinous acts.\nI can tell you that my administration will remain steadfast in support of India's efforts to catch the perpetrators of this terrible act and bring them to justice. And I expect that the world community will feel the same way.\nNow, in terms of my team and carrying out my vision and my policies, as I've said, during campaigns or during the course of election season, differences get magnified. I did not ask for assurances from these individuals that they would agree with me at all times. I think they understand and would not be joining this team unless they understood and were prepared to carry out the decisions that have been made by me after full discussion.\nAnd, you know, most of the people who are standing here are people who I've worked with, and on the broad core vision of where America needs to go, we are in almost complete agreement. There are going to be differences in tactics and different assessments and judgments made. That's what I expect. That's what I welcome. That's why I asked them to join the team.\nPeter Baker?\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nYou've talked about the importance just now of having different voices and robust debate within your administration. But, again, going back to the campaign, you were asked and talked about the qualifications of the — your now, your nominee for secretary of state. And you belittled her travels around the word, equating it to having teas with foreign leaders. And your new White House council said that her resume was grossly exaggerated when it came to foreign policy. I'm wondering whether you can talk about the evolution of your views of her credentials since the spring.\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I mean, I think — this is fun for the press to try to stir up whatever quotes were generated during the course of the campaign. No, I understand. And you're having fun.\nBut the — and there's nothing wrong with that. I'm not — I'm not faulting it. But, look, I think if you look at the statements that Hillary Clinton and I have made outside of the heat of a campaign, we share a view that America has to be safe and secure. And in order to do that...\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: ... the statements that Hillary Clinton and I have made outside of the heat of a campaign, we share a view that America has to be safe and secure. And in order to do that we have to combine military power with strength and diplomacy. And we have to build and forge stronger alliances around the world so that we're not carrying the burdens and these challenges by ourselves.\nI believe that there is no more effective advocate than Hillary Clinton for that well-rounded view of how we advance American interests. She has served on the Armed Services Committee in the Senate. She's knows world leaders around the world. I have it extensive discussions with her both pre-election and post-election about the strategic opportunities that exist out there to strengthen American's posture in the world.\nAnd I think she is going to be an outstanding secretary of state. And if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't have offered her the job. And if she didn't believe that I was equipped to lead this nation in such a difficult time, she would not have accepted.\nJohn McCormack. Where's John?  Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nYou're known as a pretty good storyteller. Can you tell us a little bit of a story about how Senator Clinton was selected for this job? Was there a seminal moment? How was the offered extended? Can you give us some detail on how it was accepted and kind of the negotiation process that was involved here?\nAnd, also, does Secretary Gates meet the requirement for a Republican on the Cabinet, or should we be looking for others as well?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, I mean, I didn't — I didn't — I didn't check his voter registration. Secretary Gates, meets the qualification of being an outstanding current secretary of defense and somebody who is doing everything he can every single day to make sure that our troops are properly equipped and trained and organized in order to succeed at their missions and that their families are cared for.\nSo I have complete confidence in Secretary Gates being able to carry out his tasks. And I think the point here is that I didn't going around checking people's political registration. What I was most concerned with was whether or not they can serve the interests of the American people.\nWith respect to Senator and soon-to-be, Secretary of State Clinton, it was not a light bulb moment. I have always admired Senator Clinton. We have worked together extensively in the Senate. I have always believed that she is tough and smart and disciplined and that she shares my core values and the core values of the American people.\nAnd so I was always interested after the primary was over in finding ways in which we could collaborate. After the election was over and I began to think about my team, it occurred to me that she could potentially be an outstanding secretary of state. I extended her the offer and she accepted.\nI know that's not as juicy a story as you were hoping for, but that's all you're going to get, John. Thanks.\nWhere's Dean? There you are. Hey, Dean.\nQ: Sir, do you still intend to withdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq in 16 months after inauguration? And did you discuss that — the possibility of that — with Secretary Gates, before selecting him?\nTHE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, keep in mind what I said during the campaign. And you were there most of the time.\nI said that I would remove our combat troops from Iraq in 16 months with the understanding that it might be necessary, likely to be necessary, to maintain a residual force to provide potential training, logistical support to protect our civilians in Iraq.\nThe SOFA that has been now passed by the Iraqi legislature points us in the right direction. It indicates we are now on a glide path to reduce our forces in Iraq. I will be meeting be not only Secretary Gates but the joint chiefs of staff and commanders on the ground to make a determination as to how we move that pace — how we proceed in that withdrawal process.\nI believe that 16 months is the right timeframe. But as I have said consistently, I will listen to the recommendations of my commanders. And my number one priority is making sure that our troops remain safe in this transition phase and that the Iraqi people are well served by a government that is taking on increased responsibility for its own security.\nIt is a sovereign nation. What this signals is a transition period in which our mission will be changing. We will have to remain vigilant in making sure that any terrorist elements that remain in Iraq do not become strengthened as a consequence of our drawdown. But it's also critical that we recognize that the situation in Afghanistan has been worsening. The situation in South Asia, as a whole, and the safe havens for terrorist that have been established there represent the single most important threat against the American people.\nAnd we're going to have to mobilize our resources and focus on attention on defeating Al Qaeda, bin Laden, and any other extremist groups that intend to target American citizens.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2008-12-01", "title": "Remarks in Chicago Announcing National Security Team"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84979", "text": "Good morning.\nNearly 150 years ago, in one of the darkest years of our nation's history, President Abraham Lincoln set aside the last Thursday in November as a day of Thanksgiving. America was split by Civil War. But Lincoln said in his first Thanksgiving decree that difficult times made it even more appropriate for our blessings to be -- and I quote -- \"gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people.\"\nThis week, the American people came together with family and friends to carry on this distinctly American tradition. We gave thanks for loved ones and for our lasting pride in our communities and our country. We took comfort in good memories while looking forward to the promise of change.\nBut this Thanksgiving also takes place at a time of great trial for our people.\nAcross the country, there were empty seats at the table, as brave Americans continue to serve in harm's way from the mountains of Afghanistan to the deserts of Iraq. We honor and give thanks for their sacrifice, and stand by the families who endure their absence with such dignity and resolve.\nAt home, we face an economic crisis of historic proportions. More and more Americans are worried about losing a job or making their mortgage payment. Workers are wondering if next month's paycheck will pay next month's bills. Retirees are watching their savings disappear, and students are struggling with the cost of tuition.\nIt's going to take bold and immediate action to confront this crisis. That's why I'm committed to forging a new beginning from the moment I take office as President of the United States. Earlier this week, I announced my economic team. This talented and dedicated group is already hard at work crafting an Economic Recovery Plan that will create or save 2.5 million new jobs, while making the investments we need to fuel long-term economic growth and stability.\nBut this Thanksgiving, we are reminded that the renewal of our economy won't come from policies and plans alone -- it will take the hard work, innovation, service, and strength of the American people.\nI have seen this strength firsthand over many months -- in workers who are ready to power new industries, and farmers and scientists who can tap new sources of energy; in teachers who stay late after school, and parents who put in that extra hour reading to their kids; in young Americans enlisting in a time of war, seniors who volunteer their time, and service programs that bring hope to the hopeless.\nIt is a testament to our national character that so many Americans took time out this Thanksgiving to help feed the hungry and care for the needy. On Wednesday, I visited a food bank at Saint Columbanus Parish in Chicago. There -- as in so many communities across America -- folks pitched in time and resources to give a lift to their neighbors in need. It is this spirit that binds us together as one American family -- the belief that we rise and fall as one people; that we want that American Dream not just for ourselves, but for each other.\nThat's the spirit we must summon as we make a new beginning for our nation. Times are tough. There are difficult months ahead. But we can renew our nation the same way that we have in the many years since Lincoln's first Thanksgiving: by coming together to overcome adversity; by reaching for -- and working for -- new horizons of opportunity for all Americans.\nSo this weekend -- with one heart, and one voice, the American people can give thanks that a new and brighter day is yet to come.", "timestamp": "2008-11-27", "title": "Thanksgiving Remarks by the President-Elect"}

Eisenhower to provide an independent voice on intelligence issues, the new Economic Recovery Advisory Board will be charged with offering independent, nonpartisan information, analysis, and advice to the President as he formulates and implements his plans for economic recovery. The Economic Recovery Advisory Board will provide regular briefings to the President, Vice President and their economic team. The Board will be established initially for a two-year term, after which the President will make a determination on whether to continue its existence based on its continued necessity.\n\"At this defining moment for our nation, the old ways of thinking and acting just won't do. They call for us to seek fresh thinking and bold new ideas from the leading minds across America. And they demand that as we chart a course to economic recovery, we ensure that our government -- your government -- is held accountable for delivering results. Today, I'm pleased to announce the formation of a new institution to help our economic team accomplish these goals,\" said President-elect Barack Obama.\nPaul Volcker, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979-87, will serve as Chair of the Board. Volcker is one of the world's foremost economic policy practitioners with vast experience in managing economic crises. He will bring a deep understanding of financial markets and the global nature of this economic crisis to bear in leading the Board's work. Austan Goolsbee will serve as Staff Director and Chief Economist of the Recovery Advisory Board and act as the primary liaison between the Board and the Administration. The President is also nominating Goolsbee to be one of the three Members of his Council of Economic Advisers.\nMembers of the Board will be drawn from among distinguished citizens outside the government who are qualified on the basis of achievement, experience, independence, and integrity. The Board will bring a diverse set of perspectives and voices from different parts of the country and different sectors of the economy to bear in the formulation and evaluation of economic policy. Additional members will be announced in the future.\nThe Board will meet regularly and provide advice directly to the President on the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs to jump-start economic growth, create jobs, raise wages and living standards, address the housing crisis, and stabilize financial markets. The Board will also focus on how the response to the short-run economic crisis is laying the groundwork for the reforms necessary for longer-run prosperity.\nThe economic appointees announced today:\nPaul Volcker, Chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board\nPaul Volcker has served under five presidents of both parties in a life committed to public service. He was chairman of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System from 1979 to 1987. Prior to that, he served as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs.

He has been a key economic adviser to the President-elect since 2004.\nThe President-elect's full statement is below.\nRemarks of President-elect Barack Obama Economic Recovery Advisory Board  November 26th, 2008  Chicago, IL\nGood morning.\nIt has become increasingly clear in recent months that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions. At this defining moment for our nation, the old ways of thinking and acting just won't do. We are called to seek fresh thinking and bold new ideas from the leading minds across America. And as we chart a course to economic recovery, we must ensure that our government -- your government -- is held accountable for delivering results.\nToday, I'm pleased to announce the formation of a new institution to help our economic team accomplish these goals: the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. This Board is modeled on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board created by President Eisenhower to provide rigorous analysis and vigorous oversight of our intelligence community by individuals outside of government -- individuals who would be candid and unsparing in their assessment. This new board will perform a similar function for my Administration as we formulate our economic policy.\nThe Board will be composed of distinguished individuals from diverse backgrounds outside of government -- from business, labor, academia and other areas -- who will bring to bear their wisdom and expertise on the formulation, implementation and evaluation of my Administration's economic recovery plan. The Board will report regularly to me, Vice President-elect Biden and our economic team as we seek to jump-start economic growth, create jobs, raise wages, address our housing crisis and stabilize our financial markets.\nThe reality is that sometimes policymaking in Washington can become too insular. The walls of the echo chamber can sometimes keep out fresh voices and new ways of thinking -- and those who serve in Washington don't always have a ground-level sense of which programs and policies are working for people, and which aren't. This board will provide that perspective to me and my Administration, with an infusion of ideas from across the country and from all sectors of our economy -- input that will be informed by members' first-hand observations of how our efforts are impacting the daily lives of our families.\nI'm pleased to announce that this Board will be chaired by one of the world's foremost economic policy experts, a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and one of my most trusted advisors, Paul Volcker.\nPaul has been by my side throughout this campaign, providing a deep understanding of financial markets, extensive experience managing economic crises, and keen insight into the global nature of this particular crisis. Paul has served under both Republicans and Democrats and is held in the highest esteem for his sound and independent judgment. He has a long and distinguished record of service to our nation, and I am pleased that he has answered the call to serve once again.\nI am also happy to announce that Austan Goolsbee, another one of my key economic advisors, has agreed to serve as Staff Director and Chief Economist of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board and act as the primary liaison between the Board and the Administration. I also plan to nominate Austan to serve as one of the three members of my Council of Economic Advisers.\nAustan is one of America's most promising economic minds, known for his path-breaking work on tax policy and industrial organization. He is one of the economic thinkers who has most shaped my own thinking on economic matters, and I look forward to continuing our close collaboration in the White House.\nI plan to announce the remaining members of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board in the coming weeks, and I look forward to their contributions to our urgent work to rebuild our economy and restore prosperity across America.\nThank you, and I'm now happy to take questions.", "timestamp": "2008-11-26", "title": "Press Release: President-Elect Barack Obama Establishes President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84947", "text": "Good morning.\nI speak to you today, mindful that we meet at a moment of great challenge for America, as our credit markets are stressed, and our families are struggling. But as difficult as these times are, I'm confident that we will rise to meet this challenge – if we're willing to band together and recognize that Wall Street cannot thrive so long as Main Street is struggling; if we're willing to summon a new spirit of ingenuity and determination; and if Americans of great intellect, broad experience, and good character are willing to serve in government at this hour of need.\nYesterday, I announced four such Americans to help lead the economic team that will advise me as we seek to climb out of this crisis. Today, Vice President-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce two other key members of our team – Peter Orszag as Director and Robert Nabors as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nBefore I explain why I selected these outstanding public servants, let me just say a word about the work I am asking them to undertake. As I said yesterday, the economic crisis we face demands that we invest immediately in a series of measures that will help save or create two and a half million jobs and put tax cuts in the pockets of the hard-pressed middle class. Many of those new jobs will come in areas such as energy independence, technology, and health care modernization that will strengthen our economy for the future.\nBut if we're going to make the investments we need, we must also be willing to shed the spending we don't. In these challenging times, when we are facing both rising deficits and a sinking economy, budget reform is not an option. It is an imperative. We cannot sustain a system that bleeds billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that have outlived their usefulness, or exist solely because of the power of a politician, lobbyist, or interest group. We simply cannot afford it.\nThis isn't about big government or small government. It's about building a smarter government that focuses on what works. That is why I will ask my team to think anew and act anew to meet our new challenges. We will go through our federal budget – page by page, line by line – eliminating those programs we don't need, and insisting that those we do operate in a sensible cost-effective way. Let me give you one example of what I'm talking about. There's a report today that from 2003 to 2006, millionaire farmers received $49 million in crop subsidies even though they were earning more than the $2.5 million cutoff for such subsidies. If this is true, it is a prime example of the kind of waste I intend to end as President.\nAnd we will also focus on one of the biggest, long-run challenges that our budget faces – namely, the rising cost of health care in both the public and private sectors. This is not just a challenge but also an opportunity to improve the health care that Americans rely on and to bring down the costs that taxpayers, businesses, and families have to pay.\nThat is what the OMB will do in my administration – it will not only help design a budget and manage its implementation, it will also help make sure that our government – your government – is more efficient and more effective at serving the American people.\nThere is no better person to help lead this effort as Director of the OMB than my friend Peter Orszag. Peter has been one of our nation's leading voices on budgetary issues. It is said that a nation's budget reflects its priorities. I believe that is true. And I know that Peter will bring to his work at the OMB a set of priorities that I – and the American people – share. Throughout his career, he has made significant contributions in our understanding of all the major economic challenges we are now confronting – from reducing medical costs to saving Social Security to fighting global climate change to helping put the dream of a college degree within reach for more students.\nAs Director of the Congressional Budget Office, he reenergized and reinvigorated the agency, while shifting its focus to confront the health care crisis that is not only a cause of so much suffering for so many families, but a rapidly growing portion of our budget and a drag on our entire economy.\nBut it is not simply Peter's past career that makes him qualified for his new appointment, it is his vision for the future. He believes, as I do, that even as we take steps to restore discipline to our budget, we must also take the steps right now that are necessary to solve our immediate crisis.\nPeter doesn't need a map to tell him where the bodies are buried in the federal budget. He knows what works and what doesn't, what is worthy of our precious tax dollars and what is not. Just because a program, a special interest tax break or corporate subsidy is tucked into this year's budget, does not mean it should survive the next. The old ways of Washington simply can't meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.\nAnd no one is more able or more qualified to assist Peter in this work as Deputy Director of the OMB than Robert Nabors. Rob will bring to this post experience in the executive branch, at the OMB, where he helped the Clinton administration achieve balanced budgets, as well as in the legislative branch, where he led the appropriations committee staff as a driving force for a responsible budget. Together with Peter, Rob will help steer our budget through Congress so that I can sign it into law.\nNow, let me be clear: these appointments and the appointments I announced yesterday are not the sum of my economic team. These appointees will work with those I have yet to announce – including the secretaries of Energy and Labor, Commerce and Health and Human Services and others in my administration – to design a recovery plan for both Wall Street and Main Street, and to put our economy on a path to long-term growth and prosperity.\nBecause at this moment, we must not only restore confidence in our markets. We must also restore the confidence of middle class families that their government is on their side – that it's working for them – on their behalf – to meet their families' needs. And that is exactly what I intend to do as President of the United States of America.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58748", "text": "Good morning.\nThe news this past week, including this morning's news about Citigroup, has made it even more clear that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions. Our financial markets are under stress. New home purchases in October were the lowest in half a century. Recently, more than half a million jobless claims were filed, the highest in eighteen years -- and if we do not act swiftly and boldly, most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year.\nWhile we can't underestimate the challenges we face, we also can't underestimate our capacity to overcome them -- to summon that spirit of determination and optimism that has always defined us, and move forward in a new direction to create new jobs, reform our financial system, and fuel long-term economic growth.\nWe know this won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight. We'll need to bring together the best minds in America to guide us -- and that is what I've sought to do in assembling my economic team. I've sought leaders who could offer both sound judgment and fresh thinking, both a depth of experience and a wealth of bold new ideas -- and most of all, who share my fundamental belief that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers; that in this country, we rise and fall as one nation, as one people.\nToday, Vice President-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce the nomination of four individuals who meet these criteria to lead our economic team: Timothy Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury; Lawrence Summers as the Director of our National Economic Council; Christina Romer as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors; and Melody Barnes as Director of the Domestic Policy Council.\nHaving served in senior roles at Treasury, the IMF and the New York Fed, Tim Geithner offers not just extensive experience shaping economic policy and managing financial markets, but an unparalleled understanding of our current economic crisis, in all of its depth, complexity and urgency. Tim will waste no time getting up to speed. He will start his first day on the job with a unique insight into the failures of today's markets -- and a clear vision of the steps we must take to revive them.\nThe reality is that the economic crisis we face is no longer just an American crisis, it is a global crisis -- and we will need to reach out to countries around the world to craft a global response. Tim's extensive international experience makes him uniquely suited for this work. Growing up partly in Africa and having lived and worked throughout Asia; having served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs -- one of many roles in the international arena; and having studied both Chinese and Japanese, Tim understands the language of today's international markets in more ways than one.\nTim has served with distinction under both Democrats and Republicans and has a long history of working comfortably, and as an honest broker, on both sides of the aisle. With stellar performances and outstanding results at every stage of his career, Tim has earned the confidence and respect of business, financial and community leaders; members of Congress; and political leaders around the world -- and I know he will do so once again as America's next Treasury Secretary, the chief economic spokesman for my Administration.\nLike Tim, Larry Summers also brings a singular combination of skill, intellect, and experience to the role he will play in our Administration.\nAs Under Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and then Secretary of the Treasury, Larry helped guide us through several major international financial crises -- and was a central architect of the policies that led to the longest economic expansion in American history, with record surpluses, rising family incomes and more than 20 million new jobs. He also championed a range of measures -- from tax credits to enhanced lending programs to consumer financial protections -- that greatly benefitted middle income families.\nAs a thought leader, Larry has urged us to confront the problems of income inequality and the middle class squeeze, consistently arguing that the key to a strong economy is a strong and growing middle class. This idea is the core of my own economic philosophy and will be the foundation for all of my economic policies.\nAnd as one of the great economic minds of our time, Larry has earned a global reputation for being able to cut to the heart of the most complex and novel policy challenges. With respect to both our current financial crisis, and other pressing economic issues of our time, his thinking, writing and speaking have set the terms of the debate. I am glad he will be by my side, playing the critical role of coordinating my Administration's economic policy in the White House -- and I will rely heavily on his advice as we navigate the uncharted waters of this economic crisis.\nAs one of the foremost experts on economic crises -- and how to solve them -- my next nominee, Christina Romer, will bring a critically needed perspective to her work as Chair of my Council of Economic Advisors.\nChristina is both a leading macroeconomist and a leading economic historian, perhaps best known for her work on America's recovery from the Great Depression and the robust economic expansion that followed. Since 2003, she has been co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research Monetary Economics program. She is also a member of the Bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee -- the body charged with officially determining when a recession has started and ended -- experience which will serve her well as she advises me on our current economic challenges.\nChristina has also done groundbreaking research on many of the topics our Administration will confront -- from tax policy to fighting recessions. And her clear-eyed, independent analyses have received praise from both conservative and liberal thinkers alike. I look forward to her wise counsel in the White House.\nFinally, we know that rebuilding our economy will require action on a wide array of policy matters -- from education and health care to energy and Social Security. Without sound policies in these areas, we can neither enjoy sustained economic growth nor realize our full potential as a people.\nSo I am pleased that Melody Barnes, one of the most respected policy experts in America, will be serving as Director of my Domestic Policy Council -- and that she will be working hand-in-hand with my economic policy team to chart a course to economic recovery. An integral part of that course will be health care reform -- and she will work closely with my Secretary of Health and Human Services on that issue.\nAs Executive Vice President for Policy at the Center for American Progress, Melody directed a network of policy experts dedicated to finding solutions for struggling middle class families. She also served as Chief Counsel to the great Senator Ted Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary Committee, working on issues ranging from crime to immigration to bankruptcy, and fighting tirelessly to protect civil rights, women's rights and religious freedom.\nMelody's brilliant legal mind -- and her long experience working to secure the liberties on which this nation was founded and secure opportunity for those left behind -- make her a perfect fit for DPC Director.\nI am grateful that Tim, Larry, Christina, and Melody have accepted my nomination, and I look forward to working closely with them in the months ahead. And that work starts today, because the truth is, we don't have a minute to waste.\nRight now, our economy is trapped in a vicious cycle: the turmoil on Wall Street means a new round of belt-tightening for families and businesses on Main Street -- and as folks produce less and consume less, that just deepens the problems in our financial markets. These extraordinary stresses on our financial system require extraordinary policy responses. And my Administration will honor the public commitments made by the current Administration to address this crisis.\nFurther, beyond any immediate actions we may take, we need a recovery plan for both Wall Street and Main Street -- a plan that stabilizes our financial system and gets credit flowing again, while at the same time addressing our growing foreclosure crisis, helping our struggling auto industry, and creating and saving 2.5 million jobs -- jobs rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizing our schools, and creating the clean energy infrastructure of the twenty-first century. Because at this moment, we must both restore confidence in our markets -- and restore the confidence of middle-class families, who find themselves working harder, earning less, and falling further and further behind.\nI have asked my economic team to develop recommendations for this plan, and to consult with Congress, the current Administration and the Federal Reserve on immediate economic developments over the next two months. I have requested that they brief me on these matters on a daily basis, and in the coming weeks, I will provide the American people and the incoming Congress with an overview of their initial recommendations. It is my hope that the new Congress will begin work on an aggressive economic recovery plan when they convene in early January so that our Administration can hit the ground running.\nWith our economy in distress, we cannot hesitate or delay. Our families cannot afford to keep on waiting and hoping for a solution. They cannot afford to watch another month of unpaid bills pile up, another semester of tuition slip out of reach, another month where instead of saving for retirement, they're dipping into their savings just to get by.\nAgain, this won't be easy. There are no shortcuts or quick fixes to this crisis, which has been many years in the making -- and the economy is likely to get worse before it gets better. Full recovery won't happen immediately. And to make the investments we need, we'll have to scour our federal budget, line-by-line, and make meaningful cuts and sacrifices as well -- something I'll be discussing further tomorrow.\nDespite all of this, I am hopeful about the future. I have full confidence in the wisdom and ingenuity of my economic team -- and in the hard work, courage and sacrifice of the American people. And most of all, I believe deeply in the resilient spirit of this nation. I know we can work our way out of this crisis because we've done it before. And I know we will succeed once again if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together, and that is exactly what I intend to do as President.\nThank you, and I'm now happy to take questions.", "timestamp": "2008-11-24", "title": "Remarks in Chicago Announcing Members of the Economic Team"}

Financial markets faced more turmoil. New home purchases in October were the lowest in half a century. 540,000 more jobless claims were filed last week, the highest in eighteen years. And we now risk falling into a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further.\nWhile I'm pleased that Congress passed a long-overdue extension of unemployment benefits this week, we must do more to put people back to work and get our economy moving again. We have now lost 1.2 million jobs this year, and if we don't act swiftly and boldly, most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year.\nThere are no quick or easy fixes to this crisis, which has been many years in the making, and it's likely to get worse before it gets better. But January 20th is our chance to begin anew – with a new direction, new ideas, and new reforms that will create jobs and fuel long-term economic growth.\nI have already directed my economic team to come up with an Economic Recovery Plan that will mean 2.5 million more jobs by January of 2011 – a plan big enough to meet the challenges we face that I intend to sign soon after taking office. We'll be working out the details in the weeks ahead, but it will be a two-year, nationwide effort to jumpstart job creation in America and lay the foundation for a strong and growing economy. We'll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizing schools that are failing our children, and building wind farms and solar panels; fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead.\nThese aren't just steps to pull ourselves out of this immediate crisis; these are the long-term investments in our economic future that have been ignored for far too long. And they represent an early down payment on the type of reform my Administration will bring to Washington – a government that spends wisely, focuses on what works, and puts the public interest ahead of the same special interests that have come to dominate our politics.\nI know that passing this plan won't be easy. I will need and seek support from Republicans and Democrats, and I'll be welcome to ideas and suggestions from both sides of the aisle.\nBut what is not negotiable is the need for immediate action. Right now, there are millions of mothers and fathers who are lying awake at night wondering if next week's paycheck will cover next month's bills. There are Americans showing up to work in the morning only to have cleared out their desks by the afternoon. Retirees are watching their life savings disappear and students are seeing their college dreams deferred. These Americans need help, and they need it now.\nThe survival of the American Dream for over two centuries is not only a testament to its enduring power, but to the great effort, sacrifice, and courage of the American people. It has thrived because in our darkest hours, we have risen above the smallness of our divisions to forge a path towards a new and brighter day. We have acted boldly, bravely, and above all, together. That is the chance our new beginning now offers us, and that is the challenge we must rise to in the days to come. It is time to act. As the next President of the United States, I will.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84875", "text": "Let me begin by thanking the bipartisan group of U.S. governors who convened this meeting.\nFew challenges facing America – and the world – are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear. Sea levels are rising. Coastlines are shrinking. We've seen record drought, spreading famine, and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season.\nClimate change and our dependence on foreign oil, if left unaddressed, will continue to weaken our economy and threaten our national security.\nI know many of you are working to confront this challenge. In particular, I want to commend Governor Sebelius, Governor Doyle, Governor Crist, Governor Blagojevich and your host, Governor Schwarzenegger – all of you have shown true leadership in the fight to combat global warming. And we've also seen a number of businesses doing their part by investing in clean energy technologies.\nBut too often, Washington has failed to show the same kind of leadership. That will change when I take office. My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process.\nThat will start with a federal cap and trade system. We will establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80% by 2050.\nFurther, we will invest $15 billion each year to catalyze private sector efforts to build a clean energy future. We will invest in solar power, wind power, and next-generation biofuels. We will tap nuclear power, while making sure it's safe. And we will develop clean coal technologies.\nThis investment will not only help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil, making the United States more secure. And it will not only help us bring about a clean energy future, saving our planet. It will also help us transform our industries and steer our country out of this economic crisis by generating five million new green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.\nBut the truth is, the United States cannot meet this challenge alone. Solving this problem will require all of us working together. I understand that your meeting is being attended by government officials from over a dozen countries, including the UK, Canada and Mexico, Brazil and Chile, Poland and Australia, India and Indonesia. And I look forward to working with all nations to meet this challenge in the coming years.\nLet me also say a special word to the delegates from around the world who will gather at Poland next month: your work is vital to the planet. While I won't be President at the time of your meeting and while the United States has only one President at a time, I've asked Members of Congress who are attending the conference as observers to report back to me on what they learn there.\nAnd once I take office, you can be sure that the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations, and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change.\nNow is the time to confront this challenge once and for all. Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high. The consequences, too serious. Stopping climate change won't be easy. It won't happen overnight. But I promise you this: When I am President, any governor who's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House. Any company that's willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in Washington. And any nation that's willing to join the cause of combating climate change will have an ally in the United States of America.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84848", "text": "Today, I am ending one journey to begin another. After serving the people of Illinois in the United States Senate -- one of the highest honors and privileges of my life -- I am stepping down as senator to prepare for the responsibilities I will assume as our nation's next president. But I will never forget, and will forever be grateful, to the men and women of this great state who made my life in public service possible.\nMore than two decades ago, I arrived in Illinois as a young man eager to do my part in building a better America. On the South Side of Chicago, I worked with families who had lost jobs and lost hope when the local steel plant closed. It wasn't easy, but we slowly rebuilt those neighborhoods one block at a time, and in the process I received the best education I ever had. It's an education that led me to organize a voter registration project in Chicago, stand up for the rights of Illinois families as an attorney and eventually run for the Illinois state Senate.\nIt was in Springfield, in the heartland of America, where I saw all that is America converge -- farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard. It was there that I learned to disagree without being disagreeable; to seek compromise while holding fast to those principles that can never be compromised, and to always assume the best in people instead of the worst. Later, when I made the decision to run for the United States Senate, the core decency and generosity of the American people is exactly what I saw as I traveled across our great state -- from Chicago to Cairo; from Decatur to Quincy.\nI still remember the young woman in East St. Louis who had the grades, the drive and the will but not the money to go to college. I remember the young men and women I met at VFW halls across the state who serve our nation bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I will never forget the workers in Galesburg who faced the closing of a plant they had given their lives to, who wondered how they would provide health care to their sick children with no job and little savings.\nStories like these are why I came to Illinois all those years ago, and they will stay with me when I go to the White House in January. The challenges we face as a nation are now more numerous and difficult than when I first arrived in Chicago, but I have no doubt that we can meet them. For throughout my years in Illinois, I have heard hope as often as I have heard heartache. Where I have seen struggle, I have seen great strength. And in a state as broad and diverse in background and belief as any in our nation, I have found a spirit of unity and purpose that can steer us through the most troubled waters.\nIt was long ago that another son of Illinois left for Washington. A greater man who spoke to a nation far more divided, Abraham Lincoln, said of his home, \"To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.\" Today, I feel the same, and like Lincoln, I ask for your support, your prayers, and for us to \"confidently hope that all will yet be well.\" With your help, along with the service and sacrifice of Americans across the nation who are hungry for change and ready to bring it about, I have faith that all will in fact be well. And it is with that faith, and the high hopes I have for the enduring power of the American idea, that I offer the people of my beloved home a very affectionate thanks.", "timestamp": "2008-11-16", "title": "Letter to the People of Illinois Announcing Resignation from the United States Senate"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84849", "text": "Steve Kroft: So here we are.\nThe President-Elect: Here we are.\nKroft: How's your life changed in the last ten days?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I tell you what, there seem to be more people hovering around me. That's for sure. And, on the other hand, I'm sleeping in my own bed over the last ten days, which is quite a treat. Michelle always wakes up earlier than I do. So listen to her roaming around and having the girls come in and, you know, jump in your bed. It's a great feeling. Yeah.\nKroft: Has this been easier than the campaign trail?\nThe President-Elect: Well, it's different. I think that during the campaign it is just a constant frenetic, forward momentum. Here, I'm stationary. But the issues come to you. And we've got a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of problems, a lot of big challenges.\nKroft: Have there been moments when you've said, 'What did I get myself into?'\nThe President-Elect: Surprisingly enough, I feel right now that I'm doing what I should be doing. That gives me a certain sense of calm. I will say that the challenges that we're confronting are enormous. And they're multiple. And so there are times during the course of a given a day where you think, 'Where do I start?'\nKroft: What have you been concentrating on this week?\nThe President-Elect: Couple of things. Number one, I think it's important to get a national security team in place because transition periods are potentially times of vulnerability to a terrorist attack. We wanna make sure that there is as seamless a transition on national security as possible. Obviously the economy. Talking to top economic advisors about how we're gonna create jobs, how we get the economy back on track and what do we do in terms of some long-term issues like energy and healthcare. And how do we sequence those things in a way that we can actually get things through Congress?\nKroft: Are you in sync with Secretary Paulson in terms of how the $700 billion is being used?\nThe President-Elect: Well, look, Hank Paulson has worked tirelessly under some very difficult circumstances. We've got an unprecedented crisis, or at least something that we have not seen since the Great Depression. And I think Hank would be the first one to acknowledge that probably not everything that's been done has worked the way he had hoped it would work. But I'm less interested in looking backwards than I am in looking forwards.\nKroft: The government has spent almost $300 billion out of the TARP program.\nThe President-Elect: Right.\nKroft: Money that was set aside to help the financial industry. And nothing much has changed if you look at it. Nothing much has changed. ItвЂ™s $300 billion. Why is that?\nThe President-Elect: I think the part of the way to think about it is things could be worse. I mean, we could have seen a lot more bank failures over the last several months. We could have seen an even more rapid deterioration of the economy, even a bigger drop in the stock market. So part of what we have to measure against is what didn't happen and not just what has happened.\nHaving said that, there's no doubt that we have not been able yet to reset the confidence in the financial markets and in the consumer markets and among businesses that allow the economy to move forward in a strong way. And my job as president is gonna be to make sure that we restore that confidence.\nKroft: Once you become president, are there things that you'll change?\nThe President-Elect: Well, you know I think we still have to see how this thing unfolds over the next couple of months. One area that I'm concerned about, and I've said this publicly, is we have not focused on foreclosures and what's happening to homeowners as much as I would like. We have the tools to do it. We've gotta set up a negotiation between banks and borrowers so that people can stay in their homes. That is gonna have an impact on the economy as a whole. And, you know, one thing I'm determined is that if we don't have a clear focused program for homeowners by the time I take office, we will after I take office.\nKroft: Are you being consulted by Secretary Paulson?\nIs he telling you what's going on?\nThe President-Elect: You know what we've done is we've assigned somebody on my transition team who interacts with him on a daily basis. And, you know, we are getting the information that's required to and we're making suggestions in some circumstances about how we think they might approach some of these problems.\nKroft: Are they listening?\nThe President-Elect: Well, you know, that we'll find out.\nKroft: People are comparing this to 1932.\nThe President-Elect: Right.\nKroft:Is that a valid comparison, do you think?\nThe President-Elect: Well, keep in mind that 1932, 1933 the unemployment rate was 25 percent, inching up to 30 percent. You had a third of the country that was ill housed, ill clothed, unemployed. We're not going through something comparable to that. But I would say that this is as bad as we've seen since then. And if we don't take some significant steps then it could get worse.\nKroft: You have a situation right now where you have General Motors, which is in dire straits.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah.\nKroft: May run out of cash by the end of the year, maybe by the end of certainly, if we believe what we read in the papers, by the time you take office.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah. Well, let's see how this thing plays itself out. For the auto industry to completely collapse would be a disaster in this kind of environment, not just for individual families but the repercussions across the economy would be dire. So it's my belief that we need to provide assistance to the auto industry. But I think that it can't be a blank check.\nSo my hope is that over the course of the next week, between the White House and Congress, the discussions are shaped around providing assistance but making sure that that assistance is conditioned on labor, management, suppliers, lenders, all the stakeholders coming together with a plan what does a sustainable U.S. auto industry look like? So that we are creating a bridge loan to somewhere as opposed to a bridge loan to nowhere. And that's, I think, what you haven't yet seen. That's something that I think we're gonna have to come up with.\nKroft: Are there a lot of people that think that the country would probably be better off and General Motors might be better off if it was allowed to go into bankruptcy?\nThe President-Elect: Well, you know, under normal circumstances that might be the case in the sense that you'd go to a restructuring like the airlines had to do in some cases. And then they come out and they're still a viable operation. And they're operating even during the course of bankruptcy. In this situation, you could see the spigot completely shut off so that it would not potentially permit GM to get back on its feet. And I think that what we have to do is to recognize that these are extraordinary circumstances. Banks aren't lending as it is. They're not even lending to businesses that are doing well, much less businesses that are doing poorly. And in that circumstance, the usual options may not be available.\nKroft: When the price of oil was at $147 a barrel, there were a lot of spirited and profitable discussions that were held on energy independence. Now you've got the price of oil under $60.\nThe President-Elect: Right.\nKroft: Does doing something about energy is it less important now thanвЂ¦\nMr. Obama: It's more important. It may be a little harder politically, but it's more important.\nKroft: Why?\nThe President-Elect: Well, because this has been our pattern. We go from shock to trance. You know, oil prices go up, gas prices at the pump go up, everybody goes into a flurry of activity. And then the prices go back down and suddenly we act like it's not important, and we start, you know filling up our SUVs again.\nAnd, as a consequence, we never make any progress. ItвЂ™s part of the addiction, all right. That has to be broken. Now is the time to break it.\nKroft: Where is all the money going to come from to do all of these things? And is there a point where just going to the Treasury Department and printing more of it ceases to be an option?\nThe President-Elect: Well, look, I think what's interesting about the time that we're in right now is that you actually have a consensus among conservative Republican-leaning economists and liberal left-leaning economists. And the consensus is this: that we have to do whatever it takes to get this economy moving again, that we're gonna have to spend money now to stimulate the economy.\nAnd that we shouldn't worry about the deficit next year or even the year after. That short term, the most important thing is that we avoid a deepening recession.\nKroft: How high a priority are you placing on re-regulation of the financial markets?\nThe President-Elect: I think it's a top priority. I think that we have to restore a sense of trust, transparency, openness in our financial system. And keep in mind that the deregulation process, it wasn't just one party. I think there's a lot of blame to spread around.\nBut, hopefully, everybody's learned their lesson. And the answer is not heavy-handed regulations that crush the entrepreneurial spirit and risk taking of American capitalism. That's what's made our economy great. But it is to restore a sense of balance.\nHis first legislative goal will be to get Congress to pass an economic stimulus package that he hopes will create jobs and put money in the pockets of ordinary citizens, construction programs to shore up the nation's creaky infrastructure, a tax cut for the middle class and his first initiatives on health care. But some things he can do with the stroke of a pen.\nKroft: There are a number of different things that you could do early pertaining to executive orders. One of them is to shutdown Guantanamo Bay. Another is to change interrogation methods that are used by U.S. troops. Are those things that you plan to take early action on?\nThe President-Elect: Yes. I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that. I have said repeatedly that America doesn't torture. And I'm gonna make sure that we don't torture. Those are part and parcel of an effort to regain America's moral stature in the world.\nKroft: Can you give us some sense of when you might start redeployments out of Iraq?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I've said during the campaign, and I've stuck to this commitment, that as soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, my national security apparatus, and we will start executing a plan that draws down our troops. Particularly in light of the problems that we're having in Afghanistan, which has continued to worsen. We've got to shore up those efforts.\nKroft: Where does capturing or killing Osama bin Laden fall?\nThe President-Elect: I think it is a top priority for us to stamp out al Qaeda once and for all. And I think capturing or killing bin Laden is a critical aspect of stamping out al Qaeda. He is not just a symbol, he's also the operational leader of an organization that is planning attacks against US targets.\nKroft: How close are you to settling on a cabinet?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I think that I've got a pretty good idea of what I'd like to see. But it takes some time to work those things through.\nKroft: When are you gonna make your first announcement?\nThe President-Elect: Soon.\nKroft: Next week?\nThe President-Elect: Soon.\nKroft: You met with Senator Clinton this week.\nThe President-Elect: I did.\nKroft: Is she on the short list for a cabinet position?\nThe President-Elect: You know, she is somebody who I needed advice and counsel from. She is one of the most thoughtful public officials that we have. Beyond that, you're not getting anything out of me Steve.\nKroft: Will there be Republicans in the cabinet?\nThe President-Elect: Yes.\nKroft: More than one?\nThe President-Elect: You're not getting more out of me.\nKroft: You've spoken to some former presidents.\nThe President-Elect: I have.\nKroft: Any advice, any good advice they gave you?\nThe President-Elect: You know, they were all incredibly gracious. But I think that all of them recognized that there's a certain loneliness to the job. That, you know, you'll get advice, and you'll get counsel. Ultimately, you're the person who's gonna be making decisions.\nAnd I think that even now, you know, I - you can already feel that fact.\nKroft: What are you reading right now? I mean, haveвЂ¦\nThe President-Elect: A lot of briefing papers.\nKroft: A lot of briefing papers?\nThe President-Elect: Yeah. I've been spending a lot of time reading Lincoln. There is a wisdom there and a humility about his approach to government, even before he was president, that I just find very helpful.\nKroft: Put a lot of his political enemies in his cabinet.\nThe President-Elect: He did.\nKroft: Is that something you're considering?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I tell you what, I find him a very wise man.\nKroft: Have you been reading anything about the Depression? Anything about FDR?\nThe President-Elect: You know, I have actually. There's a new book out about FDR's first 100 days and what you see in FDR that I hope my team can-- emulate, is not always getting it right, but projecting a sense of confidence, and a willingness to try things. And experiment in order to get people working again.\nAnd I think that's what the American people expect. You know, they're not expecting miracles. I think if you talk to the average person right now that they would say, 'Well, look, you know well, we're having a tough time right now. We've had tough times before.' 'And you know, we don't expect a new president can snap his fingers and suddenly everything is gonna be okay. But what we do expect is that the guy is gonna be straight with us. We do expect that he's gonna be working really hard for us.'\n'We do expect that he's gonna be thinking about ordinary Americans and not just the wealthy and the powerful. And we do expect that. if something doesn't work that they're gonna try something else until they find something that does.' And, you know, that's the kind of common sense approach that I want to take when I take office.\nKroft: There's been talk on Capitol Hill and a number of Democratic congressmen have proposed programs that are part of sort of a new New Deal. The possibility of reviving agencies like the Home Ownership Loan Corporation.\nThe President-Elect: Two points I'd make on this. Number one, although there are some parallels to the problems that we're seeing now and what we say back in the '30s, no period is exactly the same. For us to simply recreate what existed back in the '30s in the 21st century, I think would be missing the boat. We've gotta come up with solutions that are true to our times and true to this moment. And that's gonna be our job. I think the basic principle that government has a role to play in kick starting an economy that has ground to a halt is sound.\nI think our basic principle that this is a free market system and that that has worked for us, that it creates innovation and risk taking, I think that's a principle that we've gotta hold to as well. But what I don't wanna do is get bottled up in a lot of ideology and is this conservative or liberal. My interest is finding something that works.\nAnd whether it's coming from FDR or it's coming from Ronald Reagan, if the idea is right for the times then we're gonna apply it. And things that don't work we're gonna get rid of.\nKroft: Are you gonna make a lot of speeches? Are you gonna talk a lot to the American people on television and radio?\nThe President-Elect: You know, I'm not sure that the American people are looking for a lot of speeches. I think what they're looking for is action. But one of the things that I do think is important is to be able to explain to the American people what you're doing, and why you're doing it. That is something that I think every great president has been able to do. From FDR to Lincoln to John Kennedy to Eisenhower. I mean, I think that they were people who were able to say 'Here's the direction we're going. Here's why I think it's important. Here are the possible dangers or challenges. But ultimately, you know, this is gonna lead us to a better America.' And I want to make sure that I can recreate a bond of trust between the presidency and the public that I think has been lost.\nSteve Kroft: When was the first moment that it began to sink in that you were President of the United States? Do you remember?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I'm not sure it's sunk in yet.\nMrs. Obama: I guess I'm sort of like him. I'm not sure if it has really sunk in. But I remember, we were watching the returns and, on one of the stations, Barack's picture came up and it said, 'President-Elect Barack Obama. ' And I looked at him and I said, 'You are the 44th President of the United States of America. Wow. What a country we live in.'\nThe President-Elect: How about that?\nMrs. Obama: Yeah.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah. Yeah. And then she said 'Are you gonna take the girls to school in the morning?'\nMrs. Obama: I did not. I didn't say that.\nThe President-Elect: It wasn't at that moment.\nKroft: You made the address in Grant Park. And you brought the kids out. And, at some point you whispered something. Can you remember that?\nMrs. Obama: I said, 'Wow, Look at this.'\nThe President-Elect: How 'bout that?\nMrs. Obama: I told him, 'Good job. Well done.' To walk out there and see hundreds of thousands of hard working folks, because so many people put their energy and their hopes into this campaign. To see the outcome and the emotion, it was a very emotional evening because I think people were ready to take hold of this country and help move it in a different direction and you felt that.\nKroft: The emotion of that night was fueled, in part, by the fact that you were first African-American ever elected. Did you feel that?\nThe President-Elect: There's no doubt that there was a sense of emotion that I could see in people's faces and in my mother-in-law's face. You know, I mean, you think about Michelle's mom, who grew up on the west and south sides of Chicago, who worked so hard to help Michelle get to where she is, her brother to be successful. She was sitting next to me, actually, as we were watching returns. And she's like my grandmother was, sort of a no-fuss type of person. And suddenly she just kind of reached out and she started holding my hand, you know, kind of squeezing it. And you had this sense of, 'Well, what's she thinking?' For a black woman who grew up in the 50s, you know, in a segregated Chicago, to watch her daughter become first lady of the United States. I think there was that sense across the country. And not unique to African-Americans. I think that.\nMrs. Obama: That's right.\nThe President-Elect: I think people felt that it was a sign of the enormous progress that we've made in the core decency and generosity of the American people. Which isn't to say that there were a number of reasons that somebody might not have voted for me. But what was absolutely clear was is that whether people voted for me or against me, that they were making the judgment based on is this guy gonna, you know, lead us well? Is this guy gonna be a good president? And that was my assumption walking in. And that's how it turned out. And that felt good.\nKroft: What was your conversation like the next morning at the breakfast table with the kids.\nMrs. Obama: Yeah, everyone was tired.\nThe President-Elect: Because they had been up until midnight.\nMrs. Obama: They had been up. But we got up and went to school. But we went to school late. Barack, you slept in. You know, so I think we were just back into the routine. Our hopes are to just to keep the girls moving. It's like okay , Daddy's president-elect, okay, we can get to school by 10. And we got to the school and the folks at the school were excited. Some people were cheering as I walked the kids to the class. And I remember Malia saying, 'That's embarrassing.' But you know, it was a pretty normal day for us.\nAnd there have not been many of those. The past two years were spent on the campaign trail and before that Senator Obama split his time between their home in Chicago where Michelle and the girls lived, and a very modest apartment in Washington, which nearly burned down.\nKroft: So, you've given up the apartment in Washington that you stayed in?\nThe President-Elect: I used to get teased, not just by Michelle, but by my own staff. They'd say, 'You know, you're the only senator that has a worse apartment than your 25-year-old staff people.' Eventually, I think, Secret Service kind of looked at me like, you know, once the building caught fire, and the ceiling caved in, I saidвЂ¦\nMrs. Obama: But he moved back in anyway.\nThe President-Elect: For a while.\nMrs. Obama: After the fire.\nThe President-Elect: Shortly.\nKroft: Did you ever stay there?\nMrs. Obama: I visited, but I didn't sleep there.\nThe President-Elect: She insisted on a hotel room.\nMrs. Obama: I saw it. I saw it long enough to know that I wasn't gonna stay there.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah\nKroft: It is one bedroom? Studio?\nThe President-Elect: Yeah, it was sort of a one bedroom. It had kind of the vintage, college dorm, pizzaвЂ¦\nKroft: Community organizer, right?, feel to it.\nMrs. Obama: It reminded me of a little better version of the apartment you were in when we first started dating. That was a dump too.\nThe President-Elect: Right near Harold's Chicken Shack.\nMrs. Obama:Yeah.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah. That's when I had the car with the-the hole in it.\nMrs. Obama: And you could see the sidewalk, because the rust had gone through.\nThe President-Elect: The air-conditioning.\nMrs. Obama: So that was my side. I would look and see the ground going past. And I still married him.\nThe President-Elect: That's how I knew she loved me. It wasn't for my money.\nThey got their first look at their new home last Monday, when the President and Laura Bush invited the Obamas to the White House, which has 130 more rooms than that old Washington apartment.\nKroft: What was it like going through there?\nMrs. Obama: Well, first of all, Laura Bush was just so gracious. She is a really sweet person. And couldn't have been more excited and enthusiastic about the tour. So that was wonderful. And her entire team, their team has been working closely just to make us feel welcome. But the White House is beautiful. It is awe-inspiring. It is. What I felt walking through there was that it is a great gift and an honor to be able to live here. And you know we want to make sure that we're upholding what that house stands for. But I couldn't help but envisioning the girls running into their rooms and, you know, running down the hall and with a dog. And, you know, you start picturing your life there. And our hope is that the White House will feel open and fun and full of life and energy.\nThe President-Elect: Sleepovers.\nMrs. Obama: And sleepovers.\nKroft: I know that from talking to you, you've said that this has put a lot of, you know, your husbandвЂ™s involvement in politics has put strains in your marriage from time to time. He's about to take over the most pressure packed job in the world. But he's also gonna be home, right?\nMrs. Obama: Oh yeah. He's got a big office at home now.\nYou know, this entire year and a half has brought us closer together as a family. And we managed to stay close and become even closer with Barack gone most of an entire two year period. And now we get to be together under the one roof, having dinners together. And, you know, I envision the kids coming home from school and being able to run across the way to the Oval Office and see their dad before they start their homework. And having breakfast. And he'll be there to tuck them in at night. And, you know, again, you know, there'll be moments of deep seriousness and times of great focus. But, you know, we'll be together doing that. And that gives me reason to be very excited.\n[But that's not the only thing that is about to change for the Obamas. When 60 Minutes first met them two years ago in Chicago, everything was much simpler.]\nKroft: I can remember the first time we went to your house We were greeted at the door by the girls. They were a little smaller then. A couple years younger. But that has to have changed. I mean, you can't get in the car and drive all over Chicago, right?\nThe President-Elect: Yeah. I remember the first time we interviewed - we just drove down right near your momвЂ™s house.\nMrs. Obama: Oh, that's right. That's right. You did.\nThe President-Elect: Got out of the car, walked--\nThe President-Elect: Yeah, that's a little harder to do now.\nKroft: You told me that when you went off to Washington and made the decision to live there and when you came back to Chicago you had certain chores that you had to perform. You had to wash the dishes and make your bed.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah.\nKroft: Are you free now on that front?\nThe President-Elect: Well, IвЂ¦\nKroft: Certainly there's gonna be somebody else to wash the dishes and make your bed.\nMrs. Obama: Yes.\nThe President-Elect: There sometimes it's soothing to wash the dishes.\nMrs. Obama: You? Since when was it ever soothing for you to wash the dishes?\nThe President-Elect: You know, when I had to do it. I'd make it into a soothing thing.\nMrs. Obama: The thing you have to remember, Steve, is that you, the interesting part about this year is that it is slowly transitioned us into this. So today doesn't feel as normal as it did yesterday. If we had compared it to the January before he announced, it would seem truly odd. But we have gradually, you know, had more and more changes. And I think, for us, that's helped us get adjusted to do it. So today isn't a shock.\nThe President-Elect: One of the great joys of this campaign is the seeing how the girls have adjusted to this thing. They have stayed their normal, cheerful, happy, courteous, curious selves. And that was one of my biggest worries. And remains one of my biggest worries. You know, when we think about, I know Michelle and I have talked about this a lot. How do we just maintain that precious normalcy in our two girls? And, you know, 'cause right now they're not self-conscious. They're. you know, they don't have an attitude. And I think one of our highest priorities, over the next four years, is retaining that. If at the end of four years, just from a personal standpoint, we can say they are who they are. They remain the great joys that they are. And this hasn't, you know, created a whole bunch of problems for them. Then I think we're gonna feel pretty good.\nKroft: How has your life changed in the last ten days?\nMrs. Obama: You know, it's calmed down a bit. I mean, we're-- we're back into more of a routine.\nThe President-Elect: There's still some things we're not adjusted to.\nMrs. Obama: Like what?\nThe President-Elect: Like--\nMrs. Obama: What do you want?\nThe President-Elect: Me not being able to take a walk.\nMrs. Obama: Oh, well, you know.\nThe President-Elect: No, I mean, though those are things thatвЂ¦\nMrs. Obama: I don't walk as much as he does though. So I guess I don't miss it.\nThe President-Elect: Yeah. I mean, you know.\nMrs. Obama: You want to go for a walk?\nThe President-Elect: I do. I'd love to take you for a walk. Although it's cold today. ButвЂ¦\nMrs. Obama: Yeah, I wouldn't go with you.\nThe President-Elect: I know. Well, that's something that I don't think I'll ever get used to. I mean, the loss of anonymity and this is not a complaint, this is part of what you sign up for. Being able to just wander around the neighborhood. I can't go to my old barber shop now. I've gotta have my barber come to some undisclosed location to cut my hair. You know, the small routines of life that keep you connected I think - some of those are being lost. One of the challenges I think that we're going to be wrestling with is how to stay pretty normal. Because they and we said this before the campaign, and I believe this. actually think that we are as close to what normal folks go through, and what their lives are like, as just about anybody who's been elected president recently hanging onto that is something that's important. Michelle helps on that 'cause she's just a sensible person.\nKroft: I know you've said that your first priority is to be mom in chief.\nMrs. Obama: Yes.\nKroft:You're a Harvard Law School grad yourself. And a Princeton grad. You were a high-powered executive. How long do you give her, knocking around that big house, before she starts to want to imprint on the job of being first lady?\nThe President-Elect: I think Michelle is gonna design her own role. I think she's gonna set her own path. But I here's one thing I know about Michelle she's serious when she talks about being a mom. That's why our girls are so wonderful. I'd love to take credit for it. But this is the one who deserves most of the credit. AndвЂ¦\nMrs. Obama: Well, the thing we've learned, you know, as we've watched this campaign, is that people, women, are capable of doing more than one thing well at the same time. And I've, you know, had to juggle being mom in chief and having a career for a long time. The primary focus for the first year will be making sure that the kids make it through the transition. But there are many issues that I care deeply about. I care about military families and the work/family balance issue. I care about education. I, both Barack and I, believe that we can have an impact in the D.C. area. You know, in terms of making sure we're contributing to the community that we immediately live in. That's always been something that we try to do. Whether it's in our own neighborhoods or in the schools that we've attended. So there's plenty to do.\nKroft: Did you seriously consider sending the girls to public school?\nMrs. Obama: You know, we're still in the process of figuring out that transition. And what we have asked people to understand is that the decision that we make will be based on the best interest of the girls. We haven't made that decision yet. And you know, we want that to be a persona; process. And people have been really good about respecting that.\nSteve Kroft: How are things coming on the dog front?\nMrs. Obama: The dog, the dog front? We're on-call mode on the dog front. Because the deal with the dog was that we would get the dog after we got settled. Because as responsible owners, I don't think it would be good to get a dog in the midst of transition. So when we settle, get in a routine, we think about late winter, early spring, we're gonna get the dog. Now, we cut that deal with the kids before America knew about it. So they're good with it.\nThe President-Elect: Although, AmericansвЂ¦\nMrs. Obama: They're ready for us to get the dog now.\nThe President-Elect: They are ready.\nKroft: We put the paper down here just in case.\nMrs. Obama: Is thatвЂ¦\nThe President-Elect: I was wondering what that was for.\nKroft: You brought it today.\nThe President-Elect: I thought it was some trick for the lighting or something.\nMrs. Obama: It's about dogs. That's good.\nKroft: Do you have a special transition team for the dog? Or are you just doing that?\nMrs. Obama: We don'tвЂ¦. This is a family event. We're getting a lot of suggestions though. Boy, I mean the people are sending suggestions. And we're taking it all under advisement.\nKroft: There's been a lot of talk about [that] you talked about your mother-in-law. Is she moving in with you?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I don't tell my mother-in-law what to do. But I'm not stupid. That's why I got elected president, man.\nKroft:She can if she wants to.\nThe President-Elect: But, she sure can if she wants. I think it's fair to say that Marian Robinson is one of the unsung heroes of this campaign. We couldn't have done it without her. 'Cause she retired, looked after the girls, gave Michelle confidence that somebody was gonna be there when Michelle was on the road.\nShe's just been an unbelievable support for all of us during this process. And you know, she likes her own space, you know. She doesn't like a lot of fuss around her. And, like it or not, there's some fuss in the White House. But we hope that she comes.\nKroft: So you have a new dog and your mother-in-law moving in.\nThe President-Elect: Steve, I'm not gonna compare my mother-in-law to a new dog.\nKroft: YouвЂ™re much more excited about your mother-in-law\nThe President-Elect: How do you get in long with your mother-in-law man? You know, the way these questions are going I think I need to give you some tips.\nKroft: We get along fine. I have one last question. As president of the United States, what can you do, or what do you plan to do, about getting a college football playoff for the national championship?\nThe President-Elect: This is important. Look, excuse me for a second.\nMrs. Obama: Please. Don't mind me.\nThe President-Elect: I think any sensible person would say that if you've got a bunch of teams who play throughout the season, and many of them have one loss or two losses, there's no clear decisive winner that we should be creating a playoff system.\nEight teams. That would be three rounds, to determine a national champion. It would it would add three extra weeks to the season. You could trim back on the regular season. I don't know any serious fan of college football who has disagreed with me on this. So, I'm gonna throw my weight around a little bit. I think it's the right thing to do.", "timestamp": "2008-11-16", "title": "Interview with Steve Kroft on CBS' \"60 Minutes\""}

I'm glad President Bush has initiated this process -- because our global economic crisis requires a coordinated global response.\nAnd yet, as we act in concert with other nations, we must also act immediately here at home to address America's own economic crisis. This week, amid continued volatility in our markets, we learned that unemployment insurance claims rose to their highest levels since September 11, 2001. We've lost jobs for ten straight months -- nearly 1.2 million jobs this year, many of them in our struggling auto industry. And millions of our fellow citizens lie awake each night wondering how they're going to pay their bills, stay in their homes, and save for retirement.\nMake no mistake: this is the greatest economic challenge of our time. And while the road ahead will be long, and the work will be hard, I know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis -- because here in America we always rise to the moment, no matter how hard. And I am more hopeful than ever before that America will rise once again.\nBut we must act right now. Next week, Congress will meet to address the spreading impact of the economic crisis. I urge them to pass at least a down-payment on a rescue plan that will create jobs, relieve the squeeze on families, and help get the economy growing again. In particular, we cannot afford to delay providing help for the more than one million Americans who will have exhausted their unemployment insurance by the end of this year. If Congress does not pass an immediate plan that gives the economy the boost it needs, I will make it my first order of business as President.\nEven as we dig ourselves out of this recession, we must also recognize that out of this economic crisis comes an opportunity to create new jobs, strengthen our middle class, and keep our economy competitive in the 21st century.\nThat starts with the kinds of long-term investments that we've neglected for too long. That means putting two million Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, and schools. It means investing $150 billion to build an American green energy economy that will create five million new jobs, while freeing our nation from the tyranny of foreign oil, and saving our planet for our children. It means making health care affordable for anyone who has it, accessible for anyone who wants it, and reducing costs for small businesses. And it also means giving every child the world-class education they need to compete with any worker, anywhere in the world.\nDoing all this will require not just new policies, but a new spirit of service and sacrifice, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. If this financial crisis has taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers -- in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people. And that is how we will meet the challenges of our time -- together. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2008-11-15", "title": "The President-Elect's Radio Address"}

This ethics policy for the transition is a far-reaching, bold and constructive step to do just that. The policy may exclude some good people with deep experience in their fields, but it will also exclude those who see government service as a springboard to financial success, or who are more intent on pleasing future potential employers or clients than making tough choices in the public interest.

It didn't matter who they were or where they came from; what they looked like or what party they belonged to - they came out and cast their ballot because they believed that in this country, our destiny is not written for us, but by us. We should all take pride in the fact that we once again displayed for the world the power of our democracy, and reaffirmed the great American ideal that this is a nation where anything is possible.\nThis week, I spoke with President Bush, who graciously offered his full support and assistance in this period of transition. Michelle and I look forward to meeting with him and the First Lady on Monday to begin that process. This speaks to a fundamental recognition that here in America we can compete vigorously in elections and challenge each other's ideas, yet come together in service of a common purpose once the voting is done. And that is particularly important at a moment when we face the most serious challenges of our lifetime.\nYesterday, we woke to more sobering news about the state of our economy. The 240,000 jobs lost in October marks the 10th consecutive month that our economy has shed jobs. In total, we've lost nearly 1.2 million jobs this year, and more than 10 million Americans are now unemployed. Tens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes. Their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime, and we must act swiftly to resolve them.\nIn the wake of these disturbing reports, I met with members of my Transition Economic Advisory Board, who will help guide the work of my transition team in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis. While we must recognize that we only have one President at a time and that President Bush is the leader of our government, I want to ensure that we hit the ground running on January 20th because we don't have a moment to lose.\nWe discussed several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus in the days and weeks ahead to ease the credit crisis, help hardworking families, and restore growth and prosperity.\nFirst, we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provides relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear.\nThen, we'll address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on other sectors of our economy, and ensure that the rescue plan that passed Congress is working to stabilize financial markets while protecting taxpayers, helping homeowners, and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance.\nFinally, we will move forward with a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. We can't afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that I identified during the campaign, including clean energy, health care, education and tax relief for middle class families.\nLet me close by saying I do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead. We've taken some major actions to date, and we will need further actions during this transition and subsequent months. Some of those choices will be difficult, but America is a strong and resilient country. I know that we will succeed if we put aside partisanship and work together as one nation.

Thank you very much.\nThis morning, we woke up to more sobering news about the state of our economy. The 240,000 jobs lost in October marks the 10th consecutive month that our economy has shed jobs. In total, we've lost nearly 1.2 million jobs this year, and more than 10 million Americans are now unemployed.\nTens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes. Their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime, and we're going to have to act swiftly to resolve it.\nNow, the United States has only one government and one president at a time. And until January 20th of next year, that government is the current administration.\nI've spoken to President Bush. I appreciate his commitment to ensuring that his economic policy team keeps us fully informed as developments unfold. And I'm also thankful for his invitation to the White House.\nImmediately after I become president, I'm going to confront this economic crisis head on by taking all necessary steps to ease the credit crisis, help hardworking families, and restore growth and prosperity.\nAnd this morning, I met with members of my Transition Economic Advisory Board, who are standing behind me, alongside my vice president-elect, Joe Biden.\nThey will help to guide the work of my transition team, working with Rahm Emanuel, my chief of staff, in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis. We discussed in the earlier meeting several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus on in the days and weeks ahead.\nFirst of all, we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provide relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear.\nA particularly urgent priority is a further extension of unemployment insurance benefits for workers who cannot find work in the increasingly weak economy.\nA fiscal stimulus plan that will jump-start economic growth is long overdue. I've talked about it throughout this -- the last few months of the campaign. We should get it done.\nSecond, we have to address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on the other sectors of our economy: small businesses that are struggling to meet their payrolls and finance their holiday inventories; and state and municipal governments facing devastating budget cuts and tax increases.\nWe must also remember that the financial crisis is increasingly global and requires a global response.\nThe news coming out of the auto industry this week reminds us of the hardship it faces, hardship that goes far beyond individual auto companies to the countless suppliers, small businesses and communities throughout our nation who depend on a vibrant American auto industry.\nThe auto industry is the backbone of American manufacturing and a critical part of our attempt to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\nI would like to see the administration do everything it can to accelerate the retooling assistance that Congress has already enacted. In addition, I have made it a high priority for my transition team to work on additional policy options to help the auto industry adjust, weather the financial crisis, and succeed in producing fuel-efficient cars here in the United States of America.\nAnd I was glad to be joined today by Governor Jennifer Granholm, who obviously has great knowledge and great interest on this issue.\nI've asked my team to explore what we can do under current law and whether additional legislation will be needed for this purpose.\nThird, we will review the implementation of this administration's financial program to ensure that the government's efforts are achieving their central goal of stabilizing financial markets while protecting taxpayers, helping homeowners, and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance.\nIt is absolutely critical that the Treasury work closely with the FDIC, HUD, and other government agencies to use the substantial authority that they already have to help families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes.\nFinally, as we monitor and address these immediate economic challenges, we will be moving forward in laying out a set of policies that will grow our middle class and strengthen our economy in the long term. We cannot afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that I identified during the campaign, including clean energy, health care, education, and tax relief for middle-class families.\nMy transition team will be working on each of these priorities in the weeks ahead, and I intend to reconvene this advisory board to discuss the best ideas for responding to these immediate problems.\nLet me close by saying this. I do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead. We have taken some major action to date, and we will need further action during this transition and subsequent months.\nSome of the choices that we make are going to be difficult. And I have said before and I will repeat again: It is not going to be quick, and it is not going to be easy for us to dig ourselves out of the hole that we are in.\nBut America is a strong and resilient country. And I know we will succeed, if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together as one nation. That's what I intend to do.\nWith that, let me open it up for some questions. And I'm going to start right here with you.\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. I wonder what you think any president can accomplish during their first 100 days in office to turn the economy around? How far can you go? And what will be your priorities on day one?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I think that a new president can do an enormous amount to restore confidence, to move an agenda forward that speaks to the needs of the economy and the needs of middle-class families all across the country.\nI've outlined during the course of the campaign some critical issues that I intend to work on.\nWe have a current financial crisis that is spilling out into rest of the economy, and we have taken some action so far. More action is undoubtedly going to be needed. My transition team is going to be monitoring very closely what happens over the course of the next several months.\nThe one thing I can say with certainty is that we are going to need to see a stimulus package passed either before or after inauguration.\nWe are going to have to focus on jobs, because the hemorrhaging of jobs has an impact, obviously, on consumer confidence and the ability of people to -- to buy goods and services and can have enormous spillover effects.\nAnd I think it's going to be very important for us to provide the kinds of assistance to state and local governments to make sure that they don't compound some of the problems that are already out there by having to initiate major layoffs or initiate tax increases.\nSo there are some things that we know we're going to have to do, but I'm confident that a new president can have an enormous impact. That's why I ran for president.\nQuestion: (off-mike) ... from House Democrats that the stimulus package may be in trouble, that it's going to be a hard time getting out of a lame-duck session. Are you still confident that you would be able to get something done before you actually take office?\nThe President-Elect: I want to see a stimulus package sooner rather than later. If it does not get done in the lame-duck session, it will be the first thing I get done as president of the United States.\nQuestion: Senator, for the first time since the Iranian revolution, the president of Iran sent a congratulations note to a new U.S. president. I'm wondering if, first of all, if you responded to President Ahmadinejad's note of congratulations and, second of all, and more importantly, how soon do you plan on sending low-level envoys to countries such as Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, to see if a presidential-level talk would be productive?\nThe President-Elect: I am aware that the letter was sent. Let me state -- repeat what I stated during the course of the campaign.\nIran's development of a nuclear weapon I believe is unacceptable. And we have to mount a international effort to prevent that from happening.\nIran's support of terrorist organizations I think is something that has to cease.\nI will be reviewing the letter from President Ahmadinejad, and we will respond appropriately. It's only been three days since the election. Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should, you know, simply do in a knee- jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through.\nBut I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president and I won't be until January 20th.\nQuestion: Picking up what we were just talking about, your meeting with President Bush on Monday. When -- he is still the decider, obviously, stating the obvious. When you disagree with decisions he makes, will you defer? Will you challenge? Will you confront? And if it becomes confrontational, could that rattle the markets even more?\nThe President-Elect: Well, President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to -- to meet with him and First Lady Laura Bush. We are gratified by the invitation. I'm sure that, in addition to taking a tour of the White House, there's going to be a substantive conversation between myself and the president.\nI'm not going to anticipate problems. I'm going to go in there with a spirit of bipartisanship and a sense that both the president and various leaders in Congress all recognize the severity of the situation right now and want to get stuff done.\nAnd, you know, undoubtedly there may end up being differences between not just members of different parties, but between people within the same party.\nThe critical point and I think the critical tone that has to be struck by all of us involved right now is the American people need help. This economy is in bad shape. And we have just completed one of the longest election cycles in recorded history.\nNow is a good time for us to set politics aside for a while and think practically about what will actually work to move the economy forward. And it's in that spirit that I'll have the conversation with the president.\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. With the country facing two wars and a financial crisis, do you think it's important for you to move especially quickly to fill key cabinet posts, such as treasury secretary and secretary of state?\nThe President-Elect: When we have an announcement about cabinet appointments, we will make them. There is no doubt that I think people want to know who's going to make up our team.\nAnd I want to move with all deliberate haste, but I want to emphasize \"deliberate\" as well as \"haste.\" I'm proud of the choice I made of vice president, partly because we did it right. I'm proud of the choice of chief of staff, because we thought it through.\nAnd I think it's very important, in all these key positions, both in the economic team and the national security team, to -- to get it right and not to be so rushed that you end up making mistakes.\nI'm confident that we're going to have an outstanding team, and we will be rolling that out in subsequent weeks.\nQuestion: Yes, sir. To what extent -- to what extent are you planning to use your probably pretty great influence in determining the successor for your Senate seat? And what sort of criteria should the governor be looking at in filling that position?\nThe President-Elect: This is the governor's decision; it is not my decision.\nAnd I think that the criteria that I would have for my successor would be the same criteria that I'd have if I were a voter: somebody who is capable; somebody who is passionate about helping working families in Illinois meet their -- meet their dreams.\nAnd I think there are going to be a lot of good choices out there, but it is the governor's decision to make, not mine.\nLynn Sweet?\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect ...\nThe President-Elect: What happened to your arm, Lynn?\nQuestion: I cracked my shoulder running to your speech on election night.\nThe President-Elect: Oh, no.\n(Laughter)\nQuestion: (inaudible)\nThe President-Elect: I think that was the only major incident during the -- the entire Grant Park celebration.\nQuestion: Thank you for asking. Here's my question. I'm wondering what you're doing to get ready. Have you spoke to any living ex-presidents, what books you might be reading?\nEveryone wants to know, what kind of dog are you going to buy for your girls? Have you decided on a private or public school for your daughters?\nThe President-Elect: Let -- let me list those off.\nIn terms of speaking to former presidents, I've spoken to all of them that are living. Obviously, President Clinton -- I didn't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you know, doing any seances.\nI have re-read some of Lincoln's writings, who's always an extraordinary inspiration.\nAnd, by the way, President Carter, President Bush, Sr., as well as the current president have all been very gracious and offered to provide any help that they can in this transition process.\nWith respect to the dog, this is a major issue. I think it's generated more interest on our Web site than just about anything.\nWe have -- we have two criteria that have to be reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic.\nOn the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So -- so whether we're going to be able to balance those two things I think is a pressing issue on the Obama household.\nAnd with respect to schools, Michelle will be -- will be scouting out some schools. We'll be making a decision about that in the future.\nQuestion: You are now privy to a lot of intelligence that you haven't had access to before, in fact, much of what the president sees, I'm sure all of it.\nFirst of all, do you -- what do you think about the state of U.S. intelligence, whether you think it needs beefing up, whether you think there's enough interaction between the various agencies?\nAnd, second of all, has anything that you've heard given you pause about anything you've talked about on the campaign trail?\nThe President-Elect: Well, as you know, if -- if there was something I had heard, I couldn't tell you. But...\nQuestion: (off-mike)\nThe President-Elect: I have received intelligence briefings. And I will make just a general statement.\nOur intelligence process can always improve. I think it has gotten better. And, you know, beyond that, I don't think I should comment on the nature of the intelligence briefings.\nThat was a two-parter. Was there another aspect to that?\nQuestion: Well, just whether -- you know, absent what you've heard...\nThe President-Elect: OK, I get you.\nQuestion: ... whether anything has given you pause.\nThe President-Elect: I'm going to skip that.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, do you still intend to seek income tax increases for upper-income Americans? And if so, should these Americans expect to pay higher taxes in 2009?\nThe President-Elect: The -- my tax plan represented a net tax cut. It provided for substantial middle-class tax cuts; 95 percent of working Americans would receive them.\nIt also provided for cuts in capital gains for small businesses, additional tax credits. All of it is designed for job growth.\nMy priority is going to be, how do we grow the economy? How do we create more jobs?\nI think that the plan that we've put forward is the right one, but, obviously, over the next several weeks and months, we're going to be continuing to take a look at the data and see what's taking place in the economy as a whole.\nBut, understand, the goal of my plan is to provide tax relief to families that are struggling, but also to boost the capacity of the economy to grow from the bottom up.\nAll right.

I announce this appointment first because the Chief of Staff is central to the ability of a President and Administration to accomplish an agenda. And no one I know is better at getting things done than Rahm Emanuel.\nDuring his seven years in the Clinton White House, Rahm was the point man on some of the most difficult issues, from the passage of landmark anti-crime legislation to the expansion of health care coverage for children. In just six years in Congress, he has risen to leadership, helping to craft myriad important pieces of legislation and guide them to passage. In between, Rahm spent several years in the private sector, where he worked on large and complicated financial transactions. That experience, combined with his service on the committees on Ways and Means and Banking, have given Rahm deep insights into the challenging economic issues that will be front and center for our Administration. Though Rahm understands how to get things done in Washington, he still looks at the world from the perspective of his neighbors and constituents on the Northwest Side of Chicago, who work long and hard, and ask only that their government stand on their side and honor their values. The son of an Israeli immigrant, Rahm shares a passionate love for this country, and has devoted much of his life to its cause.\nHis decision to accept this position is a wonderful reflection of that commitment, for it is not easy to give up the significant position he holds today as chair of the House Democratic conference. The post he has accepted also will require more time away from Amy, and their children, Zach, Ilana and Leah, which I know is painful and difficult.\nI appreciate his friendship. And I, and all Americans, should be grateful that Rahm is once again answering his country's call.", "timestamp": "2008-11-07", "title": "Statement by the President-Elect on Rahm Emanuel's Acceptance of the Position of White House Chief of Staff"}

I'm leaving a job I love to join your White House for one simple reason - like the record amount of voters who cast their ballot over the last month, I want to do everything I can to help deliver the change America needs. We have work to do, and Tuesday Americans sent Washington a clear message – get the job done.\nI have loved the time I spent in the House, both the successes and the setbacks, and I am grateful to the people of the Fifth Congressional district who sent me to work on their behalf. I was proud to serve on a leadership team with Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. They have taught me invaluable lessons—even a few lessons in humility, believe it or not.\nI want to say a special word about my Republican colleagues, who serve with dignity, decency and a deep sense of patriotism. We often disagree, but I respect their motives. Now is a time for unity, and Mr. President-elect, I will do everything in my power to help you stitch together the frayed fabric of our politics, and help summon Americans of both parties to unite in common purpose.\nIt has been almost 150 years since Americans turned to a proud son of Illinois as their President. Early in his first term, Abraham Lincoln said, \"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.\"\nToday, once again, our country is piled high with difficulty, and Americans have put their trust in President-elect Barack Obama and Vice-President-elect Joe Biden to think and act anew.

He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.\nI want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.\nI would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama. Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.\nTo my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics - you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.\nBut above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to - it belongs to you.\nI was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.\nIt was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory.\nI know you didn't do this just to win an election and I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime - two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.\nThe road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you - we as a people will get there.\nThere will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.\nWhat began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek - it is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It cannot happen without you.\nSo let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers - in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.\nLet us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House - a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, \"We are not enemies, but friends...though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.\" And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn - I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too.\nAnd to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world - our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down - we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security - we support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright - tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.\nFor that is the true genius of America - that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.\nThis election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing - Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.\nShe was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons - because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.\nAnd tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America - the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.\nAt a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can.\nWhen there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can.\nWhen the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can.\nShe was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that \"We Shall Overcome.\" Yes we can.\nA man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes we can.\nAmerica, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves - if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?\nThis is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time - to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth - that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:\nYes We Can.

For the last 8 years, I have had the honor of speaking to the American people Saturday mornings through this radio address. In hundreds of broadcasts, I have talked to you about important issues affecting our security and our prosperity. And today, in my final address, I want to send a simple and heartfelt message: Thank you.\nEight years ago, Laura and I left our home in Texas to come to Washington. Through two terms in the White House, we have been blessed by your kind words and generous prayers. We have been inspired by those of you who reach out to feed the hungry, clothe the needy, and care for the sick. We have been moved by the courage and devotion of those of you who wear the uniform. Serving as your President has been an incredible honor.\nLike every individual who has held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. There are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made, but I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.\nThe decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course. While our Nation is safer than it was 7 years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient and determined to strike again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict. But we have been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must resist complacency. We must keep our resolve, and we must never let down our guard.\nAt the same time, we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose. In the face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward. But we must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism. Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger. In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will not be led.\nAs we address these challenges and others we cannot foresee today, America must maintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and evil. This has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise. Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere. Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This Nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace.\nEight years ago, on a cold January morning, I stood on the steps of the United States Capitol, placed my hand on the Bible, and swore a sacred oath to defend our people and our Constitution. On that day, I spoke of \"our Nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.\" Next week, my term of service will come to an end, but that story and that dream will continue.\nOn Tuesday, Laura and I will join all Americans in offering our best wishes to President Obama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls. And later that day, we will return to the love of family and friends in Texas. I will depart office proud of my administration's record, and I will spend the rest of my life grateful for the opportunity to have served as President of the greatest nation on Earth.\nThank you for listening.", "timestamp": "2009-01-17", "title": "The President's Radio Address"}

Fellow citizens: For 8 years, it has been my honor to serve as your President. The first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence, a time set apart. Tonight, with a thankful heart, I have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have traveled together and the future of our Nation.\nFive days from now, the world will witness the vitality of American democracy. In a tradition dating back to our founding, the Presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you, the American people. Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land. This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole Nation. And I join all Americans in offering best wishes to President-elect Obama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls.\nTonight I am filled with gratitude to Vice President Cheney and members of my administration; to Laura, who brought joy to this house and love to my life; to our wonderful daughters Barbara and Jenna; to my parents, whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime. And above all, I thank the American people for the trust you have given me. I thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits. And I thank you for the countless acts of courage, generosity, and grace that I have witnessed these past 8 years.\nThis evening my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this house, September the 11th, 2001. That morning, terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor. I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center 3 days later, surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock. I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke-filled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93. I remember Arlene Howard, who gave me her fallen son's police shield as a reminder of all that was lost. And I still carry his badge.\nAs the years passed, most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11. But I never did. Every morning, I received a briefing on the threats to our Nation. I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe.\nOver the past 7 years, a new Department of Homeland Security has been created. The military, the intelligence community, and the FBI have been transformed. Our Nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists' movements, freeze their finances, and break up their plots. And with strong allies at our side, we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them. Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored Al Qaida and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school. Iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United States.\nThere is legitimate debate about many of these decisions, but there can be little debate about the results. America has gone more than 7 years without another terrorist attack on our soil. This is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safe: law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, homeland security and diplomatic personnel, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.\nOur Nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger. I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families. And America owes you a debt of gratitude. And to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight: There has been no higher honor than serving as your Commander in Chief.\nThe battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems. Under one, a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology, condemns women to subservience, and marks unbelievers for murder. The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God, and that liberty and justice light the path to peace.\nThis is the belief that gave birth to our Nation. And in the long run, advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens. When people live in freedom, they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror. When people have hope in the future, they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism. So around the world, America is promoting human liberty, human rights, and human dignity. We're standing with dissidents and young democracies, providing AIDS medicine to dying patients—to bring dying patients back to life, and sparing mothers and babies from malaria. And this great republic, born alone in liberty, is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations.\nFor 8 years, we've also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home. Across our country, students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools. A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled. Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes. The addicted and suffering are finding new hope through face—faith-based programs. Vulnerable human life is better protected. Funding for our veterans has nearly doubled. America's air and water and lands are measurably cleaner. And the Federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.\nWhen challenges to our prosperity emerged, we rose to meet them. Facing the prospect of a financial collapse, we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy. These are very tough times for hardworking families. But the toll would be far worse if we had not acted. All Americans are in this together. And together, with determination and hard work, we will restore our economy to the path of growth. We will show the world once again the resilience of America's free enterprise system.\nLike all who have held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. And there are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made, but I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.\nThe decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles that shape—should shape our course.\nWhile our Nation is safer than it was 7 years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient and determined to strike again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict. But we have been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must resist complacency. We must keep our resolve. And we must never let down our guard.\nAt the same time, we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose. In the face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward. But we must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism. Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger. In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will not be led.\nAs we address these challenges and others we cannot foresee tonight, America must maintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and evil, and this has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise. Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere. Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This Nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace.\nPresident Thomas Jefferson once wrote, \"I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.\" As I leave the house he occupied two centuries ago, I share that optimism. America is a young country, full of vitality, constantly growing and renewing itself. And even in the toughest times, we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead.\nI have confidence in the promise of America because I know the character of our people. This is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom. This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger and compassion in the face of suffering. We see examples of America's character all around us. And Laura and I have invited some of them to join us in the White House this evening.\nWe see America's character in Dr. Tony Recasner, a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of Hurricane Katrina. We see it in Julio Medina, a former inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to society. We see it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade, who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow marines.\nWe see America's character in Bill Krissoff, a surgeon from California. His son Nathan, a marine, gave his life in Iraq. When I met Dr. Krissoff and his family, he delivered some surprising news. He told me he wanted to join the Navy Medical Corps in honor of his son. This good man was 60 years old, 18 years above the age limit. But his petition for a waiver was granted, and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine. Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight because he will soon deploy to Iraq, where he will help save America's wounded warriors and uphold the legacy of his fallen son.\nIn citizens like these, we see the best of our country, resilient and hopeful, caring and strong. These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America. We have faced danger and trial, and there's more ahead. But with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals, this great Nation will never tire, never falter, and never fail.\nIt has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President. There have been good days and tough days. But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people. I have been blessed to represent this Nation we love. And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any other, citizen of the United States of America.\nAnd so, my fellow Americans, for the final time, good night. May God bless this house and our next President, and may God bless you and our wonderful country. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2009-01-15", "title": "Farewell Address to the Nation"}

Ensuring that this transition is seamless is a top priority for the rest of my time in office. Our country faces economic challenges that will not pause to let a new President settle in. This will also be America's first wartime Presidential transition in four decades. We're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us, and they would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people.\nSo my administration will work hard to ensure that the next President and his team can hit the ground running. For more than a year now, the White House and agencies throughout the Federal Government have been preparing for a smooth transition. We've provided intelligence briefings to the President-elect, and the Department of Justice has approved security clearances for members of his transition staff. In the coming weeks, we will ask administration officials to brief the Obama team on major ongoing policy issues, ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq. I will keep the President-elect fully informed on important decisions during this critical time for our Nation.

To help address the global financial crisis, my administration will host an historic international summit in Washington on November the 15th.

We've just finished a Cabinet meeting, and I gave them—it gave me a chance to tell them how much I appreciate the good work they're doing during this critical time for our Nation.\nI also appreciate the men and women who make up the Executive Office of the President for joining us today. Some of you have been at the White House for just a few months, others arrived the same day that we did nearly 8 years ago. You're the ones who can tell that my hair has gotten a little grayer.

No matter how we cast our ballots, this election gives us all reason to be proud of our democracy and our country. And I hope you will join Laura and me in congratulating President-elect Obama and wishing him the very best for his family and our country.\nJust before our Inauguration in 2001, Laura and I went back to Midland, Texas. She was born there, and I was raised there. I said that Laura and I would never quite settle in Washington. I told them, \"While the honor is great, the work is temporary.\" This is true for many of us here today. This peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of a true democracy, and ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the rest of my Presidency. We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new President settle in. This will also be America's first wartime Presidential transition in four decades. We're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us, and they would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people.\nSo over the next 75 days, all of us must ensure that the next President and his team can hit the ground running. For more than a year now, departments and agencies throughout the Federal Government have been preparing for a smooth transition. We've provided intelligence briefings to the President-elect, and the Department of Justice has approved security clearances for members of his transition team. In the coming weeks, we will ask administration officials to brief the Obama team on ongoing policy issues, ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq. I look forward to discussing those issues with the President-elect early next week.\nOffices within the White House are at work preparing extensive transition materials. We're preparing career employees throughout the administration to take on added responsibilities to help prevent any disruption to the essential functions of the Federal Government.\nTaken together, these measures represent an unprecedented effort to ensure that the executive branch is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities at all times. As we carry out this transition, I know that you will continue to conduct yourselves with the decency and professionalism you have shown throughout my time in office.\nSuccessful transition is just one of the many important tasks remaining in our last 75 days. To help address the global financial crisis, the Secretary of Treasury is working endless hours, and I will host an international summit here in Washington on November the 15th. This will be an historic meeting, and I'm confident that you will work hard to help make it a success.\nWe'll also keep urging Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland by defeating the terrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home.\nAs January 20th draws near, some of you may be anxious about finding a new job or a new place to live. I know how you feel. [Laughter] But between now and then, we must keep our attention on the task at hand, because the American people expect no less. Earlier this year, I promised that I would sprint to the finish. I am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some of you a good workout along the way. As we head into the final stretch, I ask you to remain focused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you at the finish line.

{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84739", "text": "The Administration's Preparations for the Transition are Unprecedented in Scope and Depth\nToday, the Transition Coordinating Council (TCC) will meet for the second time, continuing the Administration's comprehensive transition efforts. The peaceful transfer of power from one Presidential Administration to the next is a hallmark of American democracy. With our Nation at war, our homeland targeted by terrorist adversaries, and our economy facing serious challenges, the Administration is committed to establishing and executing a transition plan that minimizes disruption, maintains continuity, and addresses the major changes in government since the 2000 transition, including the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, as well as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Homeland Security Council.\n* The TCC will help ensure that the Administration's efforts are comprehensive and well coordinated. The TCC membership includes the President's Chief of Staff and others with authority and expertise in areas that affect a Presidential transition, as well as senior officials in critical areas such as national security, homeland security, and our economy.\n* Executive Order 13476, which was signed by President Bush in October and created the TCC, contains a provision which allows the TCC to \"obtain a wide range of facts and information on prior transitions and best practices\" by seeking the expertise of outside individuals. The experts attending today's meeting are from both parties and varying backgrounds. They include:  Andy Card, former Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush and Director of the 1992 Bush-Clinton Transition  Mack McLarty, former Chief of Staff to former President Clinton Jennifer Dorn, National Academy of Public Administration Norm Ornstein, American Enterprise Institute  Max Stier, Partnership for Public Service\nThis Administration's Transition Preparations Are Comprehensive\nThe President has directed his Cabinet and staff to be forward-leaning in all of their efforts to ensure a smooth and effective transition. It has never been more critical that a transition from one Administration to the next be as seamless as possible. This Administration has gone to great lengths to prepare the Federal government for the transition to a new Administration and to help the major-party candidates prepare for a Presidential transition. For example:\n* Federal agencies and White House offices are preparing briefings for the President-elect's team on significant pending policy issues as well as the structure of those agencies and offices.\n* Career executives within each agency who may assume added responsibilities before the arrival of new political appointees have been identified, briefed, and included in a wide range of preparatory activities. Office of Management and Budget officials continue to meet with these key career officials to detail their responsibilities and to clarify the transition process.\n* Individual agencies are taking agency-specific steps:  The Department of Defense's Transition Task Force is preparing to host transition teams of the President-elect. The Department of Homeland Security is holding conferences and exercises designed to boost incident management capabilities and cross-departmental awareness.  On October 9-10, the Secretary of State held an offsite meeting with senior State Department and USAID leadership to discuss transition planning and foreign policy and management challenges facing the new Administration. The State Department is also preparing a list of pending political/economic commitments arranged by country.\nThe Administration Is Engaged In A Nonpartisan, Comprehensive, And Unprecedented Effort To Help The Two Major Party Candidates Prepare To Govern\nThe Administration has reached out and provided services to both campaigns. Changes made in the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act allow the Administration to work with the major-party candidates before the election. This Administration is doing more than has ever been done to help the major-party candidates prepare. The White House began working with transition representatives of both major-party candidates during the summer and has met regularly with them since then by phone and in person.\nThe Administration's efforts to prepare the major party candidates include:\n* The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided intelligence briefings to the candidates. These briefings are continuing and are being supported by the entire intelligence community.\n* Senior Administration officials have remained in close contact with the major-party candidates in recent months regarding important issues of national security and our current financial crisis.\n* The Office of Government Ethics has trained additional staff to prepare for an increase in financial disclosure filings and has held extensive meetings with both campaign transition teams to discuss financial disclosure rules.\nThe Administration has also worked to facilitate a speedy security clearance process for key transition personnel. Historically, one of the biggest challenges faced by incoming Administrations has been the time required to obtain security clearances for key officials. The 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act allows major-party candidates to request clearances for key transition personnel before the election so that those individuals will have the necessary clearances should their candidate win.\n* The White House worked with Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the transition teams to create an orderly and efficient process. To ensure a confidential process, the White House does not have access to the numbers and identities of cleared individuals. Nevertheless, the White House confirms regularly with the transition teams that the process meets the transition teams' needs.\nAll interactions with the candidates and their transition teams have been equitable. The cornerstone of the Administration's contact has been uniformity of access. Materials, meetings, and guidance given to one transition team are simultaneously offered to the other.", "timestamp": "2008-10-28", "title": "Fact Sheet: Ensuring a Smooth and Effective Presidential Transition"}
