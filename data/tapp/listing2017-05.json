Great to have you here on this breezy day in the Kennedy Garden and to be able to talk with all of you about the extraordinary difference that independent community bankers make in the life of America's economy, in the life of America's families every day.\nThe President will be joining us in just a few minutes, but I have the great privilege of being able to share just a few thoughts about the President's priorities and the gratitude that we all feel for the leadership and the support that each of you provide.\nBut first let me invite you to give one more of round of applause for Linda McMahon, and the great job she is doing at the Small Business Administration. (Applause.) We are all glad for her tireless work for job creators. I grew up in a small business family in a small town in southern Indiana. And I can tell you that having an entrepreneur and an American success story like Linda McMahon as our Administrator at the SBA is already making a difference in the life of our economy. And we're truly grateful for all of her work.\nI want to thank all the members of the Independent Community Bankers of America who are here. Since 1930, the ICBA has given voice to small and community banks all across America. It's a testament of your impact. Today you boast more than 5,800 members all across the greatest nation on Earth. Give yourselves a round of applause. That is an incredible impact. (Applause.)\nAnd your businesses -- I know firsthand, your businesses are pillars of the community. You can't go to a softball game, you can't stand in the bleachers at a basketball game without seeing your banners hanging and supporting every worthy cause in every community where you live.\nAll told community banks are also big-time employers -- 760,000 people work each and every day issuing loans to a stunning $3.2 trillion in value to working families, small businesses, and family farms. You might be small in community banks, but you have a big, big impact on a growing American economy. (Applause.)\nI want to thank your ICBA leadership -- Cam Fine, Scott Heitkamp, Tim Zimmerman, and Preston Kennedy -- for putting today's even together. I know the President is really looking forward to greeting you and welcoming you here. Your tireless work is making a difference far beyond the lobbies and hallways of your banks. The President knows what all of us know when community banks are strong, America is strong. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say I've heard this businessman-turned-President many times talk about the challenges facing businesses all across this country, and the financial crunch that we have faced in recent years. The President I know is personally committed to helping you succeed and to break down the barriers that you face.\nAnd I can promise you under President Donald Trump, Dodd-Frank's days are numbered. (Applause.)\nI don't have to tell you about the harmful effects of this failed law. Dodd-Frank restricts your customers' choices, their freedom to make financial choices that are best for them, their families, and their businesses. It creates a two-class system for banks. It truly does -- one for big and for small. It erodes accountability and gives bureaucrats more control over your business.\nMore than 22,000 pages of red tape have already been issued under Dodd-Frank, costing money, time, and resources that oftentimes community banks just don't have to spare. Since Dodd-Frank was passed seven years ago, it's heartbreaking to think that America has lost more than 1,500 small banks and only five new banks have opened in the wake of the passage of this failed law.\nThe damage, of course, doesn't end at the doorways of your banks. Dodd-Franks is costing our economy in almost incalculable ways, hurting working families, small businesses, and family farms that depend on the services that each one of you provide. The burden I know falls heaviest on small businesses, the engines of the American economy and the drivers of job creation. We see great enthusiasm in the American economy since President Trump raised his right hand 102 days ago. (Applause.)\nBut you all know that enthusiasm, that willingness to take risks among our small business owners and family farmers has got to be met with resources and the ability of our small and community banks to be able to provide those resources in an orderly way so that America can grow in big cities and small towns is essential (inaudible) Your banks do the lion's share of small business lending. And unfortunately the share of loans going to small businesses has dropped by more than a third under Dodd-Frank. But that's all about to change.\nThe simple truth of the matter is that the policies that have advanced from the last administration simply can't continue. So dismantling Dodd-Frank is a major part of the President's legislative agenda, and we will get it done. (Applause.)\nIn February, President Trump issued an executive order on what he called the core principles for regulating the United States' financial system, and I know you're all familiar with it. He laid out a vision for real reform that will ensure the integrity of our financial services in this country while still being able to fuel economic growth. The President is determined along with our entire administration to seek a system that fosters economic growth and vibrant financial markets, empowers families to make their own financial decisions, enables companies to be competitive here and across the world as they do business, and restores accountability and transparency to the federal bureaucracy.\nTo that end, the President ordered our Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to evaluate every federal law and regulation in light of this vision, and that work is going forward vigorously. The President I know is truly grateful -- truly grateful -- for the leadership in Congress that will be working with our administration in the days ahead. But special thanks to Congressman Jeb Hensarling, the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, for his strong leadership turning the page on Dodd-Frank and bringing it once and for all to an end. (Applause.)\nHis CHOICE Act, we believe, is an enormously important step toward real reform and would unburden community banks and spur growth. The CHOICE Act is a common-sense bill that repeals Dodd-Frank and empowers consumers and businesses, not bureaucrats and lawyers.\nOur administration will continue to work with Chairman Hensarling and the rest of Congress on this vital issue, I promise you that. We're already making some progress, and I promise you, with President Trump in the Oval Office, we're going to get the job done and unleash the boundless potential of the American economy with our community and independent banks helping to drive that recovery. (Applause.)\nThis is absolutely one of the President's top priorities, and he wanted me to come out here today and make sure and share the substance of that with all of you.\nAnd I just would say as I close that it's a joy to see all of you. Some of you remember me back in the day when I was a member of Congress, fighting against Dodd-Frank. You can imagine how humbling it is for me to be standing before you today here at the White House as Vice President to a President who understands the American economy and is going to take America back in the direction of the policies that will ensure a boundless economic future. It's incredible. And you all have been a part of it.\nYou've been a part of continuing to make this case and carrying this case forward to the American people. And we're all grateful. But I just want to encourage you -- I do believe your buttons are right -- (laughter). America loves community banks. In small-town America and medium-sized cities all across the America, you're the difference makers. You're the folks that don't so much look at a balance sheet, but you look people in the face because it's not a matter of seeing forms filled out, it's a matter of people that you know. You see them walking up and down the street. You see them at places of worship. You see them at ballgames.\nEach and every day, you make decisions not so much by running a calculator, but by calculating in your heart who that person is and the character of the men and women that are building the enterprises of your communities.\nMy dad is gone now about 30 years. My dad ran a small business, a gas station business in a small town. But I know how he spoke about our local bankers, and the ability that they gave him and his company the opportunity to grow. You do that. In a very real sense, our community banks make dreams come true every day for working families, for small businesses. And I just want you to know from the bottom of my heart, we have a President who knows that too. We have a President who has lived the American Dream, and we have a President who understands the vital role that our community banks play in ensuring that every American has a chance to live that dream as well.\nSo with that, I'll step off the stage, and the next voice you hear will be the President of the United States of America. Stay tuned. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-05-01", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President to the Independent Community Bankers Association"}

And thank you so -- how about a round of applause for Linda McMahon, the Administrator of the Small Business -- stand up and take a bow, will you please? (Applause.) She's amazing. (Applause.)\nAnd more on our other honored guests in just a moment. But it's just such a joy to be able to welcome you all here to Washington, D.C. And I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) He grew up in a small family business; so did I. And I have to tell you, mine was a little smaller than his. (Laughter.) But it is a particular joy, I know, on his behalf, for us to welcome you here to join in the celebration of National Small Business Week to honor the millions of small businesses that are the beating heart of the American economy. (Applause.)\nI hope you all enjoyed the discussion that just wrapped up. I'm proud to be one of your cleanup speakers today. (Laughter.) But I know the conversation that took place, hearing from Linda McMahon and hearing from the remarkable business success story and leader that is Ivanka Trump was a great joy for all of you. Would you give her a warm welcome as well? (Applause.) You can give her a standing ovation too, I just didn't go on -- Ivanka Trump, everybody, is a business leader and a champion for small business. (Applause.)\nIvanka, your leadership is inspiring businesses all across this country, and especially women in business. She's been a voice across the country and now all over the world -- a voice for empowering women business leaders. And I see some great women business leaders in small business gathered here today, so give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) Thank you again, Ivanka, for your great leadership. (Applause.)\nIt is great to be here at the start of National Small Business Week. Since 1963, the President of the United States has honored America's small businesses by instituting this week and recognizing the tremendous contributions that small businesses make to our country each and every day.\nJust this weekend, President Trump signed a declaration asserting these words: \"Small-business owners embody the American pioneering spirit, and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement every day.\" (Applause.)\nAnd I lived it. I just -- I greeted some people along with the President in the Kennedy Garden just a few minutes ago, and I talked about growing up in a small business myself.\nI grew up in a small town in southern Indiana, and my dad ran a little gas station business. And when I was only 14 years of age, I went to work as a gas station attendant. (Laughter.) And for those of you under the age of 30, we'll explain to you later what a gas station attendant was. (Laughter.) But I had my first name on my shirt, and when the car pulled onto the drive I ran to the car, okay, ran to the car, checked the oil, checked the tires, washed the windshield, didn't even charge you anymore money for it. (Laughter and applause.)\nBut I grew up in a family business. And, as the world knows, President Trump grew up in a family business too. It was one of the things -- as our families started to get to know one another, didn't we, Ivanka, we all realized that while we were small-town Indiana and they were big-city New York City, the bond that we shared was a family that worked in business together.\nI remember one of my very first conversations with Ivanka and her brothers, was I heard them say that when they were growing up, the way they spent time with their dad on the weekends was on a job site, on a work site. And I'll never forget Eric saying to me over dinner when we were just having some of our first conversations, he says, and we went -- when we went with dad, we worked. (Laughter.) This is a President who knows what makes a small family business work, and he's going to fight for you every single day. (Applause.)\nWe know that sacrifices are necessary, and we know, both of us do -- and I would say especially the President -- here's the way he puts it: When small business is strong, America is strong. And that's why we're going to fight for your prosperity and opportunity every day of this administration.\nThe truth is that small businesses are the foundation of our communities and pillars of the American economy. A stunning 99.7 percent of all businesses in America are small businesses. And no fewer than 57 million Americans work for small businesses. Nearly half of all private sector jobs in the United States of America are at small businesses.\nFolks, that's amazing. And on behalf of the President of the United States, let me personally thank every small business who has gathered here today for the opportunities that you create every day for the American people. (Applause.) And every single one of you are a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, and now you've made a difference, not just in your family's life but in the lives of your employees, the life of your community, and the life of our country.\nYou know, it's the small businesses that are really the lifeblood of small communities and large communities all over the country. I mean, you can't hardly go to a softball game without seeing the banner of a local business hanging on the fence at the back of the field. Every philanthropic effort, every worthy cause in communities finds an ally in the small businesses that are so well represented here at this forum today.\nAnd let me also say -- I want to give congratulations to the National Small Business Person of the Year -- the two persons of the year, Garrett and Melanie Marrero of the Maui Brewing Company in Hawaii. (Applause.) Appreciate it. You just did that Hawaii thing. I just learned to -- (laughter) -- I did, I just learned that. I was visiting troops on the way back from the Asia Pacific and they taught me that little Hawaii thing. There you go. Listen, we want to congratulate -- he was very insistent when we met backstage that he and his wife have built this small business together, and you have our congratulations.\nCongratulations also to all the runners-up. Deborah Dudley, of Oscarware in Kentucky. (Applause.) Rozanna Garman, from RHD Enterprises in California. (Applause.) And Corliss Udoema, from Contract Solutions, just across the river in Virginia. (Applause.)\nAnd I'd like to recognize all of you who won Best Small Person Business of the Year in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and, if you'll permit me, let me just say to Dave Thompson, who's here representing Joey Rivera from Rivera Consulting in the state of Indiana, congratulations to all our state winners. We are proud of you all. (Applause.)\nYou know, the truth is, we're celebrating today not just because each and every one of you deserves the recognition and the encouragement for all the long hours, but the truth is, our economy, from coast to coast, depends on each one of you every single day. Your strength is America's strength and the success of our country depends on your success. And I'm here today to promise you that President Donald Trump is going to work every day to make your businesses stronger, to make them more successful than ever because President Donald Trump is the best friend America's small business will ever have in the White House. I promise you that.\nPresident Trump knows what we said before, that small businesses are the engines of the American economy, and as President Trump has promised, we're going to restart the engine of the American economy to create jobs and prosperity and growth like never before. And as the President loves to say, it's going to happen a lot faster than you could possibly imagine. In fact, it's already happening. It's a promise he's made to you and the American people, and, as we like to say, we're in the promise-keeping business in this White House.\nIt's really been inspiring to see President Trump's unwavering commitment to small businesses in his first 100 days in office. On day one, President Trump went right to work, fighting for each and every one of you. He picked a world-class Cabinet filled with business leaders who know what it takes to succeed in a competitive marketplace. People like Linda McMahon; our new Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta -- who I just had the privilege of swearing in this past Friday -- are all people that really understand, along with our Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, and other, what it takes to make the American economy hum.\nPresident Trump has also signed more bills cutting job-killing regulations than any President in American history already. (Applause.)\nHere's one of my favorites -- one of my favorites is, early on the President instructed every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new regulation on businesses large and small in the United States of America. He authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines to protect America's energy future, and the President is cutting back mandates and rules that are raising your energy costs and making it harder for businesses to get ahead and to grow.\nNo matter where you look, President Trump has taken decisive action to get government out of the way so you can do more, create more, innovate more, and grow more jobs. And American small businesses know it. All across this countries, small businesses haven't been this optimistic in a decade. And they have good reason to be. With the efforts of those of you in this room and the businesses you represented, it's remarkable to say that, in 2017 alone so far, the American economy, driven by American small business has created 500,000 new jobs for the American people. It's an incredible start. (Applause.)\nAnd folks, he's just getting started. This last week, President Trump laid out a plan keeping another promise to the American people that he made. This President is going to go to the Congress in the days ahead, and we're going to pass the largest tax cut in American history. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. (Applause.)\nWe're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.) And we're going to give the American people the kind of world-class healthcare they deserve. You know it really is a remarkable debate, and it's still going on even as we speak. I'm headed to Capitol Hill right after I leave you, and we're continuing to talk with members of Congress.\nIt was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace this disastrous policy, but the President remains confident that with your strong support -- and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town -- (laughter) -- that we'll get a fresh start on healthcare in America.\nThe truth is, every single promise of Obamacare has been broken. Remember all of them? They said, if you like your doctor, you can keep him. It wasn't true. They said, if you like your insurance, you could keep it. It wasn't true. They told you the cost of health insurance and premiums would go down. Actually, we've seen premiums skyrocket across the country.\nWell, I want to promise you, working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capital keeps our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare, and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want, not that the government mandates and dictates. I promise you that. (Applause.)\nBeyond all that, we're going to keep slashing through red tape, we're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks.\nWe're going to roll back the Dodd-Frank legislation so that small businesses like yours will have access to lending and financing so you can grow your business with your independent and community bankers in your hometown. (Applause.)\nAnd if you haven't noticed it yet, the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States, and we're going to pass an infrastructure bill so that America once again has the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways and airports, and the best future we could possibly imagine. We're going to rebuild America, and it's going to support economic growth. (Applause.)\nUnder President Trump's leadership, we're going to do all this and more, with your support, so that every small business, and anyone who dreams someday of starting a small business, has the best shot at success.\nThis week, with President Trump, we'll celebrate all that small businesses have achieved and all that you do for America each and every day.\nBut today, we also recommit ourselves. We recommit ourselves to the President's agenda of strengthening small businesses so that you can accomplish even more in the months and years ahead.\nAnd let me just say, before I close, how much I admire everyone in this room. You know, I'll never forget when I started my own little business in the basement of my house, it was the scariest time of my life, and the most exciting. I had an idea, so I hung some fluorescent lights down in the basement, I put in a phone line and a fax machine. All the kids were real small, Ivanka. They were all under the age of five. And I told Karen, I'm going downstairs to work the phones and work on the business, and she kept track of all the kids running around upstairs. I could hear them all day long. (Laughter.)\nBut it was an exciting time, and I remember every single morning. What it drew out of me was the faith and the perseverance and the determination. You know, when you work for yourself, when you're building something for yourself, you've got to find more in yourself. And each and every one of you have done that, and you've become the kind of people that have really just made your communities a more special place to live and to work and to raise a family.\nAnd so I just, lastly, on behalf of our President, just want to thank you for all those long and lonely hours, for all the energy and effort that you've put into building your small business. Because ultimately, it hasn't been for you. It's been for the people that you love, it's been for the people that you employ, and it's a benefit to your communities, to your state and your nation. And I just am here to tell you that your President knows that. He's lived that. And his Vice President knows it and has lived it as well.\nSo we thank you for all your sacrifices. We honor you today for the recognition that you have received, winners all in this room. And we wish you every blessing for much continued success.\nAnd let me close by saying I have faith. I have faith that under President Donald Trump, America's small businesses are going to continue to lead the way, to drive our economy and foster a brighter future for yourselves, your communities, and our countries, just as you always have. And I say with confidence, with President Donald Trump in the White House, the best days for American small business and the best days for America are yet to come.\nThank you very much. God bless you. It's wonderful to be with you all. And congratulations on your honors today.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123904", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:55 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: I hope you guys had a good weekend. It was definitely a busy one for the Trump administration. On Friday, the President signed several proclamations ahead of the start of the new month. Those are all available at whitehouse.gov.\nOn Saturday, you may have not noticed, but it was the President's 100th day in office, for those of you not keeping count. The President took several significant steps towards leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses while visiting an Ames factory in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ames has been making tools in America since before our country's founding. It's an example of the amazing persistence of the American spirit -- the type of company that will be able to expand and create new jobs under the President's pro-growth economic agenda.\nHe signed two executive orders at Ames that will help keep jobs and wealth in our country. The first fulfilled an executive order of a major campaign promise by directing the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation and abuse of our trade agreements and to use every measure available under the law the end those abuses.\nAnd the second established the Office of Trade Manufacturing policy, which will be led by Dr. Peter Navarro. This office replaces the National Trade Council and elevates it to a permanent office within the White House, sending an important signal to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate trade cheating while our manufacturing and defense-industrial base suffers.\nHe also signed a third executive order over the weekend establishing the American Technology Council, which will be led by Chris Liddell, which is dedicated to modernizing the federal government's information technology so that it works more efficiently and effectively for everyone. And he wrapped up the day speaking to thousands at a rally in Pennsylvania.\nThis weekend, the President also engaged with some of our longtime allies in Southeast Asia who are on the frontlines against the fight against ISIS and other forms of terror through calls with the President of the Philippines, the Prime Minister of Singapore, and the Prime Minister of Thailand.\nToday is the start of another big week here. After signing a proclamation on Law Day, he stopped by the Kennedy Garden, where around 100 members of the Independent Community Bankers of America kicked off their Capital Summit. Smaller banks are one of the driving forces behind economic investment and development in our communities, but they have been disproportionately harmed by the dramatic increase in regulation since 2008, declining in number by 20 percent since 2008.\nThe President's pro-growth agenda, including instituting what he has called a 21st century Glass-Steagall, will allow these banks to spend less time complying with unnecessary requirements, many of which were designed to police much larger entities, and more time, infusing their communities and local small businesses with capital.\nIt's also the start of Small Business Week. Today, Ivanka Trump will be participating in a conversation at the United States Institute of Peace with SBA Administrator Linda McMahon, and the Vice President will deliver remarks at the National Small Business Week awards program later this afternoon.\nBack to the President's schedule. After speaking with the Community Bankers members, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, as well as National Security Advisor McMaster before meeting separately with Secretary Tillerson.\nI also want to mention this morning that FEMA held a severe weather coordination call to discuss impacts on the remaining threat for continued severe weather across portions of the Southwest to the Mississippi Valley, which has already killed five people in Texas. Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly participated on the call, and the White House is in contact with local residents in these affected areas. We'll have those communities in our thoughts and prayers, and encourage everyone to follow the directions of their state, tribal, and local officials to stay safe.\nFinally let me run down what we're expecting for the President's schedule this week. Tomorrow, he'll present the Commander-in-Chief Trophy to the United States Air Force Academy. Wednesday, the President will host the President of the Palestinian Authority for an official visit. And on Thursday, he'll host a National Day of Prayer event. And as I mentioned last week, he will then attend an event commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea aboard the United States Senate Intrepid, and meet with the Prime Minister of Australia.\nI'll continue to update you on the schedule throughout the week. And with that, your questions.\nJill.\nQ: Thank you very much. So I wanted to go back to the comments that the President made this weekend on \"Face the Nation\" on healthcare regarding preexisting conditions. He said specifically that the bill he wants to sign would \"mandate\" the preexisting conditions be covered. Can you talk us through a little bit of what he meant there? Was he referring to something he wants to push to include in the bill? Was he talking about the language that's already in there?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think both, in the sense that the MacArthur-Meadows amendment ensures that preexisting conditions continue to be covered. But then obviously as this bill hopefully passes the House this week, or whenever it does, and then goes through the Senate and the House, this is an issue that is important to him.\nQ: How does he ensure, though, that those people actually are treated affordably? I mean, there was an estimate from AARP that if you're looking just at the high-risk pool, the premiums can be as high as over $25,000 for somebody. What is he doing to ensure that that doesn't happen?\nMR. SPICER: So there's two things -- and I think he mentioned in the same interview -- just to be clear, right now, under Obamacare, as it collapses on its own weight, people who have preexisting conditions are really the most vulnerable. Because if you have an insurance system that no longer is able to provide care to those who need it, then -- I think we've talked about this before -- you have a card without coverage.\nSo what the President is doing is ensuring, going forward as we attempt to repeal and replace it, that coverage of preexisting conditions is at the core of that. So that is something that he is ensured is in the current bill and we'll continue to push for to make sure that coming out of the Senate and going to conference it's there as well.\nJohn.\nQ: Couple things for you, Sean, if I could. First of all, what do you say to conservatives who feel like they didn't get a whole lot out of this spending bill? There was no money for the wall, no cuts to sanctuary cities, funding for Planned Parenthood was maintained. What do you say to those conservatives?\nMR. SPICER: Let's take them in order. But I think the President got a lot out of this bill, most specifically $21 billion to help rebuild the military. I think that is something that he was very proud to campaign on and is delivering on. That's probably the biggest thing.\nWith respect to border security, he got $1.52 billion in the current language that's posted. I think that's a significant -- and remember, I think people have to keep in context, we're talking about 2017 funding, right? So this is something that most Presidents would walk into office and that would have been done. Because the last Congress didn't do this under President Obama, we have an opportunity to get some of the President's priorities infused for the last five months of 2017.\nThat's a big step forward, and something that he'll continue to fight for in 2018. When the fiscal year starts the end of September, we will have an opportunity to really infuse the President's priorities. But I think there's a lot there, and there's also -- D.C. school choice was something that we felt very strongly about, making sure it was back in. There's no Obamacare bailout. The coal miners is something that the President felt very strong on, making sure they got taken care of. That happened. So there's a lot in this bill that I think -- of the priorities that he put forward on.\nQ: But clearly, he did give up on some things.\nMR. SPICER: No, I mean, I think on the Planned Parenthood thing in particular -- but again, remember, this is 2017 funding. This is something that he wouldn't normally even had a shot at because it should have been done. So infusing his priorities in the 2017 budget cycle is actually something that he's been able to have a say in, which is a big deal for the remaining five months.\nThe 2018 budget will address those things, but this is a down payment on border security. It's a down payment on his ability to rebuild the military. And repealing and replacing Obamacare will address a lot of the other healthcare issues.\nQ: And the other -- I had, on the pending visit of Duterte from the Philippines. Chris Coons said that the President is giving his stamp of approval to human rights abuses. Governor John Sununu, on the other hand, said this is part of the unpleasant things that Presidents have to do. What's the White House's perspective on Duterte and him coming here?\nMR. SPICER: I think it is an opportunity for us to work with countries in that region that can help play a role in diplomatically and economically isolating North Korea. And, frankly, the national interest of the United States, the safety of our people and the safety of people in the region are the number-one priorities of the President.\nMike.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about the tax deductions. The White House has talked a little bit about that as a way to curb big tax breaks for the rich. Are you looking at any other policy changes when it comes to limiting breaks for the top 1 percent?\nMR. SPICER: Well, we're at the beginning of this process, but I think you saw from the briefing that was given the other day, the focus on this is really on lower- and middle-income Americans. The doubling of the standard deduction means that a family of four that is making -- right now they're getting a $24,000 deduction, which means, in a lot of cases, you're going to see a family pay zero taxes at the lower end of the economic scale. That's a big deal for them to really help put more money back in their pocket and help them take care of their family.\nTrey.\nQ: On healthcare, there seems to be a new optimism from the White House. How confident is the President that he will get a healthcare bill past the House this week?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has made it clear that he's not instituting a timeline. I've said this before and I'll continue to say that we feel confident the direction this is going. We see more and more members come on board. A lot of the changes that were made make the bill not only better but garner greater support. So we feel very good about it.\nQ: On North Korea, today the President told Bloomberg he was open to meeting with Kim Jong-un if the conditions were right. How does the President define the right condition to have this meeting?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's a lot of things that go along with that, and that's the key thing. \"Under the right circumstances\" was, I believe, the phrase he used. And I think that is something in keeping with our -- consistent with the policy expressed by Secretary Tillerson as well.\nWe've got to see their provocative behavior ratcheted down immediately. There's a lot of conditions that I think would have to happen with respect to its behavior and to show signs of good faith. Clearly, conditions are not there right now, but I think the President has made it clear, as Secretary Tillerson had the other day, that if the conditions, if the circumstances present themselves we'll be prepared to, but they're clearly not at this time.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Picking up on healthcare, it's believed possibly that you might be down -- Republicans might be down to maybe just a handful of votes away. Here we are at 2:00 p.m. Monday afternoon. Is this the closest that you think you've gotten? I know you don't want to talk about timelines, but is this as close to maybe getting to that magic 216 number that you've talked about?\nMR. SPICER: Well, sure. We're not going to -- once we get 216 we'll stop counting. And I think the Speaker gets that. But as I mentioned to Trey, I mean, we're getting closer and closer every day, so I would assume that today we're closer than we were a week ago. But we're not there yet, and that decision is going to be wholly within the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the Whip to let us know when they're going to open that vote up.\nQ: Dodd-Frank -- the President just gave an interview in which he said, \"I am looking at that right now.\" He goes on to say \"There's some people that want to go back to the old system, right, so we're going to look at that,\" meaning potentially breaking up the banks. So breaking up the banks, going back to Glass-Steagall, is that something that he's just looking at, or is that something that is a preference of his at this point?\nMR. SPICER: I think I mentioned in the opening, he's looking at a 21st century Glass-Steagall. That is something that we've talked about at the beginning. He mentioned this on the campaign trail. It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody, but it is something that is currently being looked at.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. So you're saying that you're not confident that the votes are lined up behind the healthcare bill. So this morning when Gary Cohn said that the bill was ready to be brought to the floor, did Gary Cohn misspeak?\nMR. SPICER: No, I just -- I would never want to get in front of the Speaker. That's up to them. We have a good whip count. I think we feel very good about where we are and where it's headed. But ultimately, the Speaker and the House leadership determine when to call a vote. I think that we know that when the vote gets called we'll feel confident that it's going to be able to pass.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President on the campaign trail raised alarm about federal debt and deficits. His spending bill get us through the end of the fiscal year doesn't include any of the offsets really that the President requested in this year's budget. Is the President -- will the President sign this agreement that does increase the federal deficit?\nMR. SPICER: I think we got a number of the President's priorities included in the CR. When we are at the final point the President will make a decision, but right now, he's pleased to see the plus-up for the military, he's pleased to see a down payment on border security, he's pleased about the D.C. opportunities scholarships. There's a lot that he's pleased in.\nAnd I think, again, as I mentioned to John, we're getting a shot at the 2017 funding, which should have been done last year.\nQ: He called for keeping that balance, essentially keeping --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think that, obviously, this is something that required 60 votes in the Senate. We couldn't have our entire way on this. But we're five months away from having a 2018 budget, and I think the President's priorities will be reflected much more in that.\nAnnie.\nQ: On President Duterte, he made comments when asked about press freedom, he said that journalists are not exempt from assassination. Did the President know about those comments and about his record on human rights when he extended the invitation for him to visit the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, the President gets fully briefed on the leaders that he's speaking to, obviously. But the number-one concern of this President is to make sure that we do everything we can to protect our people, and specifically, to economically and diplomatically isolate North Korea. And I think when you look at what he is doing in terms of building that coalition of countries in that region to do it, I think this is hopefully going to have -- well, he knows -- I'm not going to tell you every single thing that's in his brief, but he's well aware of -- when he speaks with a leader, he gets briefed on a lot about their -- what they're doing, what they've done. That's all part of the brief.\nLaura.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about the future of Sebastian Gorka. Can you tell us why he's leaving the White House?\nMR. SPICER: There is no personnel announcement at the time. I have no belief that he is currently leaving the White House, so there's nothing to update you on with respect to that, and we wouldn't comment on personnel matters at this time.\nMara.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have a healthcare and Israel question. On healthcare, when the President talks about a guarantee for preexisting conditions, current law says insurance companies have to sell to people with preexisting conditions, and they can't charge them more than someone else in that area. Is that the guarantee that the President wants?\nMR. SPICER: So the bill does not remove Obamacare's guaranteed issue requirement. That's it. And on the community ratings, the bill would allow states to waive Obamacare's community rating requirement if certain conditions designated to preserve access to coverage for people with preexisting conditions are met. And there are reduced average premiums, increased enrollment, stabilize the market, stabilize premiums for those with preexisting -- the bottom line is to try to give the states flexibility to actually get that premium down.\nQ: Right, but people with preexisting conditions would continue to get access but not at the same price as other people.\nMR. SPICER: Well, the idea is actually they would create a high-risk pool. The idea is actually to create a system where it gets the premium down for them as well.\nQ: Right. But high-risk pools could still charge them much more.\nMR. SPICER: You can't -- you're right. When I say the whole goal of this is to give the states the flexibility to get lower premiums, that's the goal all around, is to make sure that the system that we employ gets it down.\nQ: The President turned to Bibi Netanyahu at that press conference and famously said, settlements are not helpful. Israel is going to build 15,000 new homes in East Jerusalem. Does he think that Netanyahu is snubbing him?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure that we'll continue to have conversations with the Prime Minister and --\nQ: Is he aware of that?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- that will be something that President will continue to discuss.\nJohn. Two Johns --\nQ: Let me go first, John Gizzi. All right, sound good?\nMR. SPICER: That's quite a negotiation. (Laughter.) We may need you.\nQ: From \"The Art of the Deal.\"\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I wanted to ask about some news the President made this morning in an interview that he conducted with Bloomberg. In that interview, he talked about the possibility of raising gas taxes to pay for infrastructure spending. Of course, the President has put forward the idea of a trillion-dollar infrastructure spending plan. Can you talk a little bit more about this possibility of raising gas taxes?\nMR. SPICER: So what the President said during that interview is that folks from the industry had come to him and expressed to him how the deteriorating roads were affecting their ability to deliver goods and services throughout this country, and that they had expressed a willingness to see something like that as a way to help pay for and repair the roads and bridges, and that he said that he, out of respect, would definitely listen to them and consider it.\nQ: As it relates to this idea that the gas tax in America hasn't been raised for some time, what makes the President believe that now is the time that Republicans who have been opposed to this idea would be open to this idea?\nMR. SPICER: I think you're missing the -- he did not express support for it. He expressed that a group that had met with him expressed support with it, and that he, out of respect, would consider their request. That's it. There was no endorsement of it or support for it. He was just relaying what another industry group had shared with him about how to pay for the roads and bridges that need to be repaired and the impact that deteriorating roads and bridges are having on their ability to operate and to deliver goods and services, and, frankly, the cost that it is having on their trucks, on their infrastructure.\nQ: You have not foreclosed this possibility of raising --\nMR. SPICER: People ask the President all the time, please consider the following policy, and he has an open mind. I mean, there are people on both sides of the aisle, different backgrounds, that come in to see the President and ask him, could you please consider this, will you keep an open mind on it? And I think that's, frankly, what the President was doing.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Thank you, John. (Laughter.)\nQ: And thank you, John.\nQ: I have two questions, one foreign policy and one on domestic politics. First, last Wednesday, the Kremlin outlawed the Open Russia movement, the premier opposition group to the ruling regime in Russia. And the following day, security forces were forcibly closing down Open Russia's office in Moscow and other places. Does the administration have a statement on this?\nMR. SPICER: I do not. I would refer you to the State Department.\nQ: All right. My second question is, on Sunday, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a 14-term veteran of the House, past Chairman of the House, foreign affairs committee, announced her retirement. Her statement comes on the heels of a similar announcement by Congressman Chaffetz, and before that, only a few weeks ago, Lynn Jenkins of Kansas. That's three respected Republican House members all calling it quits. Is the President concerned about the number of Republican House members who do not want to be on the ballot next time and are leaving Congress?\nMR. SPICER: No. And respectfully, I would say that there are two groups of folks. I mean, in the Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, I think she's been here 35 years and she --\nQ: Twenty-eight.\nMR. SPICER: Twenty-eight. And so she's just decided it's time to retire. In the case of Congressman Chaffetz, he announced that -- you know. That doesn't -- I don't think that there's any belief that you have to stay here for 20, 30, 40, 50 years. There's always going to be churn between election cycles between members in both parties who decide, for a number of reasons, to go back home. And I think that's a healthy part of the democracy and that's, frankly, something that our framers saw. And it's a citizen legislature, so to some degree, that's a healthy part of it. But we feel very confident about where we stand.\nJennifer.\nQ: Sean, the President opted not to continue Obama's tradition of holding an Easter prayer breakfast, but he is holding a National Day of Prayer event. Was that a scheduling issue, or did he think -- what was the thought process there?\nMR. SPICER: I really don't know. I know that we wanted to do this National Prayer Breakfast this Sunday, and I think that you're going to see a lot of folks represented. I don't know enough about Obama's thing, how far back it went. Each President is going to have their own traditions, and I think this is one that the President -- you know, that morning after you've got the Easter Egg Roll and there's a lot going on. This is his way of starting a tradition here at this White House to bring faith leaders from a variety of backgrounds here to the White House.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Back to Glass-Steagall for a second. As you can imagine, the President's comments today are getting a lot of attention on Wall Street, so can we be just very clear about this -- does the President favor breaking up the big banks?\nMR. SPICER: I think he talked about, on the campaign trail and he's mentioned it before, this idea of a 21st century Glass-Steagall, a modernization of it. And we're not at a point where we're ready to roll out details of that yet. This is something, as the President said in that interview, he is actively looking at options and considering things. We're not in a position to make any announcements on this at this time.\nQ: -- take any steps toward that behind the scenes that we're not aware of?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, he's obviously been briefed by his advisors. Secretary Mnuchin and others have given him ideas and thoughts to ponder. We have nothing to announce at this time.\nTodd.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. So the lack of border wall funding raises a question of just how serious the President is about getting the border wall constructed. Is it not urgent? Is it not an emergency anymore to build this barrier? What is the timetable and deadline that he has in mind?\nMR. SPICER: Well, make no mistake, the wall is going to be built. The President has made it very clear. We have five months left in this fiscal year. We're getting $1.52 billion for border security. There's a lot that can be done with that. We've got a lot of things that happen before the wall is built in terms of planning, technology, gates. There is a lot of things they can do to prepare for that wall being constructed.\nOur big -- this was a down payment for 2017. And as we get ready for Fiscal Year 2018 -- that will start in the beginning of October -- this will be a major priority.\nQ: So it will be built. Is there a time certain? Is there a deadline by the 2018? By?\nMR. SPICER: That it will be completed? I know the President wants it done as quick as possible. There have been bids that have been put out. Part of what the Homeland Security Department is reviewing now are not just the costs, but the timetable for a lot of that. So as we move through the planning phase, that's definitely going to be part of the consideration. But obviously, the President wants this done as soon as possible.\nJonathan.\nQ: Coming back to North Korea, the President didn't just say he would be open to meeting with Kim Jong-un under the right circumstances. He said he would be \"honored\" to meet with him. This is somebody who has starved his own people, somebody who has threatened to destroy the United States. Just last week he put out a video showing the Capitol getting destroyed by North Korea fighters. How could he be \"honored\" to meet with Kim Jong-un?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the President understands the threat that North Korea poses, and he will do whatever is necessary under the right circumstances to protect our country from the threat that they pose, so --\nQ: How could that be an honor?\nMR. SPICER: I guess because he's still a head of state. So it is sort of -- there is a diplomatic piece to this. But the bottom line is the President is going to do what he has to do. Right now he's building a coalition in the region to isolate North Korea both economically and diplomatically to get the threat -- to take that threat down. And so -- but that is his number-one priority right now, is protecting this country and our people.\nQ: What did he mean when he called him one smart cookie or a pretty smart cookie?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think his point was -- he went over this in the interview -- that he assumed power at a young age when his father passed away. And there was a lot of potential threats that could have come his way, and he's obviously managed to lead a country forward. Despite the obvious concerns that we and so many other people have, he is a young person to be leading a country with nuclear weapons. And so that set aside, I think the President recognizes the threat that he poses and is doing everything he can to isolate that threat and to make sure that we bring stability to the region.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, on North Korea and then on Philippines. On North Korea, both of the President's comment on Kim Jong-un and what Secretary Tillerson said, you seem to be making the offer that we could have direct talks with North Korea. Who is going to be leading those?\nMR. SPICER: No, no -- I just -- again, I think --\nQ: Is that the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the key part of the President's statement was \"under the right circumstances,\" and that is the key. And those circumstances do not exist now. This is consistent with what Secretary Tillerson said the other day. But I think that if North Korea continues down a degree of provocative behavior, then those circumstances will never be there. But we want to hold out the possibility that if North Korea were ever serious about completely dismantling its nuclear capability and taking away the threat that they pose both to the region and to us that there is always going to be a possibility of that occurring. That possibility is not there at this time.\nQ: But who would lead that? Is that the White House or the State Department?\nMR. SPICER: We're not -- we're so far away from that possibility existing to start identifying an individual would be highly premature.\nQ: And on the Philippines, when you have been asked about President Duterte and his human rights record, you continue to say the effort here is to isolate the Philippines from the North Korea, part of this coalition to isolate North Korea.\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's also to build a -- yes.\nQ: Are you suggesting that the Philippines has some sort of an appropriate contact with North Korea? Are you suggesting that we are requesting greater access perhaps to their military bases? What is it exactly --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's an economic piece to this, as well. And I'm not going to go into -- that's part of the reason that I think the President wants to meet with him. And I'm not going to get ahead of their discussions. But I would suggest to you that there are multifaceted ways and areas in which not just the Philippines but other countries in the region can help play a role both economically, diplomatically, and otherwise to help deter the threat that they pose.\nQ: Are you suggesting now that they are trading or conducting some kind of financial transactions --\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not -- like I said --\nQ: When you say economic piece, that's what I just want to clarify --\nMR. SPICER: Right. And again, I'm just going to let -- the President will have an opportunity to speak with him about those objectives. At this time I'm not going to get ahead of that discussion.\nGlenn.\nQ: Sean, two quick, related questions. First of all, you just described Kim Jong-un as somebody who led his country forward at an early age. The President has invited Duterte, who, as Annie pointed out, has talked about assassinating journalists. The President put out a statement after Erdogan won his referendum congratulating him. He said kind things about Putin during the campaign, said kind things about Saddam Hussein. Does the President have a thing with these totalitarian leaders? Does he admire something about the way these guys conduct themselves?\nMR. SPICER: The President clearly, as I've said, understands the threat the North Korea poses. Having someone with the potential nuclear capability to strike another country and potentially our country as some point in the future is something the President takes very seriously. And so the idea that he is doing everything diplomatically, economically, and militarily to consider every way to prevent that threat from taking on the United States is something --\nQ: What about this whole package --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. Unfortunately, those are the neighbors. There are certain things -- those are the countries in the region. Those are the countries that can be helpful as we move forward to try to prevent the threat that they pose.\nQ: One follow-up question. On Sunday, Chief of Staff Priebus, talking to this gentleman right here, said, with respect to the libel laws and the First Amendment, talking about news outlets that printed false articles, \"I think it's something that we've looked at. How that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story.\"\nIs that a project that is currently being worked on by the counsel's office? Can you just tell me the status of that? Who is pursuing that?\nMR. SPICER: I think the Chief of Staff made it very clear that it's something that is being looked into substantively and then both logistically how it would happen. But that's nothing new. It's something the President talked about on the campaign trail.\nQ: Is the counsel actually investigating this?\nMR. SPICER: I will not go into it. But I'll just tell you that --\nQ: Sean, two questions. One on -- just to clarify on North Korea, were those conditions that you laid out to the earlier question, are those the conditions that would have to be met before there was any meeting -- i.e. that North Korea would have to agree to totally disarm its nuclear program, stop threatening their neighbors? Are those the conditions?\nMR. SPICER: I think those are some of the conditions. There's going to be a whole host of ones that we determine, that the State Department determines in consultation with the President that have to be met.\nAs I mentioned, we are so early into this process that I don't see this happening anytime soon. But I think that, as the President said, under the right circumstances. Those circumstances aren't present today, and there would have to be significant change for that to even be a possibility.\nQ: Sean, on a separate subject. The chief executives of United Airlines will be on the Hill tomorrow. Is the President at all -- does the President think that Congress should pass any laws after the incident last month where the passenger was dragged off? Should there be some -- should there be more done to protect passengers on airplanes from those type of incidents?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's two things. One is I think the industries probably need to -- and have -- said that they have taken a look at how they're handling a number of issues within that, both in terms of compensation, how they're handling passengers who are on planes. So there's an industry component, and then I'll leave it up to Congress to decide whether or not it's appropriate to address it legislatively. Once there was a piece of legislation, then we could -- we would have an opportunity to weigh in on that.\nCecilia.\nQ: Thanks. I just want to ask you to clarify something else the President said. He said, \"I don't stand by anything.\" How is the American public supposed to digest that, supposed to trust what the President says when he himself says of his own comments \"I don't stand by anything\"?\nMR. SPICER: What are you referring to?\nQ: Just in this CBS interview with John Dickerson in the Oval Office.\nMR. SPICER: I'm just -- I need more context.\nQ: About wiretapping.\nQ: It was about wiretapping. He was asked to -- if he still believes President Obama is a bad or evil guy, do you still stand by those comments, and the President said \"I don't stand by anything.\"\nMR. SPICER: No, that was a long back-and-forth exchange. That's why I'm asking for the context. But I think the point is he clearly stands by that. That's something that he made very clear, if you look at the entire back-and-forth.\nQ: Sean, I have two questions on the Philippines. First, is President Trump comfortable with the leader's support of extrajudicial killings of drug users in the country?\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, there's a human rights component that goes into all of this, and so it's a balance. We want to make sure that our country, our people are protected. This isn't a simple yes-or-no kind of situation. You've got a country in North Korea that possess a nuclear weapon and is looking for the appropriate delivery system to potentially do harm.\nI think the President recognizes that the number-one priority is the protection of our people, the safety of our people, and the safety of the people in the region. And so it's not just a question of either/or, it's a question of priorities and balance.\nThere's a lot that the President talks to these leaders in private about, and I think you saw that case in Egypt where sometimes that kind of diplomacy, privately talking about them and building a relationship, can achieve results not just for our people, but for their people, and discussing how -- the human rights issues. But I think that it would be a mistake to assume that the President, because we don't put out statements publicly chastising leaders at every call, means that the President is not --\nQ: But what --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, let me answer the question. I think the President understands the value, but he understands the balance. And the reason that the President is building an effective coalition and is getting results around the globe in reasserting America's place is because he understands the type of diplomacy and the type of negotiating and the type of deal-making that actually gets real results for our country. So I think it's not a balancing -- it's a balancing act, but the President is getting real results.\nQ: Sean, I have a second question, if you don't mind.\nMR. SPICER: Okay.\nQ: Looking at -- there are three open patents with the Philippines government, one from Trump trying to get the Trump patented to -- from Ivanka Trump for her clothing line. How do you respond to concerns about potential conflicts of interest with the leader of the Philippines?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President and Ivanka have done everything in compliance -- made it very clear. And I would refer you to the Trump Organization.\nCheryl.\nQ: I just want to clarify something you said to Zeke. Is there a possibility that the President would not sign this spending agreement?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, he's very pleased with the priorities, but I just want to -- let's wait until it's presented to him. But he's obviously very pleased with how his priorities were addressed in the CR, and I have every expectation that he would sign it. But let's just -- let's wait until it's on his desk.\nQ: Are you still on track to issue the full fiscal year '18 budget? Is it mid-May, or do you have a date for that?\nMR. SPICER: My understanding was it was still mid-May, but I'd want to consult with Director Mulvaney first.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Just wanted to first ask what your expectation and what's your hope for the meeting with President Abbas on Wednesday? And secondly, is the President still considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and will that be discussed?\nMR. SPICER: That is still being discussed by staff. And then what was the first question? I'm sorry.\nQ: Abbas.\nQ: The first question is your expectations going forward. What's the hope from this.\nMR. SPICER: The President's ultimate goal is to establish peace in the region. And so I think he's going to -- that's obviously the goal and the discussion that he's going to have with the head of the Palestinian Authority. But that's going to be a relationship that he continues to work on and build with the ultimate goal that there's peace in that region between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, quick follow-up on infrastructure. The President has been talking about a major infrastructure package for more than a year and in the campaign, but it doesn't seem very clear right now what the mechanism is for the construction of whatever it is that he wants to push forward. He talked about maybe attaching it to the reconciliation package for healthcare. He talked about maybe doing that with the tax package. Can you update us on -- is that still very preliminary in its invention? Does he have clear ideas? And what's the mechanism and timing to get that done?\nMR. SPICER: I think he does. He's been working on that with his both economic and policy team. But this week we're a little busy with the CR and healthcare. He laid out the tax package last week. But it is clearly still up there on the priority list. Let's get through this week -- and then hopefully have some additional details moving forward. But he has been very clear that infrastructure package is something that he wants to get done and get moving.\nQ: This year?\nMR. SPICER: This year? Oh, absolutely. And it's just a question of when he wants to announce it. But I think for this week, we're pretty focused on getting the government funded for the last five months of 2017 and getting the -- and getting healthcare done as soon as we can.\nSo with that, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great day. Thank you.\nEND 2:34 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-01", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

Pretty well-known guy too, huh? [Laughter] Congratulations, Cam, for leading the Independent Community Bankers of America. And thank you for all being here today. Very, very special.\nIt's also a very special place, isn't it? When they say, how about coming to the White House, usually about 130 percent—we try and find, who are the extras that are coming? We always have to be careful. But it's a great place.\nI also want to thank our Small Business Administrator, Linda McMahon. Where's Linda? Is she around someplace? Linda McMahon. Yes, thank you. Where? Thanks, Linda, for joining us today. She's doing an incredible job helping small businesses just like you. Or, some of you, I know you, you're not that small. I hate to tell you, you're not small. A lot of people would like to be small, right, Cam? They'd like to be small like these small-business people. But they're great people, employ a lot of people, and what they do through community development is amazing.\nCommunity banks are the backbone of small business in America. Many of you are the reason that young families can purchase their first homes, farmers can buy their next tractor, and entrepreneurs can open up their first business, creating many, many new jobs in our country. So true—community banks. Over half of the small business and loans going to small business—and it's really a substantial number higher than that—come from their community banker. You provide critical access to capital, especially for the rural communities.\nThat's why, in the first 100 days, I have taken action to roll back burdensome regulations that undermine community banks, especially—I know you're going to be very disappointed at this—Dodd-Frank, right? [Applause] No, it's out of control.\nAnd by the way, not only for community banks, for banks period. We can take community out of that one, right? [Laughter] No, Dodd-Frank, we're working on that right now and you'll see a very big difference, because you want to get out and make our country work properly.\nI've directed my administration to provide regulatory reform and relief so that those rules don't shut down community banks—which have been shutting down—and small businesses and put them on a competitive disadvantage against the larger institutions. That's what it's done. It's really made you and given you such a tremendous competitive disadvantage. I have friends that are community bankers, and they've gone through hell over the last long period of time. It's really a much longer period of time than people would understand.\nI've also directed Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to review damaging Dodd-Frank regulations that encourage risky behavior from Wall Street. Everybody knows what that means. We're also working to achieve tax reform and dramatically lower taxes on businesses and the middle class. We're proposing one of the largest tax cuts in history, even larger than that of President Ronald Reagan. Our tax cut is bigger. [Applause] Bigger.\nMy administration is committed to working with each and every one of you to help Americans achieve their financial dreams so that—look, we're all here for the same thing. You know, we have a statement. It's really—I like it much better than even your hat—it says, \"Make America Great Again,\" and that's what we all want, right? We want to all make it great again, and that's what's going to happen.\nSo I want to thank you all for being here. Very, very special people. You do a very, very special job, and the community really understands it. I know community bankers are the most popular person in their community, and they've built communities, and they've really been so badly hurt over the last number of years.\nSo we're going to change that. We're going to change regulations. We're going to give the incentives back, and you're going to grow and thrive and prosper. And maybe even more importantly, you're going to have businesses all over the country growing and thriving and prospering.\nSo I want to thank you for being here. It's a great honor. And you will see things happening like you've never seen before. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-05-01", "title": "Remarks to the Independent Community Bankers Association"}

Nearly 10 million Americans suffer from a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Unfortunately, approximately 60 percent of adults and 50 percent of adolescents with mental illness do not get the treatment or other services they need. As a result, instead of receiving ongoing expert psychiatric care, these individuals often find themselves in emergency rooms, prisons, or living on the streets.\nThis month, and for the course of my Administration, I am committed to working with the Department of Health and Human Services, States, and communities throughout the country to find a better answer for the millions of Americans who need mental health services and their families. We must further empower States, law enforcement, first responders, doctors, and families to help those with the most severe mental illnesses; to ensure that people with mental illness have access to evidence-based treatment and services; and to fight the stigma associated with mental illness, which can prevent people from seeking care. We must also resolve to enhance our understanding of mental illness and its relationship to other complex societal challenges, including homelessness, substance abuse, and suicide; and we reaffirm our commitment to improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through innovative medical strategies.\nAddressing substance abuse, addiction, and overdose is often critical to improving mental health outcomes. An estimated 8.1 million adults in America suffering with a mental illness also struggle with substance abuse. Many of those who struggled with both were among the 52,000 people in our country who died from a drug overdose in 2015. Approximately 44,000 Americans took their own lives in the past year, a preventable tragedy that frequently correlates with mental illness and substance abuse.\nOn May 4, 2017, my Administration, along with more than 160 organizations and 1,100 communities, will commemorate National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day. At this national event, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price will give special recognition awards to Awareness Day Honorary Chairpersons and United States Olympic champions Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt for speaking openly about their behavioral health challenges and for encouraging young Americans to lead healthy lives. The event will help promote the importance of National Mental Health Awareness Month, providing Americans with resources related to treatment and services for mental health and substance abuse.\nNo American should suffer in silence and solitude. During Mental Health Awareness Month, I encourage all Americans to seek to better understand mental illness and to look for opportunities to help those with mental health issues. We must support those in need and remain committed to hope and healing. Through compassion and committed action, we will enrich the spirit of the American people and improve the well-being of our Nation. Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illness, raise awareness of mental health conditions through appropriate programs and activities, and commit our Nation to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Eisenhower first commemorated it in 1958, and reflect upon our great heritage of liberty, justice, and equality. Our Founders risked their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor in defense of these values. More than 240 years ago, they set pen to paper and declared to the world \"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The Declaration of Independence thus set our Nation on its revolutionary and transformative path to protecting people's inherent, individual rights and liberties from the tyranny of an elite few who might use the powers of the state to trample upon them.\nTo protect the values for which they fought, the Framers of our Constitution created a government of limited and separated powers that enables the rule of law to prevail over the whims of government officials. As the great Justice Antonin Scalia frequently observed, every dictatorship has a bill of rights, but paper rights alone will not preserve liberty. It is our Constitution's clear division of the sovereign's power—vesting the power to create laws in the Congress, the power to execute laws in the President, and the power to interpret laws in an independent judiciary—that enables us to remain free and in control of our government.\nRecognizing, as President Ronald Reagan did, that \"freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,\" today we pay tribute to the government of laws, and not of men, that forms the foundation of our freedom. Therefore, on this Law Day, we rededicate ourselves to the rule of law, to the separation of powers, and, in the words of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the preservation of \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2017, as Law Day, U.S.A. I urge all Americans, including government officials, to observe this day by reflecting upon the importance of the rule of law in our Nation and displaying the flag of the United States in support of this national observance.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123946", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Thank you all for being here. And on behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. (Applause.)\nI bring greetings from the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And on behalf of President Trump, just a few minutes ago, I had the distinct honor to wish a happy Independence Day to Prime Minister Netanyahu over the phone as we celebrate the 69th anniversary of the independence of America's most cherished ally, the Jewish state of Israel. (Applause.)\nI want to thank all the distinguished guests who are here and members of Congress who made time to come to the White House this afternoon, and people representing a broad spectrum of Americans who all cherish the relationship that the American people have enjoyed throughout these 69 years with the people of Israel.\nIt's humbling to be here with you on this remarkable and even a hallowed day. From Secretary Steve Mnuchin to Ambassador David Friedman -- (applause) -- to Senator Orrin Hatch, who has been a great, great champion for Israel all these many years in the United States Senate. (Applause.)\nDistinguished members of Congress, including Congressman Peter King, who's with us today. (Applause.) Republicans and Democrats who are gathered here, honored guests, my fellow friends of Israel, thank you, on behalf of the President of the United States. Just thank you for being here today at the White House to celebrate this day, the anniversary of a moment that will be remembered for eternity.\nYou're all here, all of you, regardless of your home, your creed, because on this day, the fifth day in the month of Iyar in the Hebrew calendar in 1948, nothing short of a miracle occurred. On that day, in the ancient and eternal homeland of the Jewish people, the state of Israel was reborn. (Applause.)\nOn that day, the Jewish people's 2000-year exile, the longest exile of any people anywhere, ended. And on that day, a prophecy literally came to pass. And I believe in my heart that God himself fulfilled his promise to his people. The Lord God tells us in the Old Book, \"Behold, I will cause breath to enter into and ye shall live.\" And Israel lives today. (Applause.)\nToday and every day, the state of Israel and her people bear witness to God's faithfulness as well as their own. How unlikely was Israel's birth? How much more unlikely has been her survival? And how confounding against all odds, both past and present, has been her thriving. Since the moment of their independence, the Israeli people have awed the world with their strength of will, and their strength of character. They've turned the desert into a garden, scarcity into plenty. And people of Israel have turned hope into a future of security and prosperity.\nAnd at all times, in war and in peace, the people of Israel and the Jewish people have held their heads high. Every day, Israel takes the curses and slanders of too much of the world and turns them into blessings. The dignity of the people of Israel rebukes all who condemn them, not for what they do wrong, but they condemn them for what they do right.\nAnd under President Donald Trump, let me assure you of this -- if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this: America stands with Israel. (Applause.) President Trump stands with Israel for the same reason that every freedom-loving American stands with Israel -- because her cause is our cause. Her values are our values. And her fight is our fight.\nAnd President Donald Trump is a lifelong friend and supporter of the state of Israel and its people. You know, I've seen firsthand the President's deep affection for Israel and all who cherish her, and so has the world. Just last week, President Trump stood with Holocaust survivors during the National Days of Remembrance. And he declared, \"I will always stand with the Jewish people, and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the state of Israel.\" (Applause.)\nFor my part, my Christian faith compels me to cherish Israel as well as our deep alliance and historical ties. The songs of the land of the people of Israel were the anthems of my youth when I was growing up. You know, my wife and I had the privilege of visiting Israel in 2004 and 2008, and we fulfilled a lifelong dream to bring all of our children to the Holy Land in December of 2014. It was a joy -- inexpressible.\nSo let me say with confidence to all who are gathered here: President Trump stands without apology for Israel, and he always will. (Applause.)\nJust look at the actions our President has taken since he took office. The President named David Friedman to represent the United States of America in Israel. (Applause.) The President named Governor Nikki Haley to be America's Ambassador to the United Nations. (Applause.) And the President of the United States, as we speak, is giving serious consideration into moving the American embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Applause.)\nTo be clear, the President has also personally committed to resolving the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. Even now, we're making valuable progress toward the noble goal of peace. Thanks to the President's tireless leadership, momentum is building and goodwill is growing. And that while there will undoubtedly have to be compromises, you can rest assured President Donald Trump will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish State of Israel -- not now, not ever. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has made it clear America stands alongside Israel, as friends and as allies, as together we confront those enemies who threaten our people and all that we hold dear. Since the moment of their nation's birth, there's hardly been a day when the people of Israel have not lived without war or the fear of war, or the grim reality of terror. Know today that our prayers for the safety of the people of Israel, each and every day, go from the hearts of the American people to heaven. And know that Israel does not stand alone.\nToday, under President Donald Trump, America's support for Israel's security is at record levels. (Applause.) And in President Trump, America has a leader who will call our enemies by their name. I want to promise you, as the fight even goes on now in precincts around Mosul and Iraq, even in northern Syria and Afghanistan, this President is determined to keep his promise to the American people. ISIS is on the run, and we will hunt down and destroy ISIS and terrorist organizations at their source so they no longer threaten our people, our allies, and our most cherished ally, Israel. (Applause.)\nAnd under President Donald Trump, America will stand strong in the face of the leading state sponsor of terrorism. This administration has put Iran on notice. America will no longer tolerate Iran's efforts to destabilize the region and jeopardize Israel's security. Under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. (Applause.) This is our solemn promise to you, to Israel, and to the world.\nHistory attests that enmity toward the Jewish people often turns from evil thought to evil action. The State of Israel bears witness to this truth. On this day, so many years ago, only three years after the horrors of the Holocaust, Israel was given life by a people who had looked into the eye of the angel of death. The Jewish people have persevered through history's darkest hour, for in that darkness shine the light of faith, of hope, and of love.\nIt was faith that led the Jewish people to return to their ancient homeland. It was hope that spurred them to strive with all their strength for a brighter future. And it was love for each other, and a love for freedom, that has inspired the Jewish people to greatness at the hour of Israel's birth and every hour since.\nAnd so today we celebrate and we marvel at all that Israel and her people have accomplished. We praise their vigilance and resolve in the face of crisis and condemnation, and for their enduring courage in this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats. And today we remember the sacrifice of those who gave so much for Israel's existence, and for those brave men and women who stand sentry at this very hour.\nIsrael is an eternal testament to the undying fortitude of the Jewish people, to the unfathomable power of human freedom, and to the unending faithfulness of God. Indeed, though Israel was built by human hands, it's impossible not to sense that just beneath their history lies the hand of heaven. For as God tells us in his word, speaking to his people so long ago, \"I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\"\nI believe these words are as true today as they were in millennia past. And so I say with confidence, with your help, with God's help, through the strength and courage of the people of Israel and all who cherish her, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, the best days for Israel and America are yet to come. (Applause.)\nThank you very much. May God continue to bless and protect Israel and the people, and may God bless America.

Frelinghuysen, R-NJ)\nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the House amendment to Senate amendments to H.R. 244, which contains the text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.\nThe Administration appreciates the bill's provision of much-needed funding for our military, including approximately $21 billion of the requested $30 billion additional in appropriations that the President submitted to the Congress in March 2017. These funds would accelerate the President's campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as well as support ongoing efforts to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces. By providing these funds without a corresponding increase in lower priority non-defense funding, this bill rejects the \"parity\" construct that for years has jeopardized critical increases in defense spending.\nIn total, the bill represents a $25.7 billion increase in Department of Defense funding over fiscal year (FY) 2016 levels. The bill increases end strength by adding 24,000 active-duty forces and 12,000 selected reserve forces above the previous Administration's request for FY 2017. It also invests in both near and long-term readiness, provides direct support to our warfighters through new and improved equipment, and increases pay for our troops. In FY 2018, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to increase overall defense funding by fully eliminating defense sequestration in a fiscally responsible manner.\nWhile the Administration will continue to push for additional funding to stop human and drug trafficking, interdict violent gangs and cartels, and support other enforcement priorities, the bill is a good first step, and does make available an additional $1.5 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. Further, the total funding provided for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is $18.5 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over FY 2016.\nThe Administration is also concerned that the Congress did not exercise fiscal restraint, as it failed to include responsible reductions to non-defense discretionary spending to offset higher spending elsewhere.\nThe Administration is also disappointed that this bill provides almost $300 million for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program without underlying reforms to Puerto Rico's struggling healthcare system, which, like so many aspects of the United States healthcare system, has been badly damaged by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Administration believes that any sustainable solution to Puerto Rico's dire fiscal situation must include the enactment of pro-growth policies for the island.\nThe Administration strongly supports the inclusion of the District of Columbia Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Reauthorization Act, which delivers on the President's promise to provide school choice. The Administration also supports the various provisions in the bill that continue protections for the sanctity of life and the Second Amendment.\nMore generally, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to return to regular order for the FY 2018 appropriations process, and to enacting legislation that reflects the President's priorities to keep our Nation safe and create jobs and prosperity for American workers.\nIf the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.", "timestamp": "2017-05-02", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 244 — Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017"}

You know, we're buying a lot of those under-the-radar planes. In fact, you can fly over the radar; you're still not going to detect them. They cost a lot of money, I'll tell you that. [Laughter]\nThis week, our Republican team had its own victory under the radar. That is a very important thing for the men and women of the United States military. And it's a very important thing for the people of our country. In our new budget—and it's been a very hotly contested budget because, as you know, we have to go through a long and rigorous process—but we've ended years of painful cuts to our military and just achieved a $21 billion increase in defense spending. And we didn't do any touting like the Democrats did, by the way.\nNot only did we achieve this massive and badly needed increase in defense, but we did so without having to put in place an equal increase in nondefense spending, breaking the so-called parity rule that was breaking our budget and degrading our military. And that's not happening anymore; that I can tell you with surety. So you're going to have the money we need and the equipment we need.\nThere will never be a time, I will tell you this, when we will be spending more money. We are doing the necessary money. We're going to have the finest equipment of all types—whether it's airplanes or ships or equipment in general—that we've ever had in the history of our country. We are taking care of our military, and we're not going to go back to what we were doing for the last long period of time. Our military is going to be taken care of. That I promise you. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you, folks.\nWith this major investment in the America's national defense—a core campaign promise of mine—we are at last reversing years of military cuts and showing our determination and resolve to the entire world. And believe me, the entire world is watching, and we have resolve like never, ever before. These long-awaited increases will make America more safe and more secure, and give our amazing servicemembers the tools, equipment, training, and resources they need and they very much deserve.\nTo top that, we achieved the single largest increase in border security funding in 10 years. So we have more money now for the border than we've gotten in 10 years. The Democrats didn't tell you that. They forgot. In their notes, they forgot to tell you that. [Laughter] With enough money to make a down payment on the border wall; I think they'll go back and check their papers. This includes swiftly replacing ineffective and failing fencing and walls with an unbreakable barrier. So we're putting up a lot of new walls in certain areas. We're putting up a tremendous amount of money to fix the existing structures that we have, some of which we can keep into the future. They're in good shape, but we have to bring them back to the highest level. We'll be doing that with this payment.\nAnd make no mistake, we are beginning to build the wall, and we will keep out the gang members, criminals, drug and human traffickers that threaten our citizens and that threaten our security. Any Member of Congress who opposes our plans on border security—and I know these folks didn't—is only empowering these deadly and dangerous threats. And we will not put up with it, and the public won't put up with it. This bill also includes important health care resources for our great coal miners who have not been treated well—but now they're being treated very well—and continues to make funding available so inner-city children here right in the Nation's Capital can go to the school of their choice. Choice is so important.\nAfter years of partisan bickering and gridlock, this bill is a clear win for the American people. We brought lawmakers together from both sides of the aisle to deliver a budget that funds the rebuilding of the United States military, makes historic investments in border security, and provides health care for our miners and school choice for our disadvantaged children. Very importantly, there is no long-term bailout for the insurance companies that the Democrats desperately wanted to subsidize—donors—the badly failing Obamacare.\nDo you know what a donor is, fellas? [Laughter] You'll learn when you get a little older. [Laughter] You'll learn about donors. I used to be a donor. Used to get everything I wanted.\nThis is what winning looks like, something that you folks really know a lot about. What a record. The Falcons had 10 wins and only 3 losses, a tremendous achievement. And they played tough, tough teams. And they played some teams that were slightly larger, right, Coach?\nHead Coach Troy Calhoun. Oh, yes.\nThe President. Slightly—Coach is saying, boy, they're big. But you beat them, right?\nCoach Calhoun. We did.\nThe President. You beat them. He knows how to win. Just spoke to Bob Kraft of the New England Patriots, right, and he gave you a little pep talk.\nCoach Calhoun. Yes, sir.\nThe President. And he's a big fan too. And—but we know one thing: As good as this coach is, even he says he's not replacing Belichick—is that right? [Laughter] But someplace else. You're going to stay where you are. You'd better stay right where you are, Coach, right? [Laughter] Don't let them sign him. He'd better never leave us. He'd better never leave. [Laughter]\nAnd the Falcons—not only that, but finished very strong. You ended the season with six straight victories, including a win in the Arizona Bowl, which is a big deal. Who did you beat?\nCoach Calhoun. We beat South Alabama.\nThe President. South Alabama. Good team too. But we all know the games that you're most proud of—I shouldn't say this, because I love these teams too. Should I say it?\nPlayers. Yes! Yes, sir. [Laughter]\nThe President. I thought they were great Americans, Coach. [Laughter]\nCoach Calhoun. They are.\nThe President. All right. The games they were—they beat Navy—good team. Do I have to give the score?\nCoach Calhoun. Yes!\nThe President. Beat Navy 28 to 14. And you beat West Point 31 to 12. Does anybody feel guilty that you made me do that? No? [Laughter] It's a great privilege for me for the first time to present you the Commander in Chief's Trophy, my first time. Established in 1972, the Commander in Chief's Trophy has been claimed by the Air Force Academy—this is pretty hard to understand. You did go under the radar, Coach. I mean, it's really an amazing thing. A record—listen to this—20 times. You have the record. More than any other of the service academies. Pretty amazing.\nAs the United States Air Force celebrates its 70th birthday this year, this trophy will serve as a point of pride for the Academy's cadets, graduates, and all of the members, past and present, of the United States Air Force that we love.\nI love the Air Force. I love those planes. I love buying those planes at a reduced price. I have been really negotiating—[laughter]. I have cut billions—I have to tell you this, and they can check, right, Martha?—I have cut billions and billions of dollars off plane contracts sitting here. Do they give me credit? No, but that's okay. So we can either do one of two things—we can buy more planes, or we can cut the budget. What do you want to do? She says buy more planes. [Laughter] I think you're right. Nowadays, I think you're right.\nAs proud as we are of your achievements on the field, we are even more proud of you, and all of those who attend our service academies, in general, for your distinguished service on behalf of our great Nation. Whenever an Air Force crew flies, you'll always find a powerful symbol of American strength and American prestige.\nFrom the A-10 \"Wart-Hog\"—stand up, Martha. This is what she'd fly. She said, please, please, Mr. President, order more. You think that's just a great plane, right? It does some pretty big damage, I know that. Okay, and we're working on that, okay? She loves that plane—to the F-16 \"Viper\"—not as good? Not as good. [Laughter] To the B-2 \"Spirit\"—a little different, but still, no? Pretty good, though. Our proud aircraft and airmen fill our friends—and you wouldn't believe it—with the level of confidence, and they really, truly strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. And I tell you, we have so many of those planes coming in. We have planes coming in from all different corners and all different sizes and speeds and with different capabilities. You're going to be very proud of what we're doing with the Air Force. And wherever—[applause]. Thank you. Thank you.\nAnd wherever our space and cyber airmen operate world-class systems for modern warfare, the full might of America will be on display for all to see. With the new budget increases we have achieved in our spending bill, we'll be able to purchase the greatest planes ever built, including the F-35—that is some plane—and the next generation of military aircraft. We will maintain and expand our superiority in the air and our ability to protect and project America's vital security interests.\nJust across the river, not far from the White House, stands a soaring tribute to the men and women of the United States Air Force. The three arching spires of the Air Force Memorial represent the core values of this noble branch of our Armed Forces: integrity first, service before self, excellence in all you do.\nFor 70 years, the United States Air Force has embodied those principles. I know each of you will uphold these standards with devotion and dignity throughout your military career. And I know that each of you will continue to make your country proud.\nThese are great people. I met everybody in the Oval Office. They actually said this is the first time you've been invited into the Oval Office, and actually, the New England Patriots said that last week—[laughter]—that they were not invited in. But we invite them into the Oval Office. I think we should invite them into the Oval Office, right? Don't you think? But we're very, very proud of you, Coach.\nTogether, the five branches of the United States Armed Forces—Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard—are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. And believe me, getting stronger and stronger and stronger by the day. One of the reasons that I was elected, one of the reasons that I'm standing here is called, people want their military to be strong—not weak, but strong—really strong.\nYou keep us safe, you keep us strong, and you keep us free. Thank you all for your service, and congratulations again to the winners of the Commander in Chief's Trophy, the great Air Force Falcons. Thank you. Congratulations.\nWith that, I'd like to invite Coach Troy Calhoun, a great coach—loved by his players, by the way. I said, do you love him or do you dislike him? And by the way, some coaches are pretty well disliked, but they're good coaches too. But I like this combination much better—a great coach, Troy Calhoun. And congratulations, Coach. Thank you, man.\nCoach Calhoun. Thank you. Appreciate it. Mr. President, we're overwhelmed with the graciousness of you and your staff. This certainly has been an unbelievable trip for our young men and young women that have been able to come along. And we are so proud.\nIn only 3 weeks, under your command, they will become commissioned and second lieutenants in our United States Air Force. And what they will bring is courage, integrity, boldness. And unquestionably, they're champions, but more than anything else, they're absolute winners. So, ladies and gentlemen, the young men and young women of the United States Air Force Academy.\nHey, at this time, we have a couple of mementos we'd like to leave for the President. I will say this: Our Commander in Chief, you look at our roster, we never have anybody that's ever worn jersey number one. Here in the last 9 years, I think we've got a new tenant holder who—to that spot. So, sir, I'm going to invite up Weston Steelhammer and Jacobi Owens, two our captains, to present a little gift to you.\n[At this point, the President was presented with an Air Force jersey.]\nThe President. Whoa! That's so great. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-05-02", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Commander in Chief's Trophy to the United States Air Force Academy Falcons"}

(Laughter.) But then the President decided -- when he heard you were across the hallway, he decided to come by and say hello just to tell you all how proud he is of you, how proud he is of your parents, and how proud we are to continue the D.C. scholarship program. (Applause.)\nAnd we're so grateful -- we're so grateful -- to have someone who has been so dedicated to opening doors of opportunities for American children and families all across this country for so many years as the Secretary of Education. Would you join me in thanking Betsy DeVos for her wonderful leadership? (Applause.)\nSecretary DeVos is fighting every day to give America's children the world-class education that every American child deserves. And on behalf of the President and families across America, Betsy, we thank you. We thank you. Today is just an early installment of the impact that you're having on expanding educational opportunities for all of our children.\nAnd to Tseganesh Tadele, wow. What an impressive young lady. Give her another round of applause, will you please? (Applause.) She actually rewrote a little of her speech right at the very beginning. (Laughter.) She added greetings to the Secretary, to the Vice President, and to the President, which I thought was very impressive on your feet. And congratulations on all your great success. You really are a wonderful example of why President Trump is fighting so hard to expand educational opportunities for all of our families in the country, and we thank you for being here.\nTo all the advocates, to the administrators, especially to the parents who are here -- the parents of these wonderful, beautiful children who are gathered here, to all the great teachers who are here: Welcome to the White House. You are making a difference each and every day in the lives of all these wonderful kids. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.)\nWe have here leaders and students from K-5 grade school, middle school and high school; from three private, one charter school and one public school. And we're proud to have all of you kids here. St. Anthony's Catholic School, Georgetown Visitation, Basis D.C. Charter just to name a few. And all the way from Indianapolis, Indiana, we have Thomas Carr Howe Community High School. Let's welcome all these great kids and these great schools. They all represent (inaudible). (Applause.)\nAnd all the adults here, thank you for caring so much. Thank you for caring so much about your children and every student's education. Thank you for the late nights, for the early mornings. Thank you for the everyday acts of love and sacrifice you make on behalf of these kids, giving them the best shot in life, the best future for them.\nAnd lastly, you heard the President say today again that he's proud of you. He's really proud of you, and so am I. You are America's future. You keep at it, you keep learning, you keep striving, you keep believing in your dreams. Don't ever let anybody tell you you can't. Then you will. You'll live out your dreams. And thank you for believing in your dreams and working so hard at all of your classwork today. Give these kids another round of applause. (Applause.)\nNow, we're here today because this week Congress is poised to pass legislation that President Trump will sign into law, a spending bill that will give new life and funding to the D.C. Opportunities Scholarship Program, which is the only federally funded voucher program in the country. It's a case study in school choice success.\nThis spending bill will extend the Opportunities Scholarship for three years, funds it at $45 million for the rest of the year. It is a victory for families and students throughout the District of Columbia. Since its creation in 2004, the Opportunities Scholarship program has given parents and families hope my giving them a pathway to take their children out of schools that too often are failing to meet the needs of children here in our nation's capital, give them a chance that other families have to put their children into a private school.\nAnd over the past 13 years, the results have been impressive. Nearly 20,000 students have applied for the program, 7,500 students have been accepted. And more than 1,150 children are participating in the D.C. Opportunities Scholarship program at this very moment.\nWhile only 69 percent of D.C.'s public school students graduated from high school last year, 98 percent of D.C. scholarship students walked across the stage and received their diploma last year -- 98 percent. (Applause.) And get this: 86 percent of those kids were accepted into college to continue their education and climb the ladder of success. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump could not be more proud to extend this crucial program, but his commitment to school choice doesn't end there. I have to tell you that this is a President that truly does believe that parents in America ought to be able to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or their area code. And in the days ahead, we're going to continue to work each and every day to give every family in America the opportunity to choose the school that's best for them.\nSo with thanks again to our Secretary of Education for bringing us to this moment, with thanks to all of you for all the hard work that you're putting in to all of your schoolwork today, on behalf of the President of the United States of America, we say keep dreaming, keep striving. And I have a feeling we're going to see one of these kids back at the White House. (Laughter.)\nThanks, everybody. And God bless you.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123952", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:25 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Another busy day here at the White House. As you know, the President has been talking to members of Congress the last few days about the American Health Care Act, up through this morning. The Vice President just left a bit ago to meet with some of the lawmakers on Capitol Hill about healthcare and the rest of the President's legislative agenda. The President was glad to meet this morning with Representatives Long and Upton who voiced their support for the AHCA earlier this morning.\nIt's especially important that we continue to make progress on repealing and replacing Obamacare, as rates skyrocket and insurers keep fleeing the market around the country in anticipation of this impending implosion.\nEarlier this week, Aetna announced that it will scale back its presence on Obamacare exchanges even further in 2018, withdrawing from the Iowa exchange. Aetna had already cut its participation in the exchanges from fifteen states to four in 2017. Iowa is going to be hit particularly hard by these recent developments as Medica, the last insurance for most of the state, also announced this week that it will likely stop selling individual healthcare policies in the state, which will affect tens of thousands of Americans.\nWith reports like these seemingly coming every day, it couldn't be clearer that it's time for action on healthcare. We're glad that so many members are with us, and look forward to welcoming even more on board.\nAlso, earlier today, the President dropped by an event focusing on school choice that was hosted by the Vice President and Secretary DeVos with students ranging from kindergarten to high school. Most of the students who visited the White House today are some of the thousands of local children who will benefit from the three-year extension of the D.C. School Choice scholarship secured by the President and congressional allies in the budget deal.\nThe District of Columbia's Opportunity Scholarship program, which was launched in 2004, provides vouchers to D.C. students whose family either received benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or earned less than 185 percent of the federal poverty level.\nAnd this program gets results. Last year, 69 percent of D.C. public school students graduated from high school. That's compared to an incredible 98 percent of the D.C. scholarship students who received their high school diplomas last year. Funding for the Opportunity Scholarship was one of our priorities during these budget negotiations, and the Trump administration is glad to have ensured that the program's extension was taken care of through this appropriations bill, on top of the increases in military spending and funding for border security.\nToday, the President welcomed the President of the Palestinian Authority to the White House for an official visit. The visit stemmed from a phone call the two leaders had on March 10th, when President Trump invited President Abbas to Washington so they could discuss, in person, ways to move forward on a comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe two leaders made their own statements just a little bit ago. But to give you a few additional details, some of the topics that were discussed during their meeting and the lunch were: advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace; preventing incitements to violence, particularly media outlets directly associated with the Palestinian Authority; strengthening efforts to combat terrorism, including defeating ISIS; measures to empower the Palestinian economy and provide economic opportunity for the Palestinian people. And, additionally, the President raised concerns about the payments to Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who have committed acts of terror, and to their families, and emphasized the need to resolve this issue.\nLater this evening, the President, along with the Vice President and Mrs. Pence, will host members of the White House Evangelical Advisory Board in the residence for a discussion, prayer, and dinner. The President is proud to welcome these faith leaders to the White House for the first time and thank them for their steadfast support ahead of the National Day of Prayer, which is tomorrow.\nLater tonight, the Vice President will also deliver a keynote address at the Susan B. Anthony List 2017 Campaign for Life Gala. The Vice President's office has more details on that.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. Ken.\nQ: Sean, on healthcare, does the President feel like we've reached an inflection point here with the House? Is this a make-or-break moment in terms of getting the bill through the House? And what precisely is the President doing, and what arguments is he making to members on why they should support this bill?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think he's making several points. One is that Obamacare if failing and that, as I just mentioned with that note, that with so many cases around the country, the need to have a provider is becoming greater and greater. Two is that costs are out of control. These are two basic tenets that you've heard us talk about. But I think overall the efforts that were made, and especially the effort this morning with Congressman Long and Upton, help bring more people into this effort and make it even a stronger bill, and ensure that Americans have a healthcare system that gets them the care that they need at a price that's affordable.\nQ: Is this a \"now or never\" kind of moment, though, with the bill?\nMR. SPICER: I don't want to put it there. The President has made it clear before that he's not trying to set a date for certain. Obviously, that's up to the Speaker and the House leadership to determine when that time is appropriate. But as you have seen, we continue to move closer and closer to that time, and the number of members who are supporting it continues to grow further and further, and I think that's a very promising sign.\nQ: Yesterday, the President tweeted that FBI Director James Comey gave Hillary Clinton a \"free pass\" for many bad deeds. Is the President comfortable having an FBI director that gives out free passes serve during his administration?\nMR. SPICER: The President has confidence in the director. But I think, clearly, his point was after some of the comments that were made yesterday regarding the reason for the outcome of the election, I think he just wanted to make it clear what exactly happened.\nQ: On healthcare, the President appears to be directly involved behind the scenes. How much responsibility does the President plan to take for the outcome of the vote if it does occur this week?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think if we have a vote -- which is looking greater and greater every day; but again, I'm not going to get ahead of the House leadership in deciding when that is -- my assumption is the House leaders will call that when that number will put us over the top. And I feel like -- again, you saw two votes come down today. The President has been on the phone constantly. The Vice President, the Chief of Staff, other members of the legislative affairs team calling members, talking to them, hearing their concerns. But I think we have made this an unbelievable bill and an unbelievable replacement for Obamacare, which is failing, and that's what we've sought to do from the beginning.\nQ: Sean, there was a report in Politico yesterday that seemed pretty well sourced indicating that President Trump plans to sign an executive order tomorrow in the name of religious freedom. Will the President sign a religious freedom executive order tomorrow? And will it enable discrimination against LGBT people?\nMR. SPICER: So I know we've talked about EOs for a long time -- executive orders. Tomorrow is National Day of Prayer. There will be a proclamation the President will sign. We're looking forward to having religious leaders from a multitude of backgrounds come to the White House and celebrate this day with us, but I've never gotten ahead of executive orders and I'm not going to start now.\nQ: But you can't deny that the executive order -- the President is a friend of the LGBT community. Isn't that a law?\nMR. SPICER: I answered the question. Thank you.\nQ: How can the President be a friend of the LGBT community if the President is considering this executive order?\nMR. SPICER: Blake.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I want to get the reaction to former President Obama. He tweeted yesterday after Jimmy Kimmel's monologue that went viral -- a monologue you've probably seen about his child. Kimmel talked about the need to cover preexisting conditions that need funding for the NIH. And Mr. Obama said, \"Well said, Jimmy. That's exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy.\" Your reaction to both of them would be what?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we share that concern for the Kimmels' child, as well as any child that needs care, and that's frankly why the President fought so hard to improve the bill like he did this morning, to make sure that there was that extra layer of protection for anybody with a preexisting condition, no matter their stage in life. That's why we're fighting so hard for this.\nBut I think, most importantly -- and I think at the end of Jimmy Kimmel's monologue, he said that there is no -- you know, we need to have some of these things that aren't Republican or Democrat, that they're American policies. And I think that's what the President is fighting for right now, is to make sure that we have a healthcare system that doesn't matter where you live or your background, that it takes care of people.\nWe're making sure right now -- we've talked about this endlessly over the last month or so -- but we've got a healthcare system that's not doing what it's supposed to. It's failing. It's costing people too much. It's giving people a card, not coverage. And what the President is trying to do by working with these members of Congress is to make sure that we have the strongest possible healthcare system that covers them, that gives them the care that they need, that allows them to go see a doctor, that covers preexisting conditions, and does so in a way that's not going to be out of range and unaffordable for most Americans.\nQ: And I'll ask you about what Hillary Clinton said yesterday. She said, \"If the election had been on October 27th, I would be your President.\" And on the Hill today, James Comey, testifying, said -- speaking about October 28th -- he said, \"Would you speak, or would you conceal?\" Did James Comey make the right decision on October 28th?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, I'm a Patriots fan, and I think if games ended in the third quarter, there would have been a different team here last week. But you play a game four quarters, you play an election until Election Day. So with all due respect to her, that's not how it works. You don't get to pick the day the election is on. It's set by the Constitution. The President won 306 electoral votes. And I think there's been plenty of analysis on the election and where people chose to spend their time and their resources and their messaging. And I think it's somewhat sad that we're still debating why the President won in the fashion that he did.\nQ: \"Speak or conceal\" -- did he make the correct decision?\nMR. SPICER: I think, with respect to the election, I think the American people made their decision.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There's been a lot of focus recently on Ivanka Trump's role in this White House. Can you clarify for us what exactly her areas of responsibility are here, and what her qualifications are for those responsibilities?\nMR. SPICER: Sure. I mean, I think Ivanka has built a very successful business. She's been working with women to talk about empowerment and education for quite some time. It's a passion of hers. And I think for her to bring both her business acumen and success, her passion for women empowerment and education and entrance into areas that they haven't been able to get to is one of the reasons that Chancellor Merkel reached out to her and asked her to come to the W20 Summit.\nBecause I think she can use her voice to help bring attention to issues. She can use her resources and knowledge of individuals to help break down some barriers that young women, older women face in education and business. That's where she has always had her passion. That's what she's working on now.\nQ: But what specifically are her responsibilities here? For example, The New York Times reported this morning that she has a weekly meeting with the Treasury Secretary. What's that meeting for?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that I've mentioned it. I think there's a lot of times where she's meeting with folks to understand an issue, to get up to speed. But I think her primary focus, which she has always said -- where her passion is, where her time is going to be spent -- is figuring out how to empower women, how to break down barriers for women -- whether that's in small business, in education, young women in poverty or families, and figuring out how to help them.\nBut of course, I mean, part of that is to have conversations with people in government and figure out what programs exist, where we can help additional folks using government, or fix a government program that might be not properly being utilized. But there's a lot of that.\nMatt.\nQ: Thank, Sean. Back to healthcare. An analysis from AARP showed that the sickest patients will pay nearly $26,000 a year in premiums under the new healthcare law, and that $8 billion, which was included in that amendment this morning, is not nearly enough to lower those costs. So I'm wondering, how does that, which would be a major premium hike on the sickest patients, square with the President's promise to both lower premiums and take care of those with preexisting conditions?\nMR. SPICER: So it sounds interesting to me there are so many variables that are unknown -- that to make an analysis of that level of precision, it seems almost impossible.\nQ: But --\nMR. SPICER: Well, hold on. Let me give you an example. So right now preexisting conditions are covered in the bill. They always have been. We've talked about that before. States have the right to receive a waiver. If someone has continuous coverage, that's never going to be an issue, regardless of -- no circumstance is anyone with continuous coverage would ever have a problem with preexisting conditions.\nIf someone chose not to have coverage for 63 days or more, and they were in a state that opted out, and they had a preexisting condition, and they were put into a high-risk pool, then we've allocated an additional $8 billion over five years to help drive down those costs.\nSo for someone to know how many people that is, what number of states are going to receive a waiver -- ask for it, and receive a waiver is literally impossible at this point. So to do an analysis of any level of factual basis would be literally not --\nQ: Two follow-up questions. One, would the President prefer -- does he have a preference as to whether or not states opt out, given that option? And two, yes or no, will people with preexisting conditions pay higher premiums under this bill than they currently do?\nMR. SPICER: I think everything that we've done, including the additional $8 billion this year -- everything that I've seen shows that the cost curve goes down for them in a lot of ways. So if you have preexisting conditions -- and again, remember what a small pool that is. If you have a preexisting condition currently, the bill protects you. The only factor would be if you live in a state that potentially asks for a waiver and then is subsequently granted it, and if you've gone 63 days without continuous coverage.\nSo if you have continuous coverage, if you live in a state, it'll never, ever be a factor. But the President has worked to make sure that in every single scenario -- anybody, everybody -- he has kept true to his word that preexisting conditions are covered and that the cost curve continues to bend down.\nQ: And then on the other question, the congressman, this morning, from Michigan was saying he's confident, from conversations with his governor, that his state will not ask for a waiver. Does the President have a preference as to whether or not states ask for waivers?\nMR. SPICER: The President's preference -- and I'm not -- the President believes in states' rights, number one. Number two, not just preference, his goal is to make sure, as he stated repeatedly, is that preexisting conditions are covered, care coverage goes up, and costs go down. Those are the principles that continue to guide him.\nCecilia.\nQ: Thank you. I want to go back to Director Comey on the Hill today, and some things he said about Russia. One of the things that he said was, the Russian government is still involved in American politics. Is that the view of this White House?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's the view of the FBI. I'm not --\nQ: Is that different than the White House?\nMR. SPICER: We rely on them and the rest of the intelligence community to provide the President with updates on what they're learning. So it doesn't go that way. The director and the intelligence community update the President on all of the threats that the United States faces and all of the intelligence activity that needs to be briefed.\nQ: And in that particular one, does then he accept that assessment from the FBI?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I don't know what he has briefed the President on. I'm not trying to be coy on this, but I'm just saying, like, I don't know what he recently briefed or how -- I know that the question was asked during the testimony. I don't know what new evidence, beyond what they shared with the President in the December, has happened between then and now.\nQ: Okay, and just one more thing on that front. He called Russia \"the greatest threat of any nation on Earth.\" Is that something the President agrees with?\nMR. SPICER: The President has been very clear that he thinks the threat that North Korea poses with the potential nuclear weapon that has range capacity is something that he finds to be threatening to the lives of Americans and our allies.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, I have two healthcare questions. Can I follow up on what you were saying about the President's conversation with Congressman Upton? Until yesterday, the President thought there was sufficient funding, and Congressman Upton came to him and suggested a billion dollars more. You were just saying that it's impossible to estimate what would be needed. My question is, why did the President think that there was sufficient protection for those individuals who have preexisting health conditions yesterday, but today he now believes $8 billion will cover it? What persuaded him that the number that he had embraced yesterday was not sufficient and that $8 billion is going to do it?\nMR. SPICER: So, in this particular case, Congressman Upton and I think Congressman Long addressed that he, through a series of conversations that he had with the President, shared with the President a concern that he had in their shared goal of covering preexisting conditions. The President, as Congressman Long discussed outside, expressed that -- the President expressed to him that the preexisting conditions were covered, and went through the various scenarios. Congressman Long felt as though there were scenarios in which -- potentially the high-risk pool. It wasn't a question of coverage, it was a question of cost. And so the President engaged in a conversation with them and, through some of the analysis that Congressman Upton and Congressman Long had done, the President agreed that if we add an additional safety net, which is, frankly, what that is -- not on the coverage, but on the cost -- that that could ensure that the cost curve gets further bent downward. And the President agreed.\nBecause at the end of the day -- look, the President has talked about this from the beginning, that he wants to work with members to make it the strongest possible bill, to have the strongest outcome for the American people, and a healthcare system in which both the cost continue to go down. And I think that's one point, Alexis, that we keep forgetting in this discussion with what we're trying to do. It's not just replace Obamacare. Obamacare is dying on the vine. The costs are spiraling out of control, deductibles are going up, and carriers -- again, this isn't a theoretical discussion. Aetna, as we just discussed, is pulling out of states, and counties around the country are now going down to one and, in some cases, zero choices.\nSo this isn't a question of just replacing something. We are actually at a point where if we don't do something, some people in this country will have no options for coverage. We've got to do something, and that's where the President has been willing to work with members, pick up the phone, and figure out how do we get this done to make sure that every American has got the coverage that they need.\nQ: I want to also ask about the next step. There are members of the House who are concerned on the Republican side that they could vote for something that will change dramatically in the Senate. What is the President's message to those members who are concerned about that? Is he going to press the Senate to embrace whatever may or may not come out, but you hope may come out of the House?\nMR. SPICER: Well, of course. I mean --\nQ: Would be adopted by the Senate in whole.\nMR. SPICER: I mean, I think the legislative process works -- the Senate will take up the House bill and then they'll go to conference. And then that's when both sides, again, will have an opportunity to discuss any potential changes. The President feels really good about where this bill -- how this bill has evolved, how much stronger it's become, to achieve the goals that he set out. And he'll continue to work with Leader McConnell and others when it gets to the Senate to make sure that anything -- and there could be issues that come between now and then. But our number-one goal is to get it out of the House, focus, and then have those conversations with the Senate, and then go to conference.\nBut for right now -- and in a perfect world, they would just take it straight up and we would go. But I have a feeling the Senate is going to want a say at this, so we'll go from there.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. Chairman Upton and Congressman Long were very pleased to (inaudible) floor with this legislative fix. They say they've turned their \"nos\" into \"yeses.\" Do you believe there's additional legislative fixes that are still to come before this bill actually hits the House floor?\nMR. SPICER: Look, the President always said he's willing to hear ideas. This is a question for Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy, and Congressman Scalise in terms of when is the appropriate time. If they feel that they've gotten to a place where they have the votes necessary to take it to the floor based on the number of suggestions and fixes and updates, then that will be up to them. But I'm not going to prejudge, in this case, through those conversations -- and the President has constantly been on the phone for the last several days and continues to do so, to hear members' issues and concerns. And so if there's a point -- but I think we're getting to that number closer and closer. But that will be ultimately a decision that Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy have to make.\nQ: Sean, on timing, I've heard different things from the President over the course of the past two weeks. At one point I heard the President say he wants the bill to be taken up now; other times, it's not important, just get the bill right. What's your view? Is it very important, as far as the administration is concerned, that this vote take place sooner rather than later?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, the sooner the better, right? But we don't want to put it up for a vote -- I mean, the goal is to pass it, which we continue to get closer and closer to every day. But you don't want to put it up and not move forward. So the President wants to make sure that the leadership is confident that it can pass a bill, and I think he's done everything he can in terms of speaking with members of the House to get there. But ultimately, it's going to be their decision to do it. And I think we continue to feel optimistic about the direction that we've seen the legislation go.\nMike.\nQ: I want to revisit the President's comments in his tweets about the omnibus spending bill. He campaigned on his business record, on his ability to make good deals, make better deals than politicians in the past have. Does the President view the spending bill as a good deal?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nKristen.\nQ: Sean, can you say definitively that no one with a preexisting condition will pay more under the amendment?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've done everything we can to do that. And every measure that the President has taken further not only ensures that people with preexisting conditions get covered in every scenario, but does so in a way that bends the cost curve down.\nQ: Can you guarantee it?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- with all due respect, to answer a question and say can I guarantee something -- but I can tell you that every single thing that the President has done, including the action that he took this morning to work with members of Congress, does everything by every account to bend the cost curve down, to help anybody that would potentially fall into that small group of individuals to get -- to bend the cost curve down who have preexisting conditions.\nSo the answer is, yes, that we have done every single thing possible to get that down and to ensure that, number one, that that potential is as small as possible. Because the bill covers people with preexisting conditions, number one. Number two, it does everything to ensure that if a state seeks a waiver that they are still covered. But it looks at every single possibility to ensure that people get the care that they need.\nQ: Is there a concern -- you criticized former President Obama rushing through his healthcare plan. Is this not being rushed through? This legislation hasn't even been scored yet by the CBO or put up for public debate -- this latest piece of legislation.\nMR. SPICER: Well, every piece of legislation evolves as it goes through the process. We saw that this morning. I think we had a piece that makes it an even stronger bill. But the underlying principles that we have been talking about have been something that Republicans have been talking about and have had the contours of for the last seven years. This was something that has been part of the process for a long time.\nQ: Does he expect to see a vote this week?\nMR. SPICER: The President -- I've answered this a lot of times. The President expects to see a vote when the Speaker and the Leader and the Whip call a vote because they believe they have the votes to go on.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, it looks like we're on the precipice of a vote on the omnibus spending bill. Senator Lindsey Graham said a short time ago that Republicans got their clocks cleaned on this bill. It looks like as many as 100 House Republicans will vote against it. How do you square that with the pronouncements out of this White House that this was a big win for Republicans?\nMR. SPICER: I think Director Mulvaney addressed that extensively yesterday. But to get back to Mike's point, this is a good deal -- a great deal for the President. He got $21 billion in military funding. That is a huge campaign pledge that he made very clearly to modernize and update the military. It fully funds the largest military pay raise in six years. It ends the Obama-era sequestration policy of pairing increases in domestic spending for every dollar to dollar. It got $1.52 billion in border security, which is the first installment in securing our nation's southern border. It got $1.3 billion to coalminers, which delivers on another promise that he made. There's no Obama bailout -- Obamacare bailout, those CSR payments, which was something that the Democrats wanted. There's a three-year extension of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Choice, which -- you saw the children that will benefit from that this morning. It increases funds for the opioid crisis. It eliminates, rescinds and terminates 150 programs or initiatives.\nI think when you -- and Director Mulvaney laid this out yesterday -- when you look at what the President came forward with a month or so ago and said these are my priorities, he got what he asked for. And I think that's big. So this is a -- the President feels very good about what he got.\nAnd again, I think it's important to underscore two points. Number one, in the Senate we needed 60 votes. This had to be a bipartisan action because it is a spending bill, so, therefore, we needed to get Democratic votes with us. But if you look at -- as Director Mulvaney pointed out yesterday -- it used to be a one-for-one spending increase if we wanted a military increase. We got that down from a dollar to 20 cents. That is a huge win for the President. He negotiated a fairly strong deal when it comes to what they got versus what we got.\nThe other thing that's important to understand is that this is just the final five months of FY18 [FY17]. Any President coming into office wouldn't get the first shot at a budget until the end of September of the year after they got elected. So, in theory, he got to push for his priorities -- military spending, border security, D.C. schools -- all the things I mentioned right out of the gate. And for the last five months of this fiscal year, something that should have happened during the Obama administration, he got his priorities -- a down payment on them.\nQ: Quick second topic, if I could. This is at least the fourth White House, fourth administration in a row that has come in with optimistic predictions of how Middle East peace will go. What's going to be different this time?\nMR. SPICER: I think the man is different. You look at what -- the President's diplomacy style is paying dividends, whether it's getting someone who has been held for years in Egypt released; whether it's the action that China has taken. The relationships and the foundation that the President is rebuilding are going to pay huge dividends for this country in terms of our economic interest, our national security interest. But this President's style is one to develop a personal bond with individuals. And I think you saw that today with President Abbas, him talking so kindly about the President. You saw that. The relationship that exists and is only getting stronger between him and Prime Minister Netanyahu. You have two individuals who, because of this President, are increasing their desire for peace.\nYou've got an individual in President Xi in China that has taken fairly significant action to help the -- work with the United States, especially with respect to our desire to end the threat in North Korea that has been unprecedented. The President's ability to connect with an individual, to work with them towards a shared goal, to have back-room diplomacy is something that is going to continue to pay dividends and get results for this country.\nQ: Can I follow up on John's question?\nMR. SPICER: Charlie.\nQ: In January, the President did an interview deriding the \"little toy walls\" along the southern border -- that's a quote -- and said, I don't know why they're even wasting their time. Why is the government focused so much on existing border security measures rather than fighting for the wall that he promised that he would build?\nMR. SPICER: Thank you for the opportunity to show you some things. So if I can get the first image up. (Laughter.) You asked.\nQ: Did you guys coordinate?\nMR. SPICER: No. But, you literally could not have (inaudible) on it. This is what exists right now throughout our country. This is the kind of barrier that exists throughout the country. You see a place where cars can literally create little things and drive over. You've got places that can get burrowed under. That one they've cut through. That one doesn't seem to be too effective at keeping people. Those images represent our nation's current border security.\nAccording to a GA report from earlier this year, from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015, the Customs and Border Patrol recorded a total of 9,287 breaches in pedestrian fencing at an average cost of $784 per breach to repair, right. So every time that they cut through, break through, put something over, it's costing just under a thousand bucks for us to go out and have to fix.\nNow, to the next slide. (Laughter.) You had no idea you were getting this, did you?\nSo the bill that is about to get passed, Title 6 -- which pertains to the Department of Homeland Security's funding on additional appropriation -- states that an additional $497.4 million \"for procurement, construction, and improvements.\" Of that total, $341.2 million are to -- and this is literally what it says in the bill -- \"to replace approximately 40 miles of existing primary pedestrian and vehicle border fencing along the southwest border using previously deployed and operationally effective designs such as currently deployed steel bollard designs that prioritize agent safety.\" So that's your answer, Charlie.\nQ: So --\nMR. SPICER: So hold on, hold on, let me just -- we have a porous border right now with broken fences, things that can be cut through, places that can just literally be driven over. And to replace this with a 20-foot high bollard wall will protect our country, something that the DHS has designated the most effective way to do this. So that's what we got out of this bill.\nQ: Just one question about the photos. Are those photos of fences or walls?\nMR. SPICER: That is called a bollard wall. That is called a levy wall.\nQ: So that's the wall the President promised?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no -- there are various types of walls that can be built. Under the legislation that was just passed, it allows us to do that.\nQ: What's that?\nMR. SPICER: That is called a levy wall on the left. That is called a bollard wall.\nQ: So that's not a wall, it's a levy wall?\nMR. SPICER: That's what it's actually called. That's the name of it.\nQ: He's building fencing, not a wall.\nMR. SPICER: No, no. In this current bill, it allows us to do the following. So to be clear, in several areas along our southern border we have what was in the first slide, which are areas in which someone can literally cut through with a pair of wire cutters or put a little barrier over that a car can drive over the top. Okay? What we've done is taken the tools that we have to replace -- and if you look at that one in particular, you've got a chain-link fence is what is currently at our southern border. That is literally down there now. We are able to go in there, and instead of having a chain-link fence, replace it with that bollard wall. That's what it is.\nQ: But it's not the wall the President promised?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, hold on. Hold on, Jim. We're going to take turns. But just to be clear -- because Charlie asked the same thing so I'll give you a little help on this one -- that this is the 2017 budget. This is a down payment on what the President is going to prioritize in the 2018 budget that starts October 1st.\nAnd as I mentioned to John Roberts, the idea that we even got a shot at this is something that should have been done last term under President Obama. We have an opportunity to use the last five months of the FY17 budget to get the President's priorities jumpstarted. So he is using the current bill to get his priorities moving and put it down.\nTo answer the question, it is currently being built in Naco, Arizona; Sunland Park, New Mexico; and we are going to be starting to do this in San Diego, El Paso, and Rio Grande Valley.\nQ: So you're basically just telling supporters, the President's supporters, to be satisfied with this existing tough-guy fencing until he's ready to build the wall?\nMR. SPICER: No. What I'm telling anybody is that the President said he was going to build the wall and he's doing it, and he's using the best technology and what the Department of Homeland Security, under Secretary John Kelly, says is the most effective way to keep people out, to stop drugs, to stop cartels, to stop human trafficking, and to prevent illegal immigration. That's what I'm telling you.\nQ: Mahmoud Abbas stood next to the President today and said he wants to see East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian State. Yesterday, Vice President Pence said you're still looking at moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. What is the White House view on those remarks? I mean, we didn't hear anything from President Trump in response to that.\nMR. SPICER: I think the Vice President, as you noted, commented yesterday that it's still something that is being discussed and considered by the President. It will continue to be a discussion that he has with both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. But obviously, we're not going to --\nQ: On the Palestinian --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to -- they had a series of private discussions. That is why the President is able to effectively get things done for this country is to not negotiate out in public. He's going to continue to have discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Abbas moving forward, and he feels confident about where that relationship was and developments that were made today.\nQ: He doesn't object to what President Abbas said, it's just not decided?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of not decided. I'm not going to negotiate what they are talking about in private from this podium. So that's ---\nQ: (Inaudible.) That's why I'm asking.\nMR. SPICER: I understand it. I'm just telling you that we are not going to negotiate from the podium.\nJim.\nQ: Just to follow up on the President's meeting with Abbas, he did say at one point, \"Frankly,\" talking about Middle East peace and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \"maybe it's not as difficult as people have thought.\" Why does he believe that the toughest -- arguably the toughest foreign policy challenge in our lifetime may not be as difficult as people have thought?\nMR. SPICER: I think both of these leaders have very publicly expressed the confidence they have in the President's negotiating skills, in the President's desire to work to get peace, the relationship that he's built with them individually and the trust and respect that they have for him.\nAnd I think that he, in discussions with them, in private discussions with them, feels very optimistic about the shared goal that everybody has. Obviously, there's a lot of issues that have to get covered, but the President understands that they respect his ability to want to get this done -- his relationships and respect that have been developed.\nAnd I think this is something that he really wants to have happen.\nQ: And getting back to healthcare, why even monkey around with preexisting conditions? That's the most popular thing in Obamacare. Why are you guys spinning your wheels messing around with preexisting conditions?\nMR. SPICER: I wouldn't call it \"messing around,\" or however you phrased it. I think the President wants to do everything --\nQ: Right now, people with preexisting conditions are covered. They're not discriminated against.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, just hold on --\nQ: You're going to change to a system where who the hell knows what's going to happen. It depends on what state they live in. If they live in this state over here, that governor may seek a waiver and all of a sudden they're thrown into this system where hopefully that fund is going to cover their preexisting conditions. It is a big change for people who live with those kinds of illnesses, is it not?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, the big change -- I guess we have a very different view of this. Because my view, and I think the President's view, is that Obamacare -- if you have a preexisting condition and you no longer have a healthcare provider, or your premiums or deductible are going through the roof, then you don't have coverage.\nAnd we just read it out. I mean, I don't -- if you have --\nQ: So you're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, what I'm saying to you right now --\nQ: Repeal Obamacare because you're saying it's not working, but then why change preexisting conditions?\nMR. SPICER: We're not. No, no, we're strengthening -- I think -- look, we have done everything to not only strengthen but to guarantee --\nQ: Is it strengthening it if --\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely.\nQ: -- a governor can say, here's my waiver and no more preexisting conditions?\nMR. SPICER: Sure you can. Jim, I walked through this. But I think the fundamental point that seems to be getting lost is that if you have Obamacare right now, in case after case you are losing it. So if you have a preexisting condition and you have a card that says \"Obamacare\" but no one will see you or you can't afford it, then you don't have coverage.\nQ: Why not fix that?\nMR. SPICER: We are. We're guaranteeing it. But I don't know how much --\nQ: Why does the preexisting condition component have to be altered? Why not just keep that protection in place?\nMR. SPICER: The President has made it very clear that preexisting conditions are covered in the bill under every scenario. I don't know how much clearer we can state it.\nQ: So anybody who has a preexisting condition under Trumpcare, they're going to be fine, without question?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I want to follow up on healthcare. I just want to know why the White House is pushing so hard for a vote on this healthcare bill at a time when, as you just said a few minutes ago, it's literally impossible to analyze its impact on the healthcare system. Why not wait for that analysis to come out?\nMR. SPICER: The vote is going to happen, as I've said, like eight times now, when the Speaker and the Majority Leader and the Majority Whip want to. Our job is to work as hard as we can to work with members of Congress who want to see their healthcare system improved. That's what we're doing. That's what we've done. And so it will be up to the House leadership to decide when to vote.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions for you; one following on Jordan real quick. You just made a guarantee to the American people on behalf of the President regarding preexisting conditions, but you told Matt and then Jordan earlier that it's literally impossible to know the impact of this law. So how can you make that guarantee?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, he was asking -- they were asking about cost. The President has made it very clear on numerous occasions that he's going to make sure that preexisting conditions are covered.\nQ: And so then the White House has the analysis to back that up, is what you're saying?\nMR. SPICER: In every scenario, yes.\nQ: And then to just follow up on something that Director Mulvaney said yesterday regarding the President's tweet about calling for a \"good shutdown\" potentially in September. He said the reason the President sent that tweet was he was frustrated by Democrats spiking the football and thereby poisoning the well for future negotiations. The President, when he was campaigning, said he was going to win for all Americans. Why did the President's feelings matter at all?\nMR. SPICER: It's the process that I think he's frustrated with. Because he does want to win for every American, and I think that's why he's fought so hard for this. But you've seen time and time again Democrats obstruct routine things that they supposedly are for, but do everything they can to obstruct. I think the President is frustrated with the system. He's talked about how archaic it is in the Senate in particular. Because he's out there working to try to get, whether it's healthcare or tax reform or his Cabinet, through the Senate.\nThere are various things that the President is trying to do that are -- issues when he's having conversations with members of the Senate or the House who will say, I'm with you on this great idea but I just can't vote with you. He is, I think, understandably frustrated with how hard he's working to achieve the promises, goals and objectives that he set out with the American people to make the country better and to deal with multiple layers of obstructionism.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. So you've cited the 60-vote threshold as a reason why funding for the wall wasn't pursued in this spending bill, but what's going to be different in September? I mean, presumably the legislative conditions would be the same, so what will change between now and September to give you confidence that we'll get funding for the border wall then?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's multiple things. When you come in -- this CR, there was a lot that was already carried over from last time in terms of the -- because it's not just a continuing resolution, it's a total omnibus package, meaning that there are multiple bills that are a part of the underlying package that already have increases or underlying policy in them from the previous fiscal year, from the previous Congress, from the President administration.\nThis bill will reflect in 2018 the President's priorities in working with a Republican House and Senate. Thank you guys very much. We'll see you tomorrow in New York. Have a good one.\nEND 3:05 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-03", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123953", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Marjorie. To Dr. Alveda King; distinguished members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives; Senator Steve Daines, Congresswoman Diane Black -- an honoree tonight -- Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Trent Franks, so many other guests and friends, it is great to be back to the Susan B. Anthony List -- the most effective grassroots pro-life organization in America. (Applause.)\nJust delighted to be with you tonight. And I bring greetings from my friend, a great champion for life, and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThanks to the support of so many in this room and the Susan B. Anthony List, last November President Trump won a historic victory. More counties than any President since Ronald Reagan, 30 of 50 states -- states no Republican had carried in a generation. President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red. And SBA was there every step of the way. (Applause.) So really, I'm just here on behalf of the President to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped -- helped in this election and who are helping the President in the Oval Office who is fighting every day -- I promise you, fighting every single day -- to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law. (Applause.)\nIt is really is great to be back to the 10th annual Susan B. Anthony List Gala. This organization, 25 years in the making, 25 years strong, is named after the leading light of the women's rights movement in the 19th century -- a leader who fought tirelessly to empower her fellow women and to secure for them the rights that were, and are, and ever will be their birthright -- and so we remember and honor Susan B. Anthony tonight. (Applause.)\nToday the women leaders of the pro-life movement I believe are Susan B. Anthony's heirs -- like so many of the women here tonight, leaders in communities, leaders in business, leaders in public life. And there is someone who I believe actually best embodies the spirit and the courage of Susan B. Anthony in our own time. Would you join me in giving a standing ovation to Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is a champion, the best leader the pro-life movement has in the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAs I look out across this room, I see more friends than I can count. We've fought together. We've prayed together. We've believed together. And it's really hard for me to express, before my friends of so many years, the deep humility and gratitude that Karen and I feel to stand before you today -- my years in the Congress, my years as a governor -- as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. And I want to thank you -- thank you for the privilege to serve. (Applause.) Thank you for giving our family the opportunity to serve this country.\nYou know, I actually spoke at this very gala -- I think Marjorie mentioned it -- back in 2011. So much has changed since the last time I was here. Six years ago, I came here after the Susan B. Anthony List helped restore a pro-life majority in the House of Representatives. And now, thanks to you -- thanks to your tireless work, your support, and your prayers -- today we have a pro-life majority in the House of Representatives, a pro-life majority in the United States Senate, and we have a pro-life President of the United States. (Applause.) Thanks to SBA and the countless hours of volunteer time and resources provided for events like tonight, life is winning in America.\nEven before day one of this administration, President Donald Trump has also been keeping his promises to stand for life. The President knows that personnel is policy -- that's why he's literally filled this White House and federal agencies with pro-life leaders. (Applause.) Like I'm telling you anything here tonight. You've already heard from Kellyanne Conway, the Counselor to the President, who's with us here tonight. Would you stand up, Kellyanne? This is a great, great champion for life. (Applause.)\nAnd how about the President's world-class Cabinet full of great pro-life leaders. Marjorie mentioned a few -- Dr. Tom Price running Health and Human Services; Dr. Ben Carson at Housing and Urban Development; Rick Perry at the Department of Energy; and how about Ambassador Nikki Haley at the United Nations. Folks, this is the A-Team. (Applause.)\nAnd I know that everybody in this room was proud when just last week President Trump picked the former president of Americans United for Life to be Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services --Charmaine Yoest is on the team. (Applause.)\nFor the first time in a long time, America has an administration that's filled top to bottom with people who stand without apology for life. But it's not just the people. It's also the pro-life policies that President Trump is implementing across the board. In his first week in the Oval Office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, preventing taxpayer-funded foreign aid from paying for abortion or promoting abortion beyond America's borders. (Applause.)\nOnly a few days later, the President personally sent me to speak at the March for Life -- and I had the high honor of being the first sitting Vice President to ever speak at that annual gathering. (Applause.) And make no mistake about it, he was the one who sent me. Kellyanne was there, she knows. Karen and I were honored to represent him.\nI'll never forget, the Prime Minister of England was actually visiting that day. It was a busy day for the President, and he was unable to break away to make that traditional phone call that every Republican President has made since the days of Ronald Reagan to the March for Life. I was standing by his desk in the Oval Office -- remember, Kellyanne? Standing by his desk, and I said, fairly shyly, you know, they invited me, too. And he immediately said without hesitation, you go and tell them we're standing for the right to life. (Applause.) It's true.\nAnd of course, we all celebrate tonight the President's decision to nominate to the Supreme Court of the United States a new associate justice in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. I believe, and say from my heart with great confidence, that now Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch is a jurist who will keep faith with the Constitution and who will uphold the God-given liberties that are enshrined there. And last month, thanks in no small part to all of you, and to our honoree, Leonard Leo Judge Neil Gorsuch became Justice Neil Gorsuch, and he is on the Supreme Court today. (Applause.)\nMy friends, President Trump has been keeping his promises to all of you and the American people. I like to say that in this administration we're in the promise-keeping business. (Applause.) But I will tell you from my heart, it is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is so dedicated to caring for our most vulnerable in our society -- the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. (Applause.) My family and I are humbled to play even a small role in this historic time for our principles, the principles that we all hold dear.\nJust over one month ago, at President Trump's direction, I walked up the steps of the United States Capitol to do my duty as the President of the Senate. That day, the Senate had deadlocked on a crucial bill that was personally important to President Trump and to all who cherish life. On that day, at the President's direction, as President of the Senate, it was my privilege to cast the tie-breaking vote to give states the power to withhold taxpayer funding from abortion providers at the state level. (Applause.)\nYou know, the day the President signed that very bill into law did not mark the end of our fight to keep federal taxpayer money out of the hands of abortion providers. It was the beginning. And we're going to see that fight all the way through. (Applause.)\nThis President is unwavering -- he is unwavering in his commitment to defend life and protect women and children. And that commitment will be on full display this week -- if you haven't heard the news yet -- because tomorrow, thanks to President Trump's leadership, Congress is going to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.) And when they vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, we will finally defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.)\nWhen it comes to Obamacare, I don't have to remind anyone in this room that this is why Obamacare has got to go. Despite all the promises that were made, despite the tireless work of everyone in this room to stop it so many years ago, Obamacare has allowed taxpayer money to be used to purchase health insurance that covers abortion, among all of its other failings. We all remember all the promises of Obamacare, don't we? If you like your doctor you can keep him -- right? If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. Remember they promised you that health insurance premiums would go down. All the promises of Obamacare have been broken. And tomorrow, we begin the end of Obamacare once and for all. (Applause.)\nThe day Obamacare passed was also -- it was a day of disappointment for the sanctity of life. But hope is finally shining through. The bill before the Congress actually eliminates Obamacare's abortion expansion and it defunds Planned Parenthood, and keeps the President's promise to devote those resources to healthcare providers that help women without promoting abortion.\nWhen this bill passes, it, I believe, will be one of the defining victories for life. And know that the President is grateful for your continued support. We're just at the beginning, tomorrow. The House of Representatives is the first stage; then we head to the United States Senate. And I want to thank you in advance for all that each one of you will do in the future to help move this legislation forward -- to give voice to the voiceless, and bring healing and hope to women, to usher in a new era of healthcare in America that respects the values of the American people and finally and at last gives the American people the world-class healthcare that they deserve. (Applause.)\nMy friends, life is winning in America. And SBA is one of the big reasons why. Your support here tonight is making a difference for the cause of life in America. And I hope you know that. The President and I just came to say thanks. Life is winning through the steady advance of so many areas of science that illuminate almost on a daily basis when life begins. Life is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and homes to children in need. And life is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who minister to women in cities and towns across America.\nLife is winning, I believe, also through the quiet counsel between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables and coffee on college campuses -- I think the truth about abortion is being told. Compassion is overcoming convenience, and hope is defeating despair. Life is winning in America because of all of you -- because of your support and your prayers.\nI truly believe we've come to a pivotal moment in the life of this movement -- in the life of our nation. And in this moment, President Trump needs all of you to let your voices be heard -- to continue to stand up and speak out, as if it's the most important moment in the history of our movement -- because it is. We need every ounce of your energy and enthusiasm. We need your determination and conviction, your passion, and we need your prayers. We need you to continue to embody the spirit of Susan B. Anthony -- the namesake of this organization and our gala tonight, the great defender of women's rights.\nIn the rotunda of the United States Capitol stands a statue to that extraordinary American hero, and her sisters-in-arms, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It truly is a beautiful depiction, immortalizing their grace, their courage, their steely strength. But for all its beauty, those of you who have seen the statute know that it still remains unfinished -- the smooth and gleaming marble of those visionaries contrasting with the rough, unhewn block of stone behind them.\nI've often wondered what that unfinished statue represents, but now I think I know. The work that Susan B. Anthony and her companions began so long ago has not been completed. And so the statue remains unfinished. Yes the strides toward freedom that they boldly made will echo always -- securing suffrage rights for women being chief among them. But their accomplishments -- made all the more heroic by the criticism and condemnation they faced in their time -- have given shape to America as we know it today, and will inspire the people of this country forever.\nBut of all the wrongs that women faced that Susan B. Anthony and her fellow freedom fighters fought to right, too many still survive to this day -- and abortion is the worst of it. That's why we gather here. That's why, with President Trump, we march forward to complete their mission, complete their work.\nToday, tomorrow, and every day hence, let us strive with all our might to finish the work that Susan B. Anthony started, to ensure that the timeless promises of the Declaration of Independence -- of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- ring true and are preserved not only for ourselves, but our posterity. And this I know we will do.\nOn January 20th, when I took my Oath of Office, I only had two decisions to make. One was who would administer my Oath of Office, and I chose Justice Clarence Thomas. (Applause.) The second was what Bible I would use. And my son told me I had to use one of mine so the family would have it, and it was my great privilege to actually use the Bible, as well, that the 40th President of the United States used in January 1981 -- President Ronald Reagan's. (Applause.)\nI'll never forget -- the tradition is that you open the Bible to a particular verse. I did it when I was governor and I did it that day. I opened the Bible to the verse that I had chosen -- it was the same verse that I most often quoted on the campaign trail as I traveled around the country, campaigning on behalf of President Trump and with President Trump. And in the days as we labor ahead, as we advance this cause and continue to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law, these words that I chose I think are worth remembering today.\nIn fact, to my great delight, I found out that they were exactly the same verse that President Reagan took his oath of office on. When I learned that, that gave me a chill. It's these ancient words: That if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He'll do as He's always done -- He'll hear from heaven, He'll heal our land.\nThose words are as true today as they were in millennia past. And so I close tonight with faith -- faith that with your continued help, with God's help, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, we'll heal this land. We'll renew this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty -- and life -- for all.\nThank you very much. And may God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.

So yesterday I said that our spending bill was a win for the American people, which is exactly what it was: an amazing day. And this is what winning for young children and kids from all over the country looks like. The opportunity scholarship program that we're funding allows families in the inner city of our Nation's Capital to leave failing public schools and attend a private school, making an extraordinary difference in these incredible young lives. You're so lucky. Huh? [Laughter] Great. You're happy about it? Huh? So great. [Applause] That's great.\nThe results speak for themselves. Ninety-eight percent of scholarship recipients represent their high school diplomas, and they're really very, very special. They go onto tremendous successes. So I think you're going to all be very, very successful. You have a big start, right? Great start.\nThis is a beautiful event, and I'm thrilled to be here. I congratulate the families in the audience. Our families are very proud of the children. Are you all proud of children, I hope? Anybody not proud? We're very proud of you.\nDuring my campaign for President, I promised to fight for school choice—very important. It was featured in my Joint Address to Congress. And today I'm calling on all lawmakers to work with us to help extend school choice to millions more children all across the United States of America, including millions of low-income Hispanic and African American children who deserve the same chance as every other child in America to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.

He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123951", "text": "President Trump. Thank you very much. Today I am pleased to welcome President Abbas to the White House for his first visit to Washington in quite a while.\nAlmost 24 years ago, it was on these grounds that President Abbas stood with a courageous peacemaker, then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Here at the White House, President Abbas signed a Declaration of Principles—very important—which laid the foundation for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The President—and, Mr. President, you signed your name to the first Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. You remember that well, right?\nPresident Abbas. Right.\nThe President. And I want to support you in being the Palestinian leader who signs his name to the final and most important peace agreement that brings safety, stability, prosperity to both peoples and to the region.\nI'm committed to working with Israel and the Palestinians to reach an agreement. But any agreement cannot be imposed by the United States or by any other nation. The Palestinians and Israelis must work together to reach an agreement that allows both peoples to live, worship, and thrive and prosper in peace. And I will do whatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement, to mediate, to arbitrate anything they'd like to do. But I would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator. And we will get this done.\nPeace also means defeating ISIS and other terrorist groups. These groups are a threat to all people who cherish human life. I know President Abbas has spoken out against ISIS and other terrorist groups, and we must continue to build our partnership with the Palestinian security forces to counter and defeat terrorism.\nI also applaud the Palestinian Authority's continued security coordination with Israel. They get along unbelievably well. I had meetings, and at these meetings, I was actually very impressed and somewhat surprised at how well they get along. They work together beautifully. But there can be no lasting peace unless the Palestinian leaders speak in a unified voice against incitement to violate—and violence and hate. There's such hatred. But hopefully, there won't be such hatred for very long. All children of God must be taught to value and respect human life and condemn all of those who target the innocent.\nAs part of our efforts to move forward toward peace today, we will also discuss my administration's effort to help unlock the potential of the Palestinian people through new economic opportunities.\nLastly, I want to note the positive ongoing partnership between the United States and the Palestinians on a range of issues—private sector development and job creation, regional security, counterterrorism, and the rule of law—all of which are essential to moving forward toward peace.\nI welcome President Abbas here today as a demonstration of that partnership—that very special partnership—that we all need to make it all work. And I look forward to welcoming him back as a great mark of progress and, ultimately, toward the signing of a document with the Israelis and with Israel toward peace. We want to create peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We will get it done. We will be working so hard to get it done. It's been a long time, but we will be working diligently. And I think there's a very, very good chance, and I think you feel the same way.\nMr. President, thank you very much.\n[At this point, President Abbas spoke in Arabic, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Abbas. Mr. President, Your Excellency, I would like to thank you for this honorable invitation to come and meet with you, and I look much forward to working with you in order to come to that deal, to that historical agreement, historic deal to bring about peace.\nMr. President, our strategic option, our strategic choice is to bring about peace based on the vision of the two-state—a Palestinian state with its capital of East Jerusalem that lives in peace and stability with the state of Israel based on the borders of 1967.\nMr. President, for us to bring about a comprehensive and just peace based on the two-state solution, such matter would give a great impetus to the Arab Peace Initiative and the other initiatives, international initiatives, as well as it enables to fight and deter terrorism and fight the criminal ISIS group, ISIS—that is totally innocent and has nothing to do with our noble religion. And that also, if we create peace that is just and comprehensive, that will also lead the Arab and the Islamic countries to have normal relations with Israel based, as stipulated in the previous Arab summits, the latest of which was the Arab summit in Jordan.\nMr. President, we believe that we are capable and able to bring about success to our efforts because, Mr. President, you have the determination and you have the desire to see it become to fruition and to become successful. And we, Mr. President, inshallah, God willing, we are coming into a new opportunity, a new horizon that would enable us to bring about peace in that regard.\nMr. President, as far as the—a permanent solution, we believe that this is possible and able to be resolved. I am firmly believing that this is possibly—we are able to resolve it. And in that, I also believe that we will be able to resolve the issue of the refugees and the issue of the prisoners. According to the international law, according to the terms of international law, the international legitimacy, and the various relevant references and terms of reference in that regard, and based on what is stipulated in the previous treaties and agreements, that no unilateral steps must be taken to get ahead of the agreement and discussing those issues.\nMr. President, it's about time for Israel to end its occupation of our people and of our land after 50 years. We are the only remaining people in the world that still live under occupation. We are aspiring and want to achieve our freedom, our dignity, and our right to self-determination. And we also want for Israel to recognize the Palestinian state just as the Palestinian people recognize the State of Israel.\nMr. President, I affirm to you that we are raising our youth, our children, our grandchildren on a culture of peace. And we are endeavoring to bring about security, freedom, and peace for our children to live like the other children in the world, along with the Israeli children in peace, freedom, and security.\nMr. President, I bring with me today a—the message of the suffering of my people, as well as their aspirations and hope—the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people from the Holy Land, from that land where the three monotheist religions thrived—and the Jewish faith, the Christian faith, and the Muslim faith—where they all coexist together to foster it in an environment of security, peace, and stability, and love for all.\nMr. President, I believe that we are capable under your leadership and your stewardship to—your courageous stewardship and your wisdom, we are—and as well as your great negotiating ability, I believe, with the grace of God and with all of your effort—we believe that we can become—we can be partners, true partners, to you to bring about a historic peace treaty under your stewardship to bring about peace.\n[President Abbas spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Abbas. Now, Mr. President, with you we have hope.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much. So we're going to start a process. We've spoken to Bibi Netanyahu. We've spoken to many of the great Israeli leaders. We've spoken with many of your great representatives. Many of them are here today for lunch with us. We'll start a process which hopefully will lead to peace. Over the course of my lifetime, I've always heard that perhaps the toughest deal to make is the deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Let's see if we can prove them wrong. Okay?\nPresident Abbas. Okay.\nPresident Trump. Good. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123954", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:12 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon, everybody. Today, Sean is actually on Navy Reserve duty, so you guys are stuck with me -- today and tomorrow. So brace yourselves for a fun 24 hours. I know we have a vote happening here very soon that we are all closely watching, so we'll keep this quick today.\nEarlier today, the President signed an executive order promoting free speech and religious liberty. And this order does three important and primary things. It directs the IRS not to enforce the Johnson Amendment, which it could use to deny or revoke a church's nonprofit tax-exempt status. Repealing the Johnson Amendment was one of the President's key campaign promises.\nNumber two, it directs the Department of Health and Human Services to amend the Obamacare regulations that force people of faith to pay for birth control in direct conflict with their religious beliefs.\nAnd three, it directs all federal agencies and departments to protect religious liberty and free speech, consistent with guidance to be issued by the Department of Justice.\nDuring the last eight years, Americans of all faiths have been under attack from a federal government that has targeted individuals and institutions just for following their faith. The President was proud to take these important steps toward promoting two pillars of American society -- free speech and religious liberty.\nAlso today, most of you know, the President announced during his remarks at the National Day of Prayer that he will be making some additional stops ahead of his attending the G7 Summit in Italy, engaging with several important allies. The trip will kick off with a summit in Saudi Arabia with leaders from across the Muslim world. From there, he will travel to Israel and then to the Vatican in Rome. From Rome, he will continue on his previously announced visits to Brussels for the NATO Summit and meetings with EU and Belgian leaders, and to Sicily for the G7 meetings.\nAlso, as you know, I think the big topic today is the healthcare vote. We've got that coming up very shortly on the American Health Care Act. With Obamacare on the verge of collapse, it's critical that the House passes the AHCA today. And we continue to make progress towards repealing and replacing Obamacare.\nJust yesterday, Aetna announced it's pulling out of the individual market in Virginia, meaning 27 counties could only have one choice in 2018. Aetna's CEO himself said in February that Obamacare is in a \"death spiral.\" An incredible one-third of counties and five entire states only have one insurer left on the exchanges. Premiums and deductibles are spiking nationwide, and it's not surprising that fewer people signed up during the open enrollment period this year than last.\nWe hope to see our fellow Republicans follow through on the promise they've been making to the American people for the last seven years and on the floor of the House this afternoon -- and pass that vote.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. Go ahead.\nQ: Hi. Can you tell us anything more about why the President's schedule changed and what he will be doing during the healthcare vote specifically?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. The President still has some meetings this afternoon, and because of that we have pushed back his departure. In the process of that, we have spoken at the very highest level to members of the Australian embassy, as well as, I believe, the President -- spoke with the leader of Australia earlier today as well, great conversations. They're very much looking forward to meeting later this evening. They will continue to have the bilat as planned just a little bit later following the dinner later this evening.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I want to ask you about something Senator Graham said earlier today on Twitter. He wrote, \"A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and three hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.\" What's the White House response to that? And then I have a follow-up.\nMS. SANDERS: Of course you do. Look, I think the Senate is going to have their time to talk and debate this bill. Today it's about the House.\nLook, right now, Obamacare is collapsing under itself. It's simply not sustainable. I think everybody in the country, including Senator Graham, is well aware of that fact. We have to take drastic changes to reform the healthcare system. This is the first step in the process that the House is making today. And Senator Graham and his colleagues will have I think ample time to do that when it comes to the Senate.\nQ: And on that note, a number of House members have said they expect the bill, obviously, to change in the Senate and change for the better. Does the President agree with that sentiment? And can you give us some idea of the types of changes he would like to see in the Senate?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the biggest point on the healthcare bill is both the House, the Senate, and the administration believe in the principles of what we're looking to do -- lower cost, create competition, state flexibility. Those principles we don't want to change. If some of the way they get there in order to get senators on board, they tweak that a little bit, I think that's fully expected as it goes through the legislative process as long as the principles remain the same, that the President laid out throughout the campaign and that we're seeing reflected in the bill in the House today.\nGlenn.\nQ: Sarah, follow-up on that. You know, a lot of us sat through the debate over Obamacare and were around during the 2010 midterms when the Republican Party ran on this issue of fiscal responsibility, talked about the opacity of the Obama administration. And I remember when the final score on the reconciliation for the Affordable Care Act came out, that was a huge moment for Republicans, and they pointed out that they needed that as a tool to determine that this was a fiscally irresponsible bill. Isn't it hypocritical to not have a score before they vote on this? That's the first question.\nThe second one is, what's the big rush? Can't you guys wait a week and actually get a score on this?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think even if they were to score it it's impossible to score a lot of the things that would go into this because it has so many different factors that you simply can't predict what governors may do in their states, specific conditions that patients may have.\nSo even if it was to be scored, I think it would be impossible to predict how that might actually affect and impact.\nQ: Sarah, can you elaborate a little bit on that third piece of the EO? I think it was actually the first -- last night it was the first -- the policy statement directing all agencies to observe religious freedom? What kinds of rules are you looking at there?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's less about rules and more about the Department of Justice would be the one that would have to defend anything that any agency would do. And so in order to produce guidance that would run through the Department of Justice, I think it's simply just pointed out that process.\nQ: Is this going to affect, for example, employment or the baker that doesn't want to cater the gay wedding?\nMS. SANDERS: This executive order doesn't address any employment specifically. There's no language in that here.\nSorry, go ahead.\nQ: How would you describe Jared and Ivanka's role in the formation of this EO?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any specific role they may have played. I think that they are supportive of the President's decision on this. I don't think it's any secret this is something he's campaigned on for a long time and they joined him on the campaign trail every day. And so I think that they would be supportive in this process.\nQ: Did they argue for the softening of any of the language in it?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: I've got two quick questions. We know President Obama happily embraced the term \"Obamacare.\" Is Trump going to embrace \"Trumpcare\" for this legislation?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President is embracing reform. I think that's what he's done since day one. I don't think it's about a label or a name, it's about providing better care for Americans across the country. That's been his focus. It's not about taking credit for something, but it's about fixing a broken system. That's what he's doing. That's what his focus is. And that's why you're not seeing him run out and try to put a label on it today.\nQ: So it sounds like he doesn't want to call it Trumpcare. And then a preexisting conditions --\nMS. SANDERS: Shocking, a reporter took something out of context.\nQ: He does want to call it Trumpcare then?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, again, the point here isn't about the label, it's about getting better care. If you want to get into the semantics of that, that's fine, but that's certainly not what I said.\nQ: All right. About better care, the preexisting conditions mandate under Obamacare ensured coverage, but it also protected against raising rates for people with preexisting conditions. So can you guarantee in this legislation that people with preexisting conditions will not be paying more for those conditions, for their healthcare?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that nobody will be charged higher premiums for keeping their coverage. Look, the goal is to lower costs across the board through competition, through market forces. We'll lower those premiums and make healthcare easier for everybody. We've also put I believe the Upton Amendment as well as other things, extra layers of protection for those with preexisting conditions.\nQ: Can you walk us through the steps the President has taken to help sell this latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare? I remember the last time, Sean talked about the number of calls and meetings. And also, can you talk about what specific case he's making to lawmakers beyond listening to their concerns? Is he making a case on the policy front or on the sort of general, this-is-what-we-need-to-win front?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly. The President has been incredibly engaged in this process, particularly over the last several days. He's made well over a dozen, probably close to 15 to 20 direct contacts, whether through meetings or phone calls -- actually that's 15 to 20 members. Some of those people he's talked to more than one time.\nAgain, the President recognizes what a problem Obamacare is, and that it has to be fixed. He's made it a priority to help get that through the House this week, as well as the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, and other members of the team. And he's been very directly engaged.\nI think part of the case that he's made outside of simply \"let's get this done\" is that it's a necessity. Obamacare is simply unsustainable. I think even Democrats have started to recognize that we can't continue on the path that we're on and this is our moment and our time to fix it, so let's do it, let's do it right, and let's do it now. And that's what he's been doing this week.\nQ: Just one more question about what a senior administration official told us in the last briefing ahead of the foreign trip. They said, \"This trip will reverse the trend of America's disengagement from the world.\" Can you expand on that and talk about how America has disengaged from the world? Because it seems like part of the President's argument during the campaign at least was that America doesn't have to be the policeman of the world, sort of arguing against, I guess, more engagement.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that the President's point and certainly his kind of priority and leading philosophy has always been an American first. And that's not different. And I think that those things are compatible.\nAmerica can be first but still be a global leader. And I think, frankly, America has to be a global leader. The rest of the country [sic] looks to us for that. We're at a time -- when the President took office where a lot of our allies simply didn't respect us or trust us, and our enemies didn't fear us. And we're back to a place where we're developing our relationships with our allies, we're strengthening those, and we're also putting everybody else on notice that we have a President that's strong and that is not going to allow things like North Korea to continue to grow and continue to move out of control.\nJordan.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. The ACLU and a bunch of other groups are -- already announced their plan to sue the administration over this executive order, saying it violates the establishment clause of the Constitution. What's your response to that? And do you have a legal strategy to fight back these lawsuits?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I don't think anybody is surprised that the ACLU -- they love to come out against Republicans. They love to talk about debating tolerance except when it comes to people of faith. And I think that this is actually -- they should be celebrating that people are being protected. That's what this executive order is about. It's not about discriminating, it's not about being against anyone, but it's simply about protecting people of faith, and that's people of all faith across the country. That's something that the President heard from religious leaders of all diversities during his time on the campaign. It's something that he promised to do. And that's something he's fulfilled on.\nAnd I think that the Constitution is on our side here. The very basis of it is freedom of speech, and that shouldn't be taken away simply because of a faith that you may hold.\nQ: Sorry, can I ask a follow-up?\nQ: Go ahead.\nQ: Did the Counsel's Office prepare for these lawsuits, and how were they involved in the drafting of the EO?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the counsel's office, I know, is prepared and certainly recognizes the role that they might play in this, and has very firm ground on which they stand here.\nTrey.\nQ: Sarah, just following up on Athena's question a bit, can you talk about the legwork the President has done today in these final moments before the vote? What has he been doing this morning? We know that he spoke yesterday. Congressman Billy Long came out here and told us that he had received multiple phone calls from the President. What has he done this morning leading up to this vote?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think he's continued to have conversations with different members of the House and looking for ways to push this forward. And we feel very confident. I think a lot of that took place yesterday. One of the big pieces, as you mentioned, was meeting with Representatives Long and Upton. That was a huge and pivotal moment, and, I think, a direct result of the President being engaged in pushing the bill forward.\nQ: A question on the foreign policy trip: Can you talk about the President's decision to head first to Saudi Arabia? How directly he was involved in this? We did receive some background information on this, but talk about the President's involvement in planning this part of the trip.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think he recognizes the importance of bringing all of our partners together, and certainly looking for ways that we can combat some of the greatest threats to all of the world. And that's going to take some buy-in and some of the people in the Middle East taking a larger stake in that process. And I think that's a big part of what we're going to see on that trip.\nQ: Sarah, following up on what Glenn asked earlier -- but following up on what Glenn asked, why not score this in a week and eliminate the argument against it by saying it wasn't scored? Why not?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, again, I think I addressed that when I answered Glenn's question. I think even if we went through the process of trying to score this legislation, it's going to be inaccurate. It's going to be hard to do because there's so many factors -- whether it's decisions that governors would make and individual -- one of the big pieces that makes this popular is the flexibility that it provides -- something we didn't see with Obamacare. That's going to be hard to score, and I think that's one of the reasons that we should continue to move forward.\nQ: The other one is on the separation of church and state. There are people saying that what you've set up with this particular -- well, it's a follow-up on a different one.\nMS. SANDERS: It's totally separate.\nQ: Some totally separate issue.\nMS. SANDERS: We'll let it slide.\nQ: Well, to follow up on him, wouldn't it just take the air out of the balloon of the Democrats if you said, hey, look, it's scored, now you can argue with it?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the air is out of the Democrats already. They want Obamacare, and that's simply not a sustainable piece of legislation. I think their balloon deflated a long time ago.\nQ: Okay, so on the follow-up on the other. Just the signed executive order -- what about those who say, look, it's eroding the separation between church and state and that's why it's a bad thing?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think it's very hard to argue that a pastor or another faith leader shouldn't be able to speak out about morality in the public square. I think that it would be almost like Martin Luther King, Jr. shouldn't have been allowed to speak out against George Wallace. I don't think anybody in this room would argue that that would be an appropriate thing to do, and that is what the Johnson Amendment currently does. And we see this as a hurdle to freedom of speech, and certainly something that should be protected.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You mentioned that the meeting now with Mr. Turnbull will be, did you say after the dinner?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe it will be before. I know we're going to issue updated guidance here shortly, but I believe it will be about 7:15 will be the new time for the bilat.\nQ: So I have a question about that. So the fact that it's being pushed back, the departure time, what should we take from that? If you guys have the votes for healthcare, why is the President pushing back his departure?\nMS. SANDERS: I didn't say that the President was doing -- I said he had meetings and that doesn't mean they pertain to healthcare in any capacity. He's got some other things he wants to take care of before he leaves town, and so it's nothing more than that.\nQ: And finally, could you possibly give us a little preview of what we should expect tonight with this meeting? What's the significance of having it on the Intrepid? What does he hope to get out of it? We haven't heard very much about that.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I don't want to get ahead of their visit, but I think that you can expect a strengthening out of an already-strong ally, and furthered continued great relationship that we have with them.\nQ: When the President was speaking to President Putin (inaudible) did he mention his plans for the Middle East and the trip that you described today? And is there a chance that they might meet during that trip to Europe?\nMS. SANDERS: I know we put out a readout on that call, and at this point I don't have anything further to add. I know that the topic did come up -- whether or not they may meet later this year -- but nothing was finalized on that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I have two brief questions.\nMS. SANDERS: I can always count to hear you from the back. (Laughter.)\nQ: Regarding the President's upcoming visit with the Pope, is he going to meet with, or has he met already with, say, American cardinals or other church leaders to kind of sketch out what the agenda will be for the papal visit?\nMS. SANDERS: I know he met, actually, a number of church cardinals earlier today. There was a small private meeting with that group and with other -- I think roughly over 100 other religious leaders today as well as last night. So I think certainly he'll continue those conversations in preparation for that trip.\nQ: Two weeks ago, Senator Grassley predicted there would be another vacancy on the Supreme Court by the summer, and that the President would choose from his list of 25 that he released during the campaign and from which he chose Justice Gorsuch. If there is a vacancy and Senator Grassley is correct, will the President limit his choices just to that list that he released or will he bring other names into the equation?\nMS. SANDERS: My understanding is that he would stay focused and draw from that list. So I don't see any reason for him to go a different direction.\nQ: Insurers are filing their rates for 2018 coverage right now. They're already in Virginia. And so, to the extent that there is turbulence in the market, and the House needs to vote on AHCA today, how long is the President willing to give the Senate to decide what to do with it?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think a specific timetable has been discussed, but I do know that it's certainly a priority for the administration to get this done. So I would hope that the Senate will take action quickly.\nQ: Weeks? Months?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we haven't laid a timetable out, and I don't think we will. But I know that we hope to have this done in short order.\nQ: Is he worried about any uncertainty in the meantime?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't believe so, no.\nQ: Sarah, if the vote passes, can we expect -- there are reports out of Capitol Hill that some members are prepared to come to the White House for some sort of celebratory event. Can you tell us anything about that, and can we expect to hear from the President directly here before he departs?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have any announcements right now, but if something happens, as always, we'll certainly keep you guys posted.\nI'll take one more question. Go ahead.\nQ: Sarah, Syria, please?\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry. Sure, I'll take both for you guys. Sorry.\nQ: I was just going to ask if what -- the Senate, if, assuming it will pass later today, goes over to the Senate, that the President will be as involved in getting it passed in the Senate as he's been getting it passed in the House?\nMS. SANDERS: I would certainly think so.\nLast question.\nQ: The Vice President said this week that President Trump is seriously considering moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. What's the thinking right now on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we don't want to get ahead of any of the conversations that we're going to continue to have with leaders. I think the President will be the one to speak to that, certainly not me, not here, and not today. But we'll leave that to the President to further comment on that as we get closer and possibly on our trip while we're there.\nThanks, guys.\nEND 1:24 P.M.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124191", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, Buenas tardes a todos -- and feliz casi Cinco de Mayo. (Applause.) Today, it's my great honor, on behalf of the First Family, to welcome you to the White House on this eve of Cinco de Mayo. (Applause.) And I bring greetings from the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nAnd we are so proud of this Cabinet, and I am so grateful -- Secretary Alex Acosta, thank you for that kind introduction. Would you all join me in giving a vigorous round of applause to the new Secretary of Labor for the United States of America? (Applause.) And, Jovita Carranza, thank you for being here, and congratulations on your nomination to become the next Treasurer of the United States of America. (Applause.) And, Ambassador Gutiйrrez, who changed his travel plans to be here with us today, it is a privilege to have you here. We are honored by your presence. Thank you for all that you do to build a stronger relationship between the United States and Mexico. We are truly grateful. (Applause.)\nAnd thanks to all the Hispanic leaders from the life of business, from the life of faith, from public life who are here with us today, especially let me thank Mario Rodriguez and the members of the President's National Hispanic Advisory Council, and our sponsor, the Hispanic 100 for putting on this great, great celebration on the eve of Cinco de Mayo. (Applause.)\nIt really is an honor to me to be with you today. The President personally asked me to join you today as we celebrate this important moment in the life of this nation and in the history of so many Americans. But let me also say it's a particular joy to be here tonight with my much, much, much better half -- my wife of 31 years, Karen Pence. Would you join me in welcoming her tonight? (Applause.)\nThe President asked me to be here today to help all of you commemorate a day defined by courage and sacrifice in the defense of freedom. One-hundred and fifty-five years ago tomorrow, in the Battle of Puebla, the Mexican Army won a historic victory of freedom against the invading French. Despite being outnumbered two to one, the bravery and valor of the Mexican people that day won has been an inspiration ever since, and their heroism has won the hearts of the people not only in Mexico, but across America.\nCinco de Mayo has become a day to celebrate the extraordinary contributions that Mexican Americans -- and, really, all Hispanic Americans -- have made and continue to make in the United States of America. Today, millions of Americans can trace their heritage back to Mexico, from past generations we celebrate their many contributions to the life of this nation. From the arts to the armed forces, from the sciences to sports, Mexican Americans have made a lasting impact on our nation -- and on our history books, and filled those history books with names of trailblazers.\nI think of Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic woman who ascended the stars as an astronaut. I think of Richard Cavazos, the first Hispanic four-star general in the United States Army. I think of Octaviano Larrazolo, the first Hispanic to serve in the United States Senate in the 1920s. And, of course, I think of my friend, Governor Susanna Martinez, the first Hispanic woman to serve as governor in the governor of New Mexico. (Applause.)\nI really think today -- the President and I both do -- of all Hispanic Americans and Mexican Americans who, every day for generations, have contributed to this nation, who have raised families, who have built communities, started businesses, added their voices and talents to making America great. Economically, culturally, in our churches, our towns and cities across this country, the truth is that Mexican Americans and Hispanic Americans as a whole make a difference in America every single day. And that really is what we celebrate in Cinco de Mayo.\nWe think of the extraordinary number of Hispanic-owned businesses, which actually grew by more than 50 percent over the past decade, and nearly half of all the Latino-owned firms are owned by people of Mexican heritage. And Latina-owned small businesses are the fastest-growing business sector in the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAnd for more than 150 years, Hispanic Americans have served with distinction in every branch of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. And we honor their service now. (Applause.)\nThe Regiment in the Civil War, from the Arizona National Guard's 158th Infantry Regiment in World War II -- which General Douglas MacArthur called \"one of the greatest fighting combat teams ever deployed for battle\" -- Hispanics have a long and proud history of putting on the uniform to defend our freedom and our very way of life. And over 250,000 Latinos are serving in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, and our Reserves at this very moment.\nFolks, the Mexican American -- and all Hispanic American -- communities are one of the most vibrant threads in our national fabric. Their success -- your success is America's success. And that's why President Donald Trump is fighting every day to empower Hispanic Americans to contribute even more to our country's future.\nThe President has made the Latino community a priority and we always will. We've been participating already with the Latino Coalition, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in conferences and listening sessions, with business owners, parents, teachers, healthcare workers. The President has made a point as we've had listening sessions one after another at the White House, to ensure that we're hearing from the Hispanic community in America as well.\nSince day one, the President has taken decisive action to restore opportunity and prosperity for every American -- including Hispanics -- to make it possible for every American to climb the ladder of success and live the American Dream.\nIn fact, you saw the President's leadership on full display this last week. Thanks to President Donald Trump, what you saw pass in the House of Representatives today is the beginning of the end of Obamacare. (Applause.) Just a few short hours ago, with strong support in the U.S. House of Representatives, we took an important step to repeal and replace Obamacare, and replace it finally with the kind of healthcare reform that every American deserves.\nBut it's not just health care. President Trump's agenda also includes taxes, and regulation, and energy. The President is absolutely determined to ensure that, as we go forward in this country, we promote policies that will create jobs and opportunity for every American, including Hispanic Americans. In fact, the President is preparing right now, after we move forward in the Congress with healthcare reform, this President is going to pass the largest tax cut in American history. (Applause.)\nAll these issues we know are very important to the Latino community, as they are to every American. Just yesterday, the President also hosted a group of students from here in Washington, D.C., including many Hispanic children, to celebrate another important step -- a step for educational opportunity. The President this week, in the spending bill -- a bill he'll sign tomorrow -- was able to extend the educational voucher program here in our nation's capital, opening doors of opportunity to disadvantaged children. (Applause.)\nThe D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program really is a case study in school choice success. When the President signs the renewal into law in the spending bill this week, it will be a victory for families in Washington, D.C.\nPresident Trump is really fighting every day, and will keep fighting every day, with Secretary Betsy DeVos at the helm, to make sure every in America has access to a world-class education of their choice. (Applause.)\nSo as I close, on this eve of Cinco de Mayo, let me just say that, like all of you, I count among the greatest blessings of my life, to simply call myself an American. And we're all descended from those who didn't have that blessing, and strived with all of their might to obtain it. We are, as the saying goes, with a few exceptions, a nation of immigrants, and that's as true today as it was at the hour of America's birth.\nIn his Joint Address to Congress, President Trump promised to, in his words, \"serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States,\" to \"strengthen our nation's security,\" to \"restore respect for our laws.\" Our President believes that a system based on the rule of law will benefit every American, including Hispanic Americans through renewed safety and prosperity. And as President Trump said to Congress, \"real and positive immigration reform is possible.\" (Applause.)\nAnd on this eve of Cinco de Mayo, I can assure everyone here that as we move forward, we will, as the President said, in his words, \"show great heart\" every step of the way.\nThis is a deeply personal matter for those of you in this room, and it's also a deeply personal matter for me. You know, it was nearly a century ago that my great-grandmother, as the story goes in our family, handed my grandfather, as a young man, a one-way ticket from Ireland to America. The legend in our family is that my grandmother walked him up the hill outside that little house in Tubbercurry, Ireland. She looked across to the west of Ox Mountains, and thought of the Atlantic before them.\nAnd she said, \"you have to go to America\" because, in his words, \"there's a future there for you.\" You know, Richard Michael Cawley -- which happens to be where Michael Richard Pence got his name -- stepped ashore on Ellis Island as a young man on April 11, 1923. He made his way to Chicago, where he drove a bus for 40 years. He put roots down. He built a good name, a wonderful family. He raised a precocious redhead whose blue eyes and red hair still flame to this day. She married a fast-talking salesman who took her down to southern Indiana, where I showed up.\nMy grandfather's story, my mom's story, and my story is like the stories of so many of you here, and the families that celebrate Cinco de Mayo this week. It's really the story of the American Dream. My grandfather was an Irishman by birth, but he became an American by choice, and was proud of it. And when he went home to be with the Lord, in 1980, he left behind a family and a grandson who will forever be grateful for his courage and his willingness to come.\nIt was Inauguration Day -- just seems like a few short months ago. And I thought a lot about my grandfather. I was thinking, as I prepared to take that oath of office as the 48th Vice President of the United States, what my grandfather must have thought. And I was sure of just two things. Number one, he knew me well, so I'm sure he was very surprised. (Laughter.) And secondly, I just know, looking down from glory, that immigrant grandfather of mine knew that he was right. He was right about America. That is, this is a land of opportunity freedom, where anybody can anybody.\nYou know, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who, each and every day, is working his heart out to renew the American Dream and the opportunity to live that dream for everyone in this country. And today I say with confidence that the future is bright -- brighter than ever before -- for Hispanic Americans and Americans of every background. And with Donald Trump in the White House, and with your help and God's help, I know the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come.\nSo thank you for coming today, and happy Cinco de Mayo.

It will happen.\"\n- President Donald J. Trump\nOBAMACARE IS COLLAPSING: Across the country, Obamacare is failing the American people, delivering high costs, few options, and broken promises.\n* Despite false promises of lowering healthcare costs for all Americans, under Obamacare, real healthcare has become unaffordable as premiums and deductibles have spiraled out of control.\n* Under Obamacare, premiums have risen by over 40 percent on average, and over 100 percent in some places.\n* The Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 8.4 million Americans would see a sharp rise in premiums this year.\n* Six states on the Federal Obamacare exchange saw premiums rise by over 50 percent.\n* The two most popular Obamacare health plans had deductibles equivalent to 10 percent and 6 percent of the American household's median income.\n* In 2016 alone, average individual premiums went up by 25 percent. Average deductibles increased in 41 states, with 17 of them facing double digit rate increases.\n* Americans across the country have seen their health insurance choices collapse under Obamacare, leaving an increasing number with only one option.\n* In 2017, five states have only one insurer on the Obamacare marketplace and nearly a third of all counties have only one insurer.\n* According to the McKinsey Center, the number of eligible Americans with only one insurer to choose from increased from 2 percent in 2016 to 18 percent in 2017.\n* The number of insurers on the Obamacare marketplace fell by 28 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n* With high costs and few options, it is no surprise that Americans are fleeing Obamacare.\n* Enrollment fell by 500,000 people in 2017 compared to 2016, and enrollment is millions of people below what was initially estimated.\n* In 2016, nearly 20 million people opted out of Obamacare all together, with 6.5 million forced to pay the mandate penalty.\n* Obamacare was sold to the American people with rosy promises that have been routinely broken.\n* Americans were promised Obamacare would bring down healthcare costs, but instead Americans continue their premiums skyrocket.\n* President Obama was forced to apologize to Americans for promising that \"if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\"\n* President Obama's false promise was named 2013's \"lie of the year.\"\n* Americans were promised Obamacare would increase competition among insurance companies, but more and more are leaving the marketplace.\n* President Obama promised the middle class wouldn't see their taxes raised \"by a single dime,\" but the Joint Committee on Taxation found a $377 billion tax hike.\nREPEALING AND REPLACING: President Donald J. Trump supports the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which will remove Obamacare's burden and put in place a responsible replacement.\n* The AHCA protects the most vulnerable Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.\n* Nobody can be denied coverage on the basis of a pre-existing condition and the bill provides over $120 billion for states to keep those plans affordable.\n* $8 billion is specifically directed to states that waive certain Obamacare rules to ensure plans stay affordable for those with pre-existing conditions.\n* Insurance companies are banned from increasing premiums or turning away patients from renewing their plans simply because they are sick\n* $79 billion is being restored to hospitals who provide a high proportion of care to the most vulnerable, including those on Medicaid and Medicare.\n* $100 billion is being provided to states to help low-income Americans access affordable health care.\n* $15 billion is being provided for the care of maternity, newborn, mental health, and substance abuse.\n* $8 billion is being provided to Americans who see changes in premiums due to their state's decision to seek a waiver for some community ratings.\n* Medicaid financing is reformed to send money to states based on its population, prioritizing funding for the most vulnerable and economic downturns.\n* States will have the option of both a block grant and work requirements for certain populations.\n* The AHCA reduces costs of health care to Americans, while providing greater choice and flexibility.\n* Middle and low income Americans will receive monthly, advanceable, and refundable tax credits to help pay for healthcare premiums.\n* Tax credits will range from $2,000 to $14,000 a year and will adjust to make sure older Americans receive proper support.\n* Americans will have expanded access to health savings accounts (HSAs) by nearly doubling the maximum allowed tax-deductible contribution.\n* In 2017, an individual American would be able to deduct $6,550 in contributions to an HAS.\n* One-size-fits-all mandates will be eliminated to free States to create marketplaces that promote innovation and competition.\n* Job-based health insurance is preserved and relief is provided from the current law's \"Cadillac tax.\"\n* AHCA will reduce Federal spending while lowering taxes for Americans.\n* The Federal deficit will be reduced as major entitlement reform capping Medicaid spending will save taxpayers nearly $840 billion.\n* Americans, including middle-income and small business owners, will see nearly $1 trillion in tax relief.\nA PROMISE TO AMERICA: President Trump Has repeatedly said he will repeal the collapsing Obamacare with real healthcare reform that will benefit all Americans.\n* March 24, 2017, President Trump: \"I want to have a great healthcare bill and plan – and we will. It will happen.\"\n* March 24, 2017, President Trump: Obamacare is \"exploding right now\" and \"almost all states have big problems.\"\n* October 9, 2017, Mr. Trump: \"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely less expensive. And something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.\"\n* October 9, 2017, Mr. Trump: \"Obamacare is a disaster. You know it, we all know it.\"", "timestamp": "2017-05-04", "title": "Press Release - House Advances American Health Care Act"}

Thank you.\nThank you very much. This really is the group. What a great group of people. And they're not even doing it for the party, they're doing it for this country, because we suffered with Obamacare. I went through 2 years of campaigning, and I'm telling you, no matter where I went, people were suffering so badly with the ravages of Obamacare.\nAnd I will say this, that as far as I'm concerned, your premiums, they're going to start to come down. We're going to get this passed through the Senate. I feel so confident. Your deductibles, when it comes to deductibles, they were so ridiculous that nobody got to use their current plan, this nonexistent plan that I heard so many wonderful things about over the last 3 or 4 days. After that, I mean, it's—I don't think you're going to hear so much. Right now, the insurance companies are fleeing. It's been a catastrophe. And this is a great plan. I actually think it will get even better. And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and a replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it. [Applause] Make no mistake.\nAnd I think, most importantly, yes, premiums will be coming down. Yes, deductibles will be coming down. But very importantly, it's a great plan. And ultimately, that's what it's all about.\nWe knew that wasn't going to work. I predicted it a long time ago. I said, it's failing. And now, it's obvious that it's failing. It's dead. It's essentially dead. If we don't pay lots of ransom money over to the insurance companies, it would die immediately.\nSo what we have is something very, very incredibly well crafted. Tell you what, there is a lot of talent standing behind me. An unbelievable amount of talent, that I can tell you. I mean it. And coming from a different world and only being a politician for a short period of time—how am I doing? Am I doing okay? I'm President. Hey, I'm President. Can you believe it? Right? I don't know, it's—I thought you needed a little bit more time. They always told me, more time. But we didn't.\nBut we have an amazing group of people standing behind me. They worked so hard, and they worked so long. And when I said, let's do this, let's go out, just short little shots for each one of us, and let's say how good this plan is. We don't have to talk about this unbelievable victory—wasn't it unbelievable? So we don't have to say it again. But it's going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate.\nAnd there's so much spirit there. But I said, let's go out—we have a little list of some of the people—and I think after that list goes, if they don't talk too long, our first list, we're going to let some of the other folks just come up and say whatever you want.\nBut we want to brag about the plan, because this plan really—uh oh. [Laughter] Well, we may. [Laughter] But we're just going to talk a little bit about the plan, how good it is, some of the great features.\nI want to thank Paul Ryan. He has worked so hard. I was joking, I said, you know, Paul, for the last week, I've been hearing: \"Paul Ryan doesn't have it. It's not working with Paul Ryan. He's going to get rid of Paul Ryan.\" And then, today I heard: \"Paul Ryan is a genius. He's come a long way.\" [Laughter] Right?\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Paul D. Ryan. I'll take whatever.\nThe President. The groups have all come together. We have the Tuesday Group—we have so many groups. We have the Freedom Caucus. We have—and they're all great people. But we have a lot of groups. But they all came together. Really, Paul, I'd say in the last 3, 4 days, especially in the last day. I see Mark, and I see Kevin; I see so many people—Jim.\nWe just have developed a bond. This has really brought the Republican Party together, as much as we've come up with a really incredible health care plan. This has brought the Republican Party together. We're going to get this finished, and then we're going—as you know we put our tax plan in, it's a massive tax cut, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. I used to say the biggest since Ronald Reagan. Now, it's bigger than that. Also, pure tax reform. So we're going to get that done next.\nAnd this really helps it. A lot of people said, how come you kept pushing health care, knowing how tough it is? Don't forget, Obamacare took 17 months. Hillary Clinton tried so hard—really valiantly, in all fairness—to get health care through. Didn't happen. We've really been doing this for 8 weeks, if you think about it. And this is a real plan. This is a great plan. And we had no support from the other party.\nSo I just want to introduce somebody to say a few words who really has been, I think, treated very unfairly, but it no longer matters, because we won, and we're going to finish it off. And we're going to go on to a lot of other things, and we are going to have a tremendous 4 years and maybe, even more importantly, we're going to have a tremendous 8 years. But we're going to start off with just a great first year.\nAnd, Paul Ryan, come up and say a few words. Congratulations on a job well done.", "timestamp": "2017-05-04", "title": "Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of Health Care Reform Legislation"}

We are united in prayer, each according to our own faith and tradition, and we believe that in America, people of all faiths, creeds, and religions must be free to exercise their natural right to worship according to their consciences.\nWe are also reminded and reaffirm that all human beings have the right, not only to pray and worship according to their consciences, but to practice their faith in their homes, schools, charities, and businesses—in private and in the public square—free from government coercion, discrimination, or persecution. Religion is not merely an intellectual exercise, but also a practical one that demands action in the world. Even the many prisoners around the world who are persecuted for their faith can pray privately in their cells. But our Constitution demands more: the freedom to practice one's faith publicly.\nThe religious liberty guaranteed by the Constitution is not a favor from the government, but a natural right bestowed by God. Our Constitution and our laws that protect religious freedom merely recognize the right that all people have by virtue of their humanity. As Thomas Jefferson wisely questioned: \"can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God?\"\nIn 1789, President George Washington proclaimed a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, calling upon Americans to \"unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations.\" In 1988, the Congress, by Public Law 100-307, called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a \"National Day of Prayer.\" On this National Day of Prayer, the right to pray freely and live according to one's faith is under threat around the world from coercive governments and terrorist organizations. We therefore pray especially for the many people around the world who are persecuted for their beliefs and deprived of their fundamental liberty to live according to their conscience. We pray for the triumph of freedom over oppression, and for God's love and mercy over evil.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 4, 2017, as a National Day of Prayer. I invite the citizens of our Nation to pray, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, in thanksgiving for the freedoms and blessings we have received, and for God's guidance and continued protection as we meet the challenges before us.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom. The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views were integral to a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the Federal Government. For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines and protects the fundamental right to religious liberty as Americans' first freedom. Federal law protects the freedom of Americans and their organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life without undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch will honor and enforce those protections.\nSec. 2. Respecting Religious and Political Speech. All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and organizations to engage in religious and political speech. In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury. As used in this section, the term \"adverse action\" means the imposition of any tax or tax penalty; the delay or denial of tax-exempt status; the disallowance of tax deductions for contributions made to entities exempted from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of title 26, United States Code; or any other action that makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit.\nSec. 3. Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate promulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.\nSec. 4. Religious Liberty Guidance. In order to guide all agencies in complying with relevant Federal law, the Attorney General shall, as appropriate, issue guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in Federal law.\nSec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

But I love Australia, always have. In fact, Greg Norman is here today, a friend of ours. And we have a lot of friends here tonight.\nPrime Minister Turnbull.

We had a very, very good call. That was a little bit of fake news, as the expression goes.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. That's exactly right.\nQ.

How important is the event tonight?\nPresident Trump. Right. I will be speaking about the Battle of the Coral Sea tonight. That was some battle. That was a very important battle for both of us.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. It was.\nPresident Trump. We did it together.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. We did. It was the—it saved Australia, and it was the turning point in the war. And I was just up on the flight deck with some of the veterans, American and Australian veterans. They were teenagers when they turned the war, the tide of war——\nPresident Trump. That's right. Turned it around.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. ——and Australia and America started to win.\nPresident Trump. So we have been allies for 99 years. Can you imagine that? Ninety-nine years and never a bad time. So it's a great, great thing.\nHealth Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Mr. President, how hard is it going to be to get that health care deal through the Senate?\nPresident Trump. I think we will get it through. The Republicans are very united like seldom before. I mean, you've seen that today. The Republicans came together all of a sudden 2 days ago, and it was like magic. They just came together. They're very, very united. Every group from Freedom Caucus to Tuesday to every single group. A lot of groups. A lot of great people. But they are very, very united. You saw that today, and you'll see it again. The Senate is looking forward to getting it. Mitch McConnell knows how to do things. And I think we are going to have some really great health care for a long time.\nHealth Care Reform Legislation/Australia's Health Care System/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nQ. President Trump, what do you say to some of the congressmen who are concerned about how it will change in the Senate?\nPresident Trump. Well, it could change a little bit. It could get maybe even better. It is a very good bill right now. The premiums are going to come down very substantially. The deductibles are going to come down. It is going to be fantastic health care.\nRight now Obamacare is failing. We have a failing health care. I shouldn't say this to our great gentleman and my friend from Australia, because you have better health care than we do. But we are going to have great health care very soon. Obamacare is failing. The insurance companies are leaving, Aetna just announced, they're out from Obamacare. Some States, you look at a lot of States, a lot of different States, you look at Tennessee, you look at—Kentucky is now trouble, Iowa is in trouble. The insurance companies are all leaving. Obamacare is dead. So when you compare something to Obamacare, Obamacare is no longer living. And we have something that is going to be, I think, one of the best anywhere in the world, and we look forward to it.\nPresident Trump's Use of Social Media\nQ. Mr. President, can I ask you about your tweet on foreign policy and international issues. It's unconventional for a President. Is it an asset or a liability for your foreign policy?\nPresident Trump. Well, social media is the way to go. I have got over a hundred million people watching and social media to me is the way to go. And this way, if somebody's not treating you properly or if you do have, indeed, fake media—not all of it's fake; some of it's fantastic actually—but you can just sort of circumvent. But you know, I find, I don't know if you find that——\nPrime Minister Turnbull. Yes.\nPresident Trump. But I find social media is the way to go between the different forums. There are many different forums, but it is a fast way of getting the word out. I really think it helped today win on health care. I think it is a great way to communicate, and it is a modern way to communicate.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nPrime Minister Turnbull.

Thank you. Thank you very much to Vice President Mike Pence. I am very fortunate to have Mike with me. He's a man of very deep faith—I can tell you that—great character and conviction. And, Mike, thank you very much for making this journey with me and with all of us. Believe me, it's been great to have you.\nI also want to thank Pastor Jack Graham, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, and Rabbi Marvin Hier for leading us so beautifully in prayer. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nI also want to mention, as you know, Cardinal DiNardo and all of the other great faith leaders that we have. I see Franklin Graham. So many are here. So many great friends. So many great supporters. And we very much appreciate it. Because we're a nation of believers. Faith is deeply embedded into the history of our country, the spirit of our founding, and the soul of our Nation.\nIt is a beautiful thing to see three faith leaders, from three very different faith traditions, come together to lift up our Nation in prayer. And it's great to do it at the White House, isn't it? Isn't that great? Because not only are we a nation of faith, but we're a nation of tolerance. As we look at the violence around the world—and believe me, it's violent; I get to see it perhaps better than anybody—we realize how truly blessed we are to live in a nation that honors the freedom of worship. Today my administration is leading by example as we take historic steps to protect religious liberty in the United States of America.\nWe will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied, or silenced anymore. And we will never, ever stand for religious discrimination. Never, ever. Tolerance is the cornerstone of peace. And that is why I am proud to make a major and historic announcement this morning and to share with you that my first foreign trip as President of the United States will be to Saudi Arabia, then Israel, and then to a place that my cardinals love very much, Rome. [Laughter]\nThese visits will take place ahead of the NATO, G-7 meetings and will begin with a truly historic gathering in Saudi Arabia with leaders from all across the Muslim world. Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the two holiest sites in Islam, and it is there that we will begin to construct a new foundation of cooperation and support with our Muslim allies to combat extremism, terrorism, and violence and to embrace a more just and hopeful future for young Muslims in their countries. Our task is not to dictate to others how to live, but to build a coalition of friends and partners who share the goal of fighting terrorism and bringing safety, opportunity, and stability to the war-ravaged Middle East.\nWe all pray that we can make a difference. We pray for peace. Just over 150 years ago, President Lincoln called for a National Day of Prayer—today—after he feared that we were becoming a nation \"too proud to pray to the God that made us.\" Today we recall President Lincoln's words as we sign a proclamation designating today as National Day of Prayer. That's what we want, a National Day of Prayer. And it's so great to be doing it in the Rose Garden. How beautiful is that? It was looking like you'd never get here, folks, but you got here. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. So true.\nAnd we remember this eternal truth: Freedom is not a gift from government, freedom is a gift from God. It was Thomas Jefferson who said, \"The God who gave us life, gave us liberty.\" Our Founding Fathers believed that religious liberty was so fundamental that they enshrined it in the very First Amendment of our great and beloved Constitution.\nYet for too long, the Federal Government has used the power of the state as a weapon against people of faith, bullying and even punishing Americans for following their religious beliefs. That's been happening. That is why I am signing today an Executive order to defend the freedom of religion and speech in America: the freedoms that we've wanted, the freedoms that you fought for so long. And we are doing it in just a little while, right over here. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.\nNo American should be forced to choose between the dictates of the Federal Government and the tenets of their faith. As I campaigned across the country, faith leaders explained that they were prevented from speaking their minds because of a 1954 rule known as the Johnson Amendment. I spoke about it a lot. Under this rule, if a pastor, priest, or imam speaks about issues of public or political importance, they are threatened with the loss of their tax-exempt status, a crippling financial punishment. Very, very unfair. But no longer.\nI promised to take action, if I won. If I didn't win, I gave you no promise, that's for sure. [Laughter] If I didn't win, I guess I'd be gone, right? I'd be out enjoying my life, I think. [Laughter] But I wouldn't be helping you with the Johnson Amendment. And to this end, this financial threat against the faith community is over.\nIn just a few moments, I will be signing an Executive order to follow through on that pledge and to prevent the Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights. And you're the people I want to listen to. Other people are allowed to tell me and everybody what to do. I want to hear it from you and so do a lot of other people. So you're now in a position where you can say what you want to say. And I know you'll only say good, and you'll say what's in your heart. And that's what we want from you. You are great, great people. You are great, great people. Thank you. Thank you.\nThis Executive order directs the IRS not to unfairly target churches and religious organizations for political speech. No one should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors. And I know one thing, it never stopped Dr. Ben Carson. He said, the heck with the Johnson Amendment. Right, Ben? [Laughter] I've been with Ben, and he did what he wanted to do. [Laughter] But not everybody is going to do that, Ben, you know that, right?\nIn America, we do not fear people speaking freely from the pulpit, we embrace it. America has a rich tradition of social change beginning in our pews and our pulpits. Perhaps there is no greater example than the historic role of the African American church as the agent for social progress, spurring our Nation to greater justice and equality. We must never infringe on the noble tradition of change from the church and progress from the pew. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nUnder my administration, free speech does not end at the steps of a cathedral or a synagogue or any other house of worship. We are giving our churches their voices back. We are giving them back in the highest form. With this Executive order, we also make clear that the Federal Government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs.\nThat is why I am today directing the Department of Justice to develop new rules to ensure these religious protections are afforded to all Americans. There are—more than 50 religious Americans and groups sued the previous—and you've seen that—50 sued the previous administration for violating their religious freedom. The abuses were widespread. The abuses were all over. As just one example, people were forbidden from giving or receiving religious items at a military hospital where our brave servicemembers were being treated and where they wanted those religious items. These were great, great people. These are great soldiers. They wanted those items. They were precluded from getting them.\nAnd we know all too well the attacks against the Little Sisters of the Poor, incredible nuns who care for the sick, the elderly, and the forgotten. Where are they, by the way? Where are they? Could you stand, Sisters? Stand. Come on up here, Sister. Come on up. Right? Come on up.\nLittle Sisters of the Poor Mother Provincial Loraine Maguire. Nice to meet you.\nThe President. So nice. Congratulations. They, sort of, just won a lawsuit. That was pretty good. [Laughter] That's a good way of doing it, huh?\nWell, I want you to know that your long ordeal will soon be over, okay?\nSister Maguire. Thank you so much.\nThe President. It's been a long, hard ordeal. We've all been watching. Some of you have been very much involved. A lot of us have been watching the news for years.\nSister Maguire. Five years.\nThe President. Five years. You had good lawyers?\nSister Maguire. Excellent. The best, the best.\nThe President. Where are your lawyers? Stand up. Come on, stand up. Good job. Do you mind if I use your lawyers for various things? I could use some good lawyers too. [Laughter] Good job. Great job.\nWith this Executive order, we are ending the attacks on your religious liberty, and we are proudly reaffirming America's leadership role as a Nation that protects religious freedom for everyone. [Applause] Okay? Great.\nOver 60 years ago, the IRS went after one of the greatest leaders in history, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. It is a sobering reminder of the need for vigilance. The words of Reverend King and other religious leaders have awakened the conscience of millions and millions of Americans, and inspired us to act in the name of peace, justice, freedom, and charity. Every President must work to protect—and we have to do this; we have no choice to do this. We have absolutely no choice—to protect these hard-fought gains. They have been hard fought. They have been fought for so many years, for so many decades, for so many centuries. And this is a very special day, perhaps, for that reason.\nAnd that's why we are here today: To defend the rights of all Americans, to honor our great Constitution, and to protect the sacred liberties given to us not by any earthly power, but by our Creator in heaven.\nI'd like to thank all of you great, great religious leaders for being with us today. We have some of our political leaders. You can have them. [Laughter] They know, they know. And today is a very big day. We have a big vote coming up in a little while. And I thought it was very appropriate that it turned out to be you folks, and then I have to deal with those politicians. [Laughter] But they're good. I will tell you, they're good. They work very hard, and hopefully, we're going to have a wonderful day and a wonderful vote, and we're going to take care of a lot of people—great, great people from this country—with their health care, their health care needs. And we hope to be able to do that. And we have all fought very hard to be able to do that.\nSo I want to say to everybody in attendance and everybody in our country and everybody in the world: God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. [At this point, the President moved to the signing desk.]\nOkay. This is National Day of Prayer. We like that, don't we? National Day of Prayer proclamation.\n[The President signed the proclamation.]\nThank you very much. So who's getting this pen, Mr. Vice President? Huh?\nAlveda C. King, niece of Martin Luther King, Jr. I'll take it. [Laughter]\nParticipant. Ms. King.\nThe President. How about in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King? Is that a good gift for her?\nMs. King. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. God Bless you.\nThe President. Thank you very much.\nThis is promoting and the promotion of free speech and religious liberty. That's a big one. That's as big as it gets, right?\n[The President signed the Executive order.]\nVice President Michael R. Pence. I'd say Paula deserves that one.\nThe President. Where is Paula?\nPrestonwood Baptist Church Pastor Jack Graham. Right behind you sir.\nThe President. Paula? You've worked—she's worked so hard.\nPastor Graham. Absolutely.\nNew Destiny Christian Center Senior Pastor Paula White-Cain. Thank you.\nThe President. Two years, she has worked so hard.\nPastor White-Cain. Thanks so much.\nThe President. Thank you very much, everybody. Fantastic to have you. We really appreciate. Very special. These are two very, very special executive orders, and an honor to have everybody here. Thank you all.", "timestamp": "2017-05-04", "title": "Remarks on Signing a Proclamation on the National Day of Prayer and an Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty"}

Great honor. And thank you to my very good friend, Rupert Murdoch—there's only one Rupert, that we know—but for helping to keep this history alive—and he's been working on this for a long time; he loves Australia—and for the next generation. And thanks also to the legendary, talented golfer, Greg Norman. I used to think I was a great player. Then I played with Greg one time, and I said, well, I'm not going to play golf for a living. [Laughter] He me a lot of time, I'll tell you that. [Laughter]\nAnd thank you to everyone here tonight for helping us to honor and remember those very brave souls who answered the call of freedom. Also to Anthony Pratt, who just pledged $2 billion—and that's peanuts for Anthony, if you know Anthony. [Laughter] Come on, Anthony, you can do better than that. [Laughter] Thank you. Thank you very much, Anthony. That's beautiful.\nIt's really a special privilege to be back on the Intrepid and to address both American and Australian heroes. Melania and I are thrilled to be joined by a very, very special Prime Minister and his wonderful wife Lucy, who I've just gotten to know. And you know, they said we had a rough phone call. We really didn't have a rough phone call, did we? [Laughter] Everyone is talking about this phone call. The media was saying, what do you think about the phone call? You didn't really hang up. No, we had actually a very nice call, right? Good. Now the record is straight, all of those people back there. [Laughter] Thank goodness. [Laughter] It's true. We had a very nice phone—got a little testy. It got a little bit testy, but that's okay. We've had a very good relationship, and I'm very proud of the relationship. Thank you very much, Malcolm.\nThe Prime Minister and I just finished a productive discussion about the interests of our two countries. Together we discussed crucial issues ranging from national security to trade, to immigration and enhanced economic cooperation. We reaffirmed the tremendous friendship between the United States and Australia and the vital importance of our security and our alliance.\nThe Armed Forces of our two nations are operating side-by-side almost every day, fighting to defeat ISIS and the scourge of terrorism. And we will eradicate terrorism. To every man and woman who has served America and Australia in uniform, two proud nations salute you, believe me.\nThere is no better place to remember the importance of military readiness than this ship. It was laid down just 1 week before the tragic—and the tragedy of Pearl Harbor and helped secure freedom in its hour of need.\nI was proud to share the news that this week, my administration reached a historic deal with Congress to end the devastating cuts to the United States military. I don't know what they were thinking when they started cutting, but we've got it all coming back, and big league, believe me. [Laughter] It's coming back fast, ordering lots of planes, lots of ships. Lots of jobs too, by the way. We will add more than $25 billion for national defense in a short period of time, and we will ensure that our service members have the equipment, tools, training, and resources that they need and that they so richly deserve. But security also requires friends that you can truly count on. That is why I was pleased to meet with Prime Minister Turnbull, and why I'm so glad to be here with you tonight. And we had a great meeting just a little while ago.\nI want to thank the American Australian Association for hosting this event, which I've been contributing to, by the way, for years through Rupert. [Laughter] Every year. He'd send me this letter, could you please give money? I say, what do I have to do with that, Rupert? And I'd just keep sending him money, money. And now I realize that was money well spent. That's great. Right, Rupert? For years, I've been doing my thing for Rupert. And for its decades of work to strengthen the ties between our two countries. They've done a great job. America and Australia are old friends and, really, natural partners, and with your help, we will remain so for a very, very long time to come.\nOur two nations were born as the rebellious children of the same parent. [Laughter] It's a very interesting statement. I've heard that before, too, about people. And for nearly a century, Americans and Australians have fought together, bled together, and died together as brothers and sisters. Since the First World War, when Australians led Americans in the Battle of the Hummel, our brave warriors have fought shoulder to shoulder in every major conflict together. Their righteous cause has always been the same: the safety of our citizens and the survival of our freedom. From the beaches of Normandy—a vicious, vicious fight—to the jungles of Vietnam and the desert landscapes of the Middle East—where lots of progress, believe it or not, after all these years, is being made—Americans have had no better friends than the Australians. I mean that.\nWe are proudly and profoundly grateful for Australia's contributions in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and their help in the fight against terrorism following the terrible attacks of September 11. On behalf of the United States, I thank the Australian people tonight. Believe me, I have so many friends here from this country, and we love Australia, all of us. We really love Australia. Thank you very much.\nI know there are many Active Duty service personnel from both nations with us in the audience, and I want to express our gratitude to each and every one of you. We are privileged to be joined by many amazing veterans from our two countries as well, and for, really, from so many different conflicts. There are so many conflicts that we fought on and worked on together—and by the way, in all cases, succeeded on. It's nice to win. [Laughter] It's nice to win. [Laughter] And we've won a lot, haven't we, Mr. Prime Minister? We've won a lot. We're going to keep it going, by the way. [Laughter]\nYou've given your love and loyalty to your nations, and tonight a room of grateful patriots says thank you. We are especially honored by the presence tonight of seven World War II veterans. And we've been talking about them all night, but I should mention their name once again, perhaps for the final time tonight, or we can keep mentioning them because they're worth it. And their names again: John Hancock, Derek Holyoake, Gordon Johnson, Norm Tame, Wendell Thrasher, Roger Spooner, and Bill White. Great, great people. [Applause] Great.\nThese men stood at the breach in the battle to save civilization. And their sacrifice kept us free. Exactly 75 years ago this week, these men saw that historic battle with their own eyes. And we've also covered that very, very vicious, violent battle. But this is a little bit of a different description. But the end result was the same: We won. We won. They saw enemy planes flying toward them by the dozen, they saw the flames erupt into the air, and they saw the true cost of war in the faces of the heroes that never returned. On this special gathering, on this special night, we remember the courage of these men and every man, Australian and American, who fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea.\nThe count of the dead goes on and on. And the number of wounded do not even begin to describe the toughness of the fight and their incredible sacrifice. But perhaps in the story of just one man, we can hope to get a small glimpse of its measure. It is the story of Lieutenant Jack Powers, a Navy flyer. He grew up just miles from here in a modest apartment in Washington Heights, right up the road. He then went on to the United States Naval Academy, incredible place. There, his roommate said of Jack: \"Never trust him to respect conventionalities.\" Because he wasn't a conventional person, to put it mildly. \"He's a hilarious rebel and his own man. You'll like him\"—and really like him a lot, but you know what, he's just a different kind of a guy. In other words, he was a New Yorker. [Laughter]\nBy the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jack had already served 6 years in the Navy. In the 6 months that followed, the Allies suffered many defeats and many, many casualties. Japan captured footholds all across the Pacific and now was closing—and really fast—closing in on Australia. In May 1942, the invasion fleet moved on Port Moresby, the vital base just a few hundred miles from Australian shores. It was there, off the coast, that American and Australian ships met the enemy in the Coral Sea.\nOn the morning of May 7, Jack Powers launched his Dauntless dive bomber from the depth and deck of the Yorktown. He was some flyer—I can tell you that—some great flyer. Soon, he dived straight at an enemy carrier and dropped his bomb so low, he was almost caught in the blast, and he was badly hurt. But he escaped, and the carrier sank.\nThat night, on the Yorktown, Jack urged the other pilots to take the same risk. He said, that's the way you do it, that's the way you win, that's the way you sink them, whatever the cost, even if it costs you your lives. That's the way you sink the ship.\nThe next morning he pressed his point again: \"Remember,\" he said, \"the folks back home are counting on us. I'm going to get a hit if I have to lay it down right next to that flight deck.\" In their courage, they turned the tide of the Pacific war. They had tremendous success. They were knocking out ship after ship.\nThat day Jack flew his plane to another carrier, straight into a hail of oncoming lead and fire, to land a devastating blow on its deck. Seconds later, the colossal blast—the one Jack was talking about and saying, we have to take the risk—engulfed his plane, and Jack was gone. He was dead. He was brave, but what a job he did.\nSometime before Jack died, he sent a wire home to his father in New York. It read: \"Dear Dad. One thousand miles away doesn't make any difference. . . .Your bad son is thinking of you, hoping that he is worthy of being called a chip off the old block.\" His father was a tough cookie also.\nNow it is we who are thinking of Jack, and all those brave souls who fought alongside of him—with that incredible form of attack—and especially those who found their final resting place beneath the waters where they waged that greatest of battles. They lost their lives in the fires of war, but gained immortality through their sacrifice. And now, 75 years later, we hope that we are worthy of their deeds in the beautiful, beautiful Coral Sea. We hope to be worthy of the sacrifices made by every servicemember who has fought in our name, past and present.\nThe men who fought the Second World War saw terrible things, horrible things, deathly things, but they also witnessed spectacular valor and bravery. And from the wreckage of that horrible war, they rebuilt their nations and launched civilization to new heights. They knew that together, free people can achieve extraordinary things and that one hero can make all of the difference in the world.\nIn those Pacific waters, we forged iron bonds between our two countries. Few peoples in the world share ties in history, affection, and culture like the Americans and the Australians. Few, believe me. Those ties were sealed with the blood of our fathers and grandfathers, and those same ties are now the priceless heritage we celebrate so beautifully tonight.\nSo, with love for our two nations, with pride in our shared history, and with faith in Almighty God, we renew our old friendship, and we pledge our lasting partnership in the search for prosperity and everlasting peace.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. I'm honored that you're here. I'm honored that Mrs. Turnbull is here. And I'm honored that everybody in this room is with us to realize what a great, great relationship our two nations have together.\nGod bless you, God bless our fallen heroes, God bless the Australian people, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, all.", "timestamp": "2017-05-04", "title": "Remarks at a Dinner Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea in New York City"}

The ad was first released on Monday, May 1.

In the address, the President referred to H.R. 1628.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124189", "text": "My fellow Americans, since day one, my administration has been hard at work, tearing down the barriers to job creation and economic growth. We have removed one job-killing regulation after another; they're not pretty, and they're going. And believe me, we are just getting started on regulations. They're gone.\nOn Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all. It's called Obamacare; perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, Obamacare is collapsing. The House bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster and replace it with more choices and more freedom for American families. Most importantly, it will be great health care, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down. So you'll have better health care at a lower cost. And now I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing Obamacare will be a big, big win for the American people.\nLast week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the U.S.A. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher. And we're bringing them down, and I mean way down.\nI am proposing, actually, the single largest tax cut in American history. Our tax relief will be focused on the middle class, including much-needed relief for low- and middle-income parents raising children.\nAs we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American industry. Right now America's businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries. And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it. We want to turn our country into a jobs machine, a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brandnew, beautiful business.\nAnd that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today's high taxes on American business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth, and we're not going to allow it any longer.\nAlong with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.\nThe complexity of the Tax Code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that's what it is; it's an army of lawyers and lobbyists or accountants. Other people can do it; you can't. And it's not fair to ask you to even think about it. That is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions, and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy.\nJust weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on tax day; they were reminded again how much they give to Washington. We believe everyday Americans know better how to spend their own money than the Federal bureaucracy, and we want to help them keep as much of that hard-earned money as we can. Tax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals—and we're going to make them fair, but even really good again for our country and for our workers—all of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.\nTogether, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers and so good for our families.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-05-05", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

An original was not available for verification of the content of this statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124186", "text": "Today I have signed into law H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, which authorizes appropriations that fund the operation of the Federal Government through September 30, 2017.\nCertain provisions of this bill (e.g., Division C, sections 8049, 8058, 8077, 8081, and 8116; Division J, under the heading \"Contribution for International Peacekeeping Activities\") would, in certain circumstances, unconstitutionally limit my ability to modify the command and control of military personnel and materiel or unconstitutionally vest final decision-making authority in my military advisers. Further, Division B, section 527; Division C, section 8101; and Division F, section 517 each restrict the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States; Division C, section 8103 restricts the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries and does not include an exception for when a court might order the release of a detainee to certain countries. I will treat these, and similar provisions, consistently with my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.\nCertain provisions (e.g., Division C, sections 8040, 8075, 8114, 9005, 9011, 9014, and under the headings \"Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide,\" \"Afghanistan Security Forces Fund,\" \"Counter-ISIL Train and Equip Fund,\" and \"Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Fund\") require advance notice to the Congress before the President may direct certain military actions or provide certain forms of military assistance. In approving this bill, I wish to reiterate the longstanding understanding of the executive branch that these types of provisions encompass only military actions for which providing advance notice is feasible and consistent with my constitutional authority and duty as Commander in Chief to protect national security.\nNumerous provisions could, in certain circumstances, interfere with the exercise of my constitutional authorities to negotiate international agreements (e.g., Division B, sections 509, 519, 530; Division J, sections 7010(c), 7013(a), 7025(c), 7029, 7031(e)(2), 7037, 7042, 7043, 7044, 7045, 7048, 7060, 7070, and 7071), to receive ambassadors (e.g., Division J, section 7031(c)), and to recognize foreign governments (e.g., Division J, section 7070(b)(2)(A)). My Administration will treat each of these provisions consistently with my constitutional authorities in the area of foreign relations.\nDivision E, section 622 prohibits the use of funds to pay the salaries and expenses for several advisory positions in the White House. The President has well-established authority to supervise and oversee the executive branch and to obtain advice in furtherance of this supervisory authority. The President also has the prerogative to obtain advice that will assist him in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities, not only from executive branch officials and employees outside the White House, but also from advisers within it. Legislation that significantly impedes my ability to supervise or obtain the views of appropriate senior advisers violates the separation of powers by undermining my ability to exercise my constitutional responsibilities, including to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. My Administration will, therefore, construe section 622 consistently with these Presidential prerogatives.\nDivision B, section 537 provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories. I will treat this provision consistently with my constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\nSeveral provisions (e.g., Division C, section 10006(b); Division D, section 401; Division J, section 7041(b)(3); Division N, sections 310, 311, 402, 502(d), and 503) mandate or regulate the submission of certain executive branch information to the Congress. I will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with my constitutional authority to withhold information that could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the executive branch, or the performance of my constitutional duties. In particular, Division E, section 713(1) and (2) prohibits the use of appropriations to pay the salary of any Federal officer or employee who interferes with or prohibits certain official communications between Federal employees and Members of Congress or who takes adverse action against an officer or employee because of such communications. I will construe these provisions not to apply to any circumstances that would detract from my authority to supervise, control, and correct employees' communications with the Congress related to their official duties, including in cases where such communications would be unlawful or could reveal confidential information protected by executive privilege.\nDivision C, section 8009 prohibits the use of funds to initiate a special access program unless the congressional defense committees receive 30 days' advance notice. The President's authority to classify and control access to information bearing on the national security flows from the Constitution and does not depend upon a legislative grant of authority. Although I expect to be able to provide the advance notice contemplated by section 8009 in most situations as a matter of comity, situations may arise in which I must act promptly while protecting certain extraordinarily sensitive national security information. In these situations, I will treat these sections in a manner consistent with my constitutional authorities, including as Commander in Chief.\nSeveral provisions (e.g., Division C, section 8134; Division J, section 7063; and Division K, section 418) prohibit the use of funds to deny an Inspector General access to agency records or documents. I will construe these, and similar provisions, consistently with my authority to control the dissemination of information protected by executive privilege.\nSeveral provisions prohibit the use of funds to recommend legislation to the Congress (e.g., Division A, section 716; Division C, sections 8005, 8014, 8070(a)(2), 8076; and Division H, section 210), or require recommendations of legislation to the Congress (e.g., Division C, section 8012(b), 8035(b); Division F, section 532; Division G, sections 101, 102, and a proviso under the heading \"Administrative Provisions—Forest Service\"; Division N, sections 605(c) and 610). Because the Constitution gives the President the authority to recommend \"such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient\" (Article II, section 3), my Administration will continue to treat these, and similar provisions, as advisory and non-binding.\nNumerous provisions authorize congressional committees to veto a particular use of appropriated funds (e.g., Division C, section 8058), or condition the authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of congressional committees (e.g., Division A, sections 702, 706, and 717; Division D, sections 101(a) and 201(a); Division G, sections 403 and 409; Division K, sections 188, 222, 405 and 406). These are impermissible forms of congressional aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by enactment of statutes. My Administration will notify the relevant committees before taking the specified actions and will accord the recommendations of such committees all appropriate and serious consideration, but it will not treat spending decisions as dependent on the approval of congressional committees.\nMy Administration shall treat provisions that allocate benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender (e.g., Division B, under the heading \"Minority Business Development\"; Division C, sections 8016, 8021, 8038, and 8042; Division H, under the headings \"Departmental Management Salaries and Expenses,\" \"School Improvement Programs,\" and \"Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program Account\"; Division K, under the heading \"Native American Housing Block Grants\"; and Division K, section 213) in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.\nDONALD J.

Preparing for weather-related disasters can dramatically reduce their impact on you, your family, and your community.\nThe 2017 hurricane season, which begins June 1 and lasts through November 30, marks the 25th anniversaries of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew tore through South Florida before making landfall, again, in Louisiana. It claimed 65 lives, destroyed 25,000 homes, and caused approximately $26 billion in overall damage. A few weeks later, Hurricane Iniki struck the Hawaiian Island of Kauai, killing six, demolishing 1,400 homes, and causing about $1.8 billion in overall damage. The tragic losses caused by those terrible storms remind us of the need to prepare for the destruction hurricanes can bring.\nAs Hurricane Andrew demonstrated, inland areas are not immune from the destruction hurricanes can bring with them through flooding rains and other related weather events. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study of Hurricane Andrew revealed that most of the damage it caused was inland from the primary storm surge areas. Just last year, heavy rains from Hurricane Matthew caused destructive flooding and loss of life in the Carolinas, even though the hurricane's eye remained mostly offshore.\nThis week, through several initiatives, I am encouraging Americans to take the time to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season. After a major disaster, you may not have immediate access to the services you are accustomed to, such as clean water, grocery stores, and emergency services. Hurricane preparedness information provided by the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Ready campaign conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), both available online, outline important steps you can take right now to safeguard your family, pets, and property. These resources will help you create evacuation and communications plans and assemble a disaster kit of necessary supplies. Developing and implementing these plans will save lives and avoid excess damage.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7 through May 13, 2017, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon Americans living in hurricane-prone areas to observe this week by making use of the online resources provided by the NWS and FEMA and by taking actions to safeguard their families, homes, and businesses from the dangers of hurricanes. I also call upon Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management officials to help inform our communities about hurricane preparedness and response, in order to help prevent storm damage and save lives.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Their daily effort keeps our Government functioning and helps make our Nation exceptional.\nThroughout my first 100 days, I have seen the tremendous work civil servants do to fulfill our duty to the American people. At all levels of government, our public servants put our country and our people first. The hard work of our mail carriers, teachers, firefighters, transit workers, and many more, creates an environment that allows individuals and companies to thrive.\nTo empower our civil servants to best help others, the Government must always operate more efficiently and more securely. In March, I issued an Executive Order on a Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch. I am counting on our civil servants to seize upon that order and make our Government dramatically more accountable, effective, and efficient, by going beyond the modernization efforts of the past and re-examining the operational core of our executive departments and agencies. Together, through these and other efforts, we will fulfill our responsibilities to make our Government work better for the American people.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

Aren't they really something? Great job. (Applause.)\nWell, today it is my great honor on behalf of the First Family here on National Military Appreciation Month to welcome so many heroes to this special place. And on behalf of the President of the United States of America, welcome to the White House. (Applause.)\nAlso thank you to Secretary Shulkin for that great introduction. Thank you for the job you're doing day in and day out to help America's heroes and to meet the obligation that we've made to our veterans. Would you join me in thanking the Secretary of Veterans of Affairs for bringing about transformational change at the VA? (Applause.)\nAnd also can I just invite you to give a big round of applause to the Second Lady of the United States of America, my wife of 31 years and a Marine Corps mom, Karen Pence? (Applause.)\nIt's deeply humbling for me to be here today with all the guardians who are gathered here, with the members of Honor Flight Northern Colorado. I'd especially like you to give a round of applause to Colonel Stanley Cass, the President of this great organization. Stanley, where are you? Great job. (Applause.)\nThe men and women who've worn the uniform of the United States are our most cherished citizens. You are the patriots of the highest order. You stood up. You stepped forward to protect our nation and the values that we hold dear.\nNow, many of you served in Vietnam where amidst the jungles and the rice paddies you stood tall and proud, your image seared into the mind of the American people, an everlasting sign of unwavering courage in the unquenchable spirit of the American people. To all of our Vietnam veterans, let me say, welcome home. (Applause.)\nAlso many of you stepped ashore in Korea, where you fought to protect the freedom of that ancient land and establish a foundation of peace and prosperity that exists today. My father was one of you. You heard Secretary Shulkin mention it. My dad wore the uniform, served in combat, Korea. I have to tell you it was deeply humbling for me to stand along the DMZ and look out over the landscape and have General Brooks tell me that right over those few hills was Mount Baldy and Pork Chop Hill where my dad had fought. Let me tell you what, I can attest having seen it firsthand, our Korean War veterans in the room won the freedom of millions of people of Korea, and it prospers to this day in South Korea. Thank you for your service. (Applause.)\nAnd today as we celebrate the 72nd anniversary of V-E Day, Victory in Europe Day, it's an honor and privilege -- more than I can say -- to be here with so many who fought in the greatest conflict of the 20th century, and who won freedom in World War Two.\nYou served your country in a way and at a time that challenged each one of you to step up the perseveration of our way of life. With you in the vanguard, America was able to stand as a beacon for freedom. Our nation marshaled every ounce of our strength to save freedom across the Atlantic, across the Pacific, and across the very world. The sons and daughters of America, and, indeed, all who call themselves free will remember your names for eternity, until the world stops turning. To all of you who won a victory in World War Two, you have the undying thanks and gratitude of the American people. (Applause.)\nYou know, it's especially humbling for me to stand before you today because I was not a soldier. As you already heard, I'm the son of a soldier, and I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. (Applause.) And I must tell you, to stand before so many who stepped forward in times of great trial in the life of this nation, and served with great distinction and great selfless courage is deeply inspiring to us all.\nAnd let me also say, even though some of you back there have hair the same color as mine -- (laughter) -- I want you to say on this Honor Flight, it's not how I see you. I know, in the truth of it, that you went to war as boys and you became men, and those men won freedom, and we will never, ever forget your service to this nation. God bless you all. (Applause.)\nSo let me recognize just a few of the heroes in the room, although every single one of you wearing those hats that mark your service are heroes, and that's what these Honor Flights are really all about. You know, the old book says, if you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect. And all the people that makes these Honor Flights possible know that this is just about paying a debt of honor and a debt of gratitude that our nation will never be able to fully repay to all of you. But we hope this experience fills your hearts with the absolute assurance that we'll never forget what you've done for us.\nPeople like Lieutenant Colonel William Thousand (ph), himself a United States Marine who fought for America for more than a quarter century in the Pacific during World War Two, in Korea, and in Vietnam. Is he here with us today? Let's give him a big round of applause. (Applause.)\nI think of others like Colonel Edwin Bogey (ph), of the United States Air Force who flew for freedom in the 8th Fighter-Bomb Wing from 1950 to 1978. Or Private David Fager (ph), U.S. Army, wore a green beret and now wears a Purple Heart, two Bronze Stars, and 12 gleaming medals on his chest. These are all veterans I've had the privilege to know of, to know their experience.\nThe truth is, no matter where you served, every last one of you fought on the frontlines of freedom. And because of that, because of you, freedom endures to this very day. You are among the rest of us, but make no mistake about it, you are the best of us. And on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I'm here to say thanks and to salute your service. (Applause.)\nBut know that you have more than just our thanks. Under President Donald Trump, you a have a leader -- a tireless defender of our American military and our veterans. A Commander-in-Chief who I promise you is fighting every single day for all of you to keep America safe and keep our promises to those who have served in the uniform of the United States.\nYou know, as the proud father of an American servicemember, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is so committed to the men and women of our armed forces, to their families, to our veterans.\nYou know, it was about a month ago I had the privilege to stand with President Trump as he welcomed wounded warriors to the White House East Room. As he looked out at those courageous men and women, he told them that they had, in his words, carved their place into the history of our country and into our hearts. And so have you.\nYou know, that's why President Donald Trump has taken decisive action, as Secretary Shulkin just described, to defend those who defended us. The President has said from very early on, even when he was a candidate, that our veterans deserve the best care in the world, the finest care America can provide. Just over a week ago, President Trump signed an executive order to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is as efficient, effective, and accountable as any great healthcare provider in America. We're going to give those who served most the best healthcare system in the world. (Applause.)\nAnd last month, President Trump signed into law the Veterans Choice Act to give our heroes the choices they deserve for world-class healthcare. You know, the President said it out on the campaign trail -- I was with him, it was early in the campaign -- and he said, here's the deal, we're going to reform the VA and make sure that every veteran has the benefits that they have earned in the uniform of the United States. And if a VA clinic or VA hospital can't give you the best healthcare that you deserve in real time, we're going to give you the opportunity to go across the street and get the healthcare that you need. And the President just signed a bill that will do just that. (Applause.)\nYou know, I can tell you firsthand, President Trump is a man of his word and he's a man of action. This President is a strong leader. He's putting America first each and every day. He's defending our veterans, and he's also taking a strong stand for America's rightful place as the leader of the free world. He's been fighting every day since the outset of this administration to give our armed forces the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe.\nThe President's leadership was on full display at the end of last week. If you didn't notice it, President Trump actually managed to sign into law legislation that, in the balance of this fiscal year will increase defense spending by $21 billion. (Applause.)\nThis is the biggest investment in military readiness in nearly a decade, and we're just getting started. This was a victory for the American people and for our national security. And it was also a victory on policy. For more than the last six years, Congress has actually required that any increase any increase in funding for military spending should be matched with an increase in spending in other areas of government. It was in many ways like Congress kind of held military spending in abeyance until there could be more spending on more government programs. They called it the parity rule, and it actually contributed to a neglect of our armed forces at a critical time of mounting threats around the globe. But no longer.\nThanks to President Trump's strong leadership, national defense is now coming first. And we were able to increase defense spending with the largest investment in years without requiring an additional increase in domestic spending putting an additional burden on taxpayers. That's real progress for taxpayers and our military. (Applause.)\nBut, friends, the President has only begun to fight. President Trump in the budget that will be considered this fall has actually proposed one of the largest increases in defense spending since the days of President Ronald Reagan. Under his leadership, I know the strongest fighting force in the history of the world will be stronger still. And I want to promise you -- President Trump will not rest and will not relent until we at last give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources they need to accomplish their mission, defend our nation, and come home safe. That's our pledge to all of you. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has committed to rebuild our military to restore the arsenal of democracy. As history will attest, when America is strong, the American people are safe, and the world is more secure.\nI was reflecting on this just last month. On behalf of the President, as I mentioned, I traveled to a frontier of freedom on the Korean Peninsula, a land where my father had served in uniform. Sixty-five years ago, a young Edward J. Pence left his home in Illinois and crossed the vast Pacific, like so many of you in this room did.\nHe was a second lieutenant at the time, 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army, landed on the shores of South Korea, rifle in his hand. And I stood, as I mentioned, at the Demilitarized Zone. I looked out at the landscape where Dad and his fellow soldiers had fought and fought valiantly to earn the freedom of the people of South Korea.\nNow, my dad got a Bronze Star. In fact, I arrived in Korea on the very day -- didn't we, dear? -- on the very day that sixty-five years ago to the day my dad had had a Bronze Star pinned on his chest. But when my three brothers and I and two sisters were growing up, that medal that now I proudly display in my office in the White House was in the drawer. And the truth was that my dad didn't consider himself a hero. Any time you'd ask him about the war, he'd say the heroes were the ones that didn't come home.\nAnd there's a burden that those of you that have seen combat bear that I'll never fully understand, but I respect. See, my dad got to come home. He got to marry his sweetheart, got to raise six irascible kids, see them all get an education, and go on. Now, Dad has been gone 29 years now, but I'll always have the sense that over the course of his life, my dad never really quite understood why he got to come home and some of his closest friends didn't. That's the burden that those of you that have worn the uniform bear. You see the sacrifices firsthand. It's not statistics, it's friends. It's not ranks, it's relationships long gone, but voices and faces never forgotten. It's part of the burden that you bear, as those that have served in the uniform of the United States. And it's a burden that on behalf of President Donald Trump, I'm here to honor today and to pledge to each one of you that those that are wearing the uniform today will never have a better friend in the Oval Office than President Donald Trump.\nIn this administration, we're going to work and work hard each and every day to ensure that our military personnel have the resources they need to accomplish their mission in their time, as you had the resources to accomplish your mission in your time.\nWe're going to see to our veterans to make sure that the promises that you earned in uniform are kept by the American people. And we're never going to hesitate, and this small moment today here on the White House grounds I hope is evidence of that -- we're never going to hesitate to honor those who've served, to pay a debt of honor and gratitude to all of you who in your moment, in your time said, yes, to America. And because you said, yes, freedom prevails to this day.\nSo on behalf of the President of the United States of America, I say from my heart, thank you for your service. God bless you all and God bless the United States.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124234", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:13 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. I want to thank Sarah for standing in for me on Friday. She did a great job. I missed you all tremendously. (Laughter.) Now that I realize that we can do that a little more I'll spend a little more time at the Pentagon.\nI moved this up a little bit -- I appreciate your flexibility today so that the pool has enough time to cover the Vice President and Secretary Shulkin as they welcome Honor Flight our veterans to Washington on the anniversary of VA Day. The Vice President is hosting more than 120 veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War as part of National Military Appreciation Month, and Public Service Recognition Week, highlighting the Trump administration's commitment to our military and public service.\nAlso today, the Vice President, Secretary Price, Secretary Shulkin all attended an event on the scientific opportunities in biomedicine. Key leaders from government, the private sector and academia discussed the United States' comprehensive biomedical landscape and further educated White House staff, including assistants to the President, Ivanka Trump and Reed Cordish, on this important topic.\nThe meeting was organized by the National Institutes of Health and was led by its director, Dr. Francis Collins. Leaders in the medical, education and research joined executives from companies who invest in biotech to provide analysis and real-life examples of how America's sustained leadership in the biomedical industry has resulted in immeasurable benefits to both our country's economic and physical well-being.\nAmong the participants were Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Dr. Craig Thompson, the president of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Dr. Cornelia Bargmann, the president of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative;\nDr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, president of Stanford University; and Dr. Rick Lifton, the president of Rockefeller University.\nThe United States currently sits atop the list of global investors in innovation in the life sciences, responsible for 44 percent of global research and development. This investment is dependent on the NIH and the important research it funds. In order to maintain our international leadership in biomedicine, we must strengthen the partnerships between government agencies, investors, academics, the bio-pharma industry and research foundations. This meeting was an important step in reinforcing that essential cooperation.\nMoving on, I'm pleased to announce that today, shortly after this briefing, we will release a list of the President's third wave of federal court nominees. These 10 individuals that the President has chosen were chosen for their deep knowledge of the law and their commitment to upholding constitutional principles.\nTwo of the nominees today came from the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that the President released during the campaign. If confirmed, Justice Joan Larsen will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Justice Larsen is currently serving on the Michigan Supreme Court. And Justice David Stras will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. He currently serves as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court.\nThe campaign list was put together from the Heritage Foundation, as well as the Federalist Society. And as the President said last September when it was released, these \"highly respected people are the kind of scholars that we need to preserve the very core of our country and make it greater than ever before.\" The President followed the principles that were used to guide that list to select the additional eight individuals. And as I mentioned, the full list should be out very shortly.\nIn terms of the President's schedule for today, this morning he met with his National Security Advisor, General McMaster. He also spoke with the French President-elect to congratulate him on his victory. A readout of that call should be out very shortly. The Prime Minister of Georgia was also at the White House, meeting with the Vice President. The Prime Minister then dropped by with the Vice President into the Oval Office to greet the President. And earlier this afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President.\nIn about an hour, he'll meet with Secretary of State Tillerson. Secretary Tillerson has also been meeting with several foreign leaders today at the State Department, including the Prime Minister of Montenegro, the Foreign Minister of Slovakia, and the Foreign Minister of Qatar.\nSecretary Mattis is also meeting with many foreign leaders during his European trip this week to reaffirm key United States military alliances. The Secretary is in Denmark to co-host a meeting with the Danish Minister of Defense, with senior leaders from 15 countries that are key contributors to the ISIS military campaign.\nWhile in Copenhagen, Secretary Mattis will also meet separately with the Minister of Defense to discuss European security and the importance of the NATO Alliance, and with the Danish Prime Minister to reaffirm the close ties between Denmark and the United States.\nIn other Cabinet news, Secretary Zinke is in Utah today, continuing his four-day listening tour on the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, putting into action President Trump's April 27th executive order to review these monuments. Secretary Zinke will be accompanied by the governor and a number of Utah's congressional delegation and local stakeholders for a morning aerial tour of the million-plus-acre monument and an afternoon hiking tour and a roundtable meeting this evening with Friends of Cedar Mesa Museum.\nWhile in Utah, the Secretary and other officials are holding daily press briefings on the ground. You can reach out to the Interior Department for more details.\nAnd with that, I'd be glad to take a few questions.\nKristen.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Former President Obama warned then President-elect Trump against hiring Mike Flynn as his national security advisor. Why did he ignore that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the President doesn't disclose details of meetings that he has, which, in this case, was an hour-long meeting. But it's true that the President made it -- President Obama made it known that he wasn't exactly a fan of General Flynn's, which is, frankly, shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obama's shortcomings, specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting ISIS and other threats around -- that were facing America.\nSo the question that you have to ask yourself really is, if President Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn why didn't he suspend General Flynn's security clearance, which they had just reapproved months earlier. Additionally, why did the Obama administration let Flynn go to Russia for a paid speaking engagement, which he did? There were steps that they could have taken -- if that was truly a concern, more than just a person that didn't -- had bad blood.\nQ: I want to follow up on a couple points, because you raised the security clearance. But before that, if a sitting President raises the name of one individual, why wouldn't that give the President-elect pause? I understand what you're saying, the caveat about the fact of the campaign, et cetera, but wouldn't that give the incoming President pause?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that -- I don't know that I agree with your characterization. He made it clear that he wasn't a fan of his, and I don't think that should have come as a surprise considering the role that General Flynn played in the campaign, criticizing his --\nQ: It didn't give him any pause at all?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think, again, I think if you know what we knew at the time, which is that the security clearance that he had had been reapproved in April of that year, and not only did they reapprove it, but then they took no steps to suspend it. So the question has to be what did they do if they had real concerns beyond just not having -- not liking him for some of the comments that he made.\nQ: And it's our understanding -- and if you could clarify this -- did Mike Flynn not need an upgraded security clearance in order to serve as the national security advisor?\nMR. SPICER: He'd been head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. That's the same --\nQ: And you vetted him, as well, correct?\nMR. SPICER: That's the same clearance that -- the security clearance -- we went over this a while ago -- it's the same clearance at any level. Once you get it, you get it for the time you had -- he had his reinvestigation in April of 2016, and the Obama administration took no steps -- not only did they reaffirm that security clearance, they took no steps to suspend it or take any other action.\nQ: But did you not vet him yourselves?\nMR. SPICER: Well, you don't vet -- on a security clearance, that's why you get a security clearance. Everyone in the government goes through the same process. So the answer is, is that those same -- that same process worked for General Flynn as it did for me, or for anyone else who works here. There's no difference of a security clearance once it's issued.\nZeke.\nQ: What we do know is what we knew at the time. So knowing what the White House knows now, does the White House, does the President think that General Flynn should not have had that clearance reissued last year, number one? And number two, does the White House believe that General Flynn was truthful when he filled out his SF-86 for that reinvestigation last year?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get into those details. Obviously, that was something that was adjudicated by the Obama administration in April of 2016. They took no steps to suspend that. So that's not really a question for us; it's a question for them at that time.\nQ: Knowing what you know now --\nMR. SPICER: I think the President took appropriate action when he did. Once he felt as though General Flynn had misled the Vice President, he took appropriate action at the time, and he stands by that today.\nQ: His ties to Russia, and his work as a registered foreign agent now -- registered foreign agent for the government of Turkey lead to his firing in February?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I don't think we're going to re-litigate this. The President made the right decision back then and he stands by that.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Last week, officials indicated that the Pentagon planned to send the President a proposal to send several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan. Can you confirm whether or not the President has made a decision about sending additional troops to Afghanistan? And if so, when are they going? How many are going? And what is their mission?\nMR. SPICER: I'll refer you to the Department of Defense on that. They are in contact with them. But we have nothing to share at this time.\nSara.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President tweeted this morning that senators on the Intelligence Committee should ask Sally Yates about her role in classified leaks about General Flynn. Does the President have evidence that ties Sally Yates to the Flynn leaks? Why did he tweet that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think you guys are well aware of the President's concern about spills of classified and other sensitive information out into the open. It's something that should concern every American. And the President has made it very clear since he took office that that's a big concern of his. And so the idea that classified information made its way into the press is something that I think, while we're asking all of these questions, is one of the ones that I think the senators should ask -- how did that information get out into the open like that. I think that is an equally important question that, frankly, isn't getting asked.\nQ: But does the President believe that Sally Yates was the leaker in this?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think the tweet speaks for itself. What he's saying is that the Senate should ask those questions.\nQ: Sean, aside from the announcement today that the President will nominate 10 judges to fill federal vacancies, many conservatives remain concerned the White House is woefully behind on overall appointments. The President recently told the Examiner -- to paraphrase him -- that he doesn't need to fill vacant posts in the administration. After these 10, there will still be 110 judicial vacancies. Does the President still believe vacant administration jobs do not need to be filled? And are there any plans to increase the pace of political appointments?\nMR. SPICER: So there's like three questions in there. I'll try to break them down. Number one, we have a very robust schedule of releasing names. There is a method to this in terms of the nominees who are getting put out now, and I think you should expect to see more and more go through. The process this time around is a little bit different. We're actually going through the Office of Government Ethics and FBI clearances before announcing most of these individuals. And so there's a little bit of a difference in how we're doing this. But we are well on pace with respect to many of these to get the government up and running.\nBut the President's point that he was making in that interview was that part of the review of government is to make sure that we're looking at these positions and figuring out whether or not the taxpayer is getting the best bang for their buck both in terms of productivity and cost. And so we're looking through the entire government -- Director Mulvaney I think briefed you all a while ago about how we look at government to figure out whether or not we can do a better job of filling positions, of staffing the government.\nBut we're going to continue to have announcements on key positions as this week goes by.\nQ: -- bureaucracy if you don't fill some of these --\nMR. SPICER: We are. And that's what I'm saying. I think that you're going to continue to see, whether it's judicial nominations, ambassadors, other key positions -- I think we have a very healthy clip of announcements that continue to go out.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Ahead of her testimony today, does President Trump believe Sally Yates is a trustworthy source of information?\nMR. SPICER: That's not up for us to decide. I mean, that is up to the Senate to decide whether or not what she does, and we'll have to wait and see what that --\nQ: And following up on Sara's question, it seemed that the President was implying that Sally Yates may have had something to do with the leaked information to newspapers. Is that what he was implying?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the tweet speaks for itself. Sometimes you don't have to read too much into it.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions on NAFTA. First, the Canadian Prime Minister, on Friday, said that they're considering, as a reaction to what the Prime Minister calls an unfair, punitive duty on Canadian software lumber -- considering banning coal imports from the U.S. Is this the beginning of a trade war between Canada and the U.S.?\nMR. SPICER: No. That's why we have dispute settlement mechanisms, to do this in a responsible way. Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary, has been in touch with his counterparts over there and I think -- look, there's a reason that the dispute mechanism is set up the way that it is under this particular trade agreement, but under most trade agreements, so that the two parties can resolve them in a way that allows for both sides to air their concerns. But that's why you have an agreement and that's why you have a mechanism set up to do that.\nQ: So you trust the mechanism on this?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, let's let it play out. But I think Secretary Ross took appropriate action to protect the U.S. industry, and we're going to let the process play out.\nQ: And 10 days ago, the President said that Mexico and Canada have agreed to fasten the process to renegotiate NAFTA. What has happened in the last 10 days?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I thin, our officials will start to -- we'll have further updates for you on that. Right now there is nothing to share.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. Did Sally Yates have to run any of her planned testimony by the General Counsel's office that she'll deliver later this afternoon?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of it, no.\nQ: And also, do you have any reason to doubt that her testimony, which will be under oath, will be truthful before the Senate Subcommittee?\nMR. SPICER: No. I would assume that when you raise your right hand and agree to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, that you'll do that. That's the whole reason that you pledge.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. For weeks during the transition, President Trump was not receiving a daily intelligence briefing; he was receiving his information from General Flynn. Do you think that lack of direct information from the intelligence community contributed to the lapse in vetting with General Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: So, first, he did get his -- we extensively went over the PDB briefing throughout the campaign. I believe back then it was three times a week that he was getting it, and, supplanted by his national security team, they would go in and do that. So I think the premise is not there.\nSecondly, as I mentioned to Kristen, the processes that were followed by General Flynn are followed by every government employee who receives a clearance at that particular level.\nQ: On another thing, I wanted to talk about the signing statement that came out on Friday with the spending bill. Senior administration officials, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, didn't seem to know about that. Why didn't she or people working on that issue know about that, know it was coming? Whose idea was that? And what happened between when Sarah was out here on Friday saying that she didn't think there was going to be something like that, and then close of business when there was a signing statement? And did you know it was coming?\nMR. SPICER: So signing statements are a pro forma activity that occurs during a bill signing that's performed by the Department of Justice Office of Legislative Counsel. It's been used by every President. So I'm not really sure what everyone knew, but that is something that goes along, going back multiple administrations.\nCecilia.\nQ: Can I follow with HBCUs, on that signing statement, please?\nMR. SPICER: Cecilia.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On the travel ban, a couple questions, if I may. Back in February, the President said that lifting the travel ban would mean that many bad and dangerous people would be pouring in. Have you seen any evidence that that's been the case in the three months since this ban was lifted?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's a question for the Department of Homeland Security.\nQ: Well, is that something you've been tracking?\nMR. SPICER: Personally, no, but I'd be glad to follow up with the Department of Homeland Security. I don't have anything at this time on that.\nQ: Okay. In the same vein, if this White House is no longer calling this a \"Muslim ban\" as the President did initially, why does the President's website still explicitly call for \"preventing Muslim immigration\"? And it says, \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of what's on the campaign website. You'd have to ask them. I know how we've talked about this from the first day of this administration -- as a travel a ban that's in this country's national security interest to make sure that the people who are coming in here are coming in here with the right motives. The reasons that we're having a public safety aspect to making sure that we're protecting our people - I think that's -- we've been very consistent since the first day of this administration on this.\nQ: Is it worth standing here, though, and completely disavowing the use of that phrase, \"Muslim ban\"? I mean, it's still on the website. If the President's words are being used against him in court today, is it worth you clarifying that once and for all?\nMR. SPICER: I'm trying to figure out why -- I've been very clear. I don't think I need to clarify what we have said or what the President said.\nQ: Well, it's stuff that's coming up in court. And that's expected to be --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And that's, frankly, one of the reasons that we have concerns about how that's being interpreted -- because I think the intent of the travel ban was very clear. I think it was something that the President made very clear in the filings that we have filed why he did it, the motives for doing it. And he was very clear when he spoke about it from the beginning.\nSo there really shouldn't be any question as to why the President is doing this, and the idea of making sure that we're putting the safety of our country and people first and foremost.\nTamara.\nQ: Thank you. I've got two topics, hopefully fast. So the Kushner family was in China making a pitch for the EB-5 visa program. This came a day after the President signed the omnibus, which of course extended that program without any changes. So two questions on that. One, is it a violation of the conflict of interest agreement that Jared Kushner came to? And also, does the President believe that that investor visa program needs to be modified in any way?\nMR. SPICER: So I think I would refer you to the company on that. Jared has done everything to comply with the ethics rules to make sure, and that had nothing to do with him, per se. He wasn't involved. And secondly -- I think we've talked about this before -- the President and Congress are looking at how to look over the entire visa program, all the various visa programs, and whether or not they are serving the purpose that they were intended to, whether or not we're making sure that we do what's in the best interest of the American worker. And so we're going to continue to work with Congress on that.\nQ: And regarding the opioid commission, it's my understanding that no members of that commission have been named yet. We're more than 30 days into what was supposed to be a 90-day period for that commission to come back with a report to the President. What's up with that? And does that send the wrong signal to people who believe that this is a very urgent crisis, where like more than 100 people are dying every day?\nMR. SPICER: Right. Well, let me get back to you on the exact names and the announcement on that. I've got to follow with that. I think when it comes to the opioid crisis, the President, both during the campaign, the transition, and now as President, has made it very clear of his commitment to figuring out how we can address this crisis that plagues so many neighborhoods and communities. And he'll continue to work with -- you know, he appointed Governor Christie in a bipartisan commission. So as soon as w\nQ: Sean, can I ask you about the presidential nominees really quickly?\nMR. SPICER: Kevin.\nQ: Why is it important for the President to get these 10 individuals out there to serve the country? And on a more broad perspective of this question, there are a number of vacancies -- 129 -- going into today, to say nothing of some of the openings over there in the EEOB that I'm sure could still be filled. The pace seems slow. Is the President aware of that pace? Is he comfortable with the pace? And what's the White House doing, not just to fill those important judicial jobs, but others that are related to the administration?\nMR. SPICER: So on the judicial jobs, obviously we're going through it in a very methodical way. As I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of background that goes on in each of these in terms of the Office of Government Ethics, the FBI background check that goes on. And so they're all in pipeline. I think you'll continue to see a very robust amount of announcements on not just the judicial front but on several of the fronts.\nAnd we're really -- we've been tracking where we are. I think we're well on pace with where previous administrations have been -- some ahead, some a little behind -- but we're doing a great job of filling those key positions and making sure that we get the right person for the right job.\nQ: I want to ask you a big-picture question about Afghanistan. You were asked about troop levels and don't have an answer to that, but last week the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction painted a very grim picture. Security incidents through March reached the highest level in a decade. Civilian casualties were the highest on record. There's rampant drug use in Afghanistan. So as the President weighs this request for more troops, what's going to be his ultimate goal? Is it going to be stability? Is it outright victory in the 16th, 17th year of this war?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think number one, he wants to make sure that we defeat ISIS -- that is something that is in our national security interests -- and to make sure that we protect our people, but does so in a responsible, smart way. I mean, he's talked about not projecting where he's going and what he's going to do to let the enemy know ahead of time, and part of that guidance that his national security team is giving him are different pieces that you're talking about. How do we achieve those key outcomes? How do we do what's in the country's best interest and utilize our military and our treasure to the best of our ability? That is something that we're continuing to work on and do, and that's part of what he is getting briefed on and is implementing.\nSo I'm not entirely sure that answers where you're going, but that is what he has been getting briefed on, and that is the kind of decision-making process that is currently underway.\nQ: Is the President displeased with the current state of affairs in Afghanistan?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think he wants to make sure that we do what we can to win. And that's why he charged the generals and other military advisors and national security team to come up with a plan that can get us there.\nRonica.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Does the President believe that healthcare is a right or a product?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President has been very clear in his statements that, whether or not you call it a right or not, he wants every person to have access to healthcare that covers preexisting conditions, that is affordable. And I think the steps that he's taken over the last week, and the bill that he worked to pass through the House clearly highlight those priorities.\nHe wants to make sure that people have access to care. He is concerned when he hears about companies leaving the marketplace and not giving consumers a choice. He is concerned when he hears about deductibles going through the roof, costs going through the roof, and people not having the access that they can to healthcare. And he is very concerned that we are facing a choice right now where Obamacare is failing and dying, and that if we don't act, that people won't have access to healthcare and they won't be able to afford it. And so the steps that he is taking are to achieve those principles that he has laid out.\nBlake.\nQ: Two questions as it relates to President Trump and former President Obama. Back to that November conversation, were there specific reasons given, as it relates to Michael Flynn? And if so, was that based on private information?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that. I know that, like I said, he passed along exactly what I mentioned to Kristen at the outset.\nMichael.\nQ: Two clarifications. On the signing statement, broadly, not just the subject of HBCUs, are you saying that the President was not aware of the details of that very long signing statement, and it was just something done at --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. That's not -- I'm sorry. No, the President is obviously aware of what happened. The question was asked is -- it is a process. It has happened for administrations going back generations, I'm sure. I don't have the precise nature of when signing statements came into being. But this is a normal pro forma piece that goes along with a bill signing to make sure that the executive branch's intent is as understood.\nQ: But a lot of the things that were in that signing statement were things that were essentially carryovers from things that Obama had also objected to. But the President and the senior staff here was aware of what those things were and approved those being --\nMR. SPICER: Of course, yes.\nQ: Okay. Second question, on Flynn and the security clearance. You guy have made, both from the podium here and also the President made a big deal of this question of the Obama people gave him the clearance or re-upped the clearance earlier. Are you suggesting now, knowing what you guys know with hindsight and whatever, are you saying that they should have -- you believe that the Obama administration should have denied him his clearance back in April based on the information that you're now aware of -- connections with Russia, et cetera, et cetera? Are you suggesting that they should have denied it?\nMR. SPICER: No. What I'm suggesting is, is that you can't have it both ways. That the folks who are coming out and saying Obama expressed some concern about Flynn -- well, number one, it was pretty expected. This is a guy who was very outspoken in his criticism of President Obama's policies. So the idea that President Obama didn't like the guy doesn't seem shocking.\nBut the point that you have to ask yourself is, if the Obama administration, or under the Obama administration, if they reissued one of the highest security clearances that you can get -- knowing what they knew then -- and then didn't do anything to take a proactive step to suspend it in any way, shape, or form, the question you have to ask yourself is, if they were concerned, why didn't they take any steps? They're the ones who had, at that point, all the access and all the knowledge to everything that was on his SF-86 security clearance -- not us.\nSo if President Obama or anyone else, frankly, in the government was concerned, the question should be asked, what did they do? And if nothing, then why not, if they really truly were concerned? I think that is a fair question.\nDave.\nQ: Sean, over the weekend, North Korea detained a fourth U.S. citizen. Are you concerned that they're trying to escalate tensions even further? Do you consider these Americans hostages? And what are you doing diplomatically, back-channel or otherwise, to try and get them released?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, obviously this is concerning. We're well aware of it and we're going to work through the embassy of Sweden that has a facility in North Korea -- or an embassy in North Korea -- through our State Department to seek the release of the individuals there. But I would refer you to the State Department on that.\nQ: Sean, thanks very much. Just to follow up on your answer on Afghanistan, you mentioned ISIS but you didn't mention the Taliban. Should we read that to mean that the focus will be on ISIS?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's to defeat both the ISIS and Taliban. I mean, there's no -- it's to make sure that we put our national security interests first, and defeat all of those folks that seek to do us harm.\nQ: Are you willing to negotiate with the Taliban?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think right now the whole point of this is the President is receiving a plan and guidance from his national security team as he had asked for. That guidance is coming forward as we speak. He's continued to meet with them, and there will be further updates from the Department of Defense as we move forward.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, the Vice President has an event. I want to make sure the pool has time to set for it. We're around all afternoon. Take care. Thank you.\nEND 1:42 P.M.

You all got your picture with him. You know who this is, don't you? Whisper it. Whisper it.\nSo this is Marlon Bundo, and Marlon has his own Instagram account -- @marlonbundo. (Laughter.) And he is -- he's what we call BOTUS -- okay, so he is the Bunny of the United States. (Laughter.) So he is BOTUS.\nSo Marlon is kind of famous because he is the first bunny to ever ride on Air Force Two. (Laughter.) And we love Marlon. He's named Marlon Bundo because he's named after a famous movie star, Marlon Brando and because my daughter got him when she was making a movie in college, and she needed a bunny to be the star. So Marlon -- this notoriety is nothing new for him. (Laughter.) But he's a very tame bunny. He runs around our house all the time, jumps in the cage when he needs to. But he's very, very tame.\nAnd I just want to thank all these amazing children. Marlon came today really just to say hi to you, and to say thank you to all the children. And you guys were so nice.\nDon't clap. (Laughter.) He'll jump. But you all were so nice to be so gentle with him.\nBut you know what, I really wasn't brought out here to introduce Marlon Bundo. I was brought out here to introduce the Vice President of the United States. (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: How about a quiet round of applause for Mrs. Pence and Marlon Bundo? (Applause.)\n(The bunny is admired.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mrs. Pence. And thank you all for being here today. On behalf of the First Family, on behalf of Ivanka Trump and her wonderful children and her husband, and General McMaster, and on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, welcome to the White House. (Applause.)\nI'm just so excited to be with all of you, and Karen and I were so thrilled to be with all of you because we have the great privilege of having a son and a daughter-in-law who are serving our country. Our son is in the United States Marine Corps.\nI love these kids. (Laughter.)\nSo we appreciate the sacrifices. We appreciate the sacrifices that our military families make, and it is, in fact, this week is -- we're going to have a special celebration this week to celebrate our military families. But the month of May is National Military Appreciation Month. And on behalf of our Commander-in-Chief, the President of the United States of America, I bring you thanks and I bring you greetings. I truly do.\nThe President asked Karen and I to host this event today just as a way of saying thanks, paying a debt of gratitude to the families and the servicemen and women who are gathered here today who serve our country each and every day.\nGeneral McMaster said it so well just a few short moments ago. We honor your families because your families protect us. And while we're at it -- and while we're at it -- why don't we give a round of applause to all the servicemen and women who are with us here today who are wearing the uniform of the United States? (Applause.)\nBut today is really about celebrating that while servicemembers enlist, it's families that serve. And I want to give a rousing round of applause to the military spouses who are with us here today who keep the home fires burning and who support their spouses as they serve our country. (Applause.)\nAnd all of these wonderful and energetic children -- (laughter) -- who are with us today, some of whom themselves may follow your parents in the uniform of the United States, we're just truly honored to have you here today.\nThis coming Friday will be Military Spouse Appreciation Day.\nPresident Ronald Reagan instituted this celebration in 19-and-84 to recognize the crucial role that spouses play in the lives of our armed forces. And President Donald Trump is proud to continue this tradition here in this first year of our administration.\nOn the President's behalf, I just want to thank our military spouses. I want to thank you for not only the families that you build and that you serve, but for the difference that you make on and off-base with all of the families who serve and all those who provide support roles.\nI want to recognize just a few people in particular who are here. We're especially honored to be joined today by those from every branch of the service who've actually been named Military Spouse of the Year. We have three national award winners, eight service branch winners, eight base winners. Would you join me in congratulating the Military Spouses of the Year who are with us here today? (Applause.)\nI'd particularly like to recognize Mrs. Deborah Mullen and the members of the Tragedy Assistance Program of Survivors who are with us here today. Deborah Mullen has dedicated a life of service, along with her husband. And where is Deborah at? Is she in the room? Maybe in the back of the room. Give Deborah a big round of applause. She makes an incredible difference. (Applause.)\nAnd lastly, Ivanka Trump just said it so well. On behalf of the President of the United States and his family and our family, I want to recognize our Gold Star Families who are here with us here today. (Applause.) You honor us by your presence and I promise you, on behalf of the President of the United States, the American people will never forget your loved one or the sacrifice your family made for our freedom. So help us God. Let's hear it for our Gold Star Families, would you please?

And I'm proud to say the President actually submitted a budget that will have the largest increase in military spending since the days of President Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nThe President is absolutely committed and our entire administration will continue to work every day to rebuild our military, to restore the arsenal of democracy, but most important of all to give your families and your loved one the resources they need and deserve, the training they need and deserve to accomplish their mission and come home safe.\nThat's our pledge to each and every one of you, and it's a solemn pledge and a solemn oath.\nThe Old Book says: If you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect.\nOn behalf of the President of the United States of America, I hope you see this crowded room as just one more down payment on a debt of honor and a debt of gratitude that we owe to the families of our armed forces.\nWe're grateful that you're here at the White House today. We hope you leave here today with your hearts full of the assurance that the American people are grateful for those who serve in uniform and just as grateful for the families who stand by their side.\nThank you all very much.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124252", "text": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\nFROM: ROD J. ROSENSTEIN\nDEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\nSUBJECT: RESTORING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has long been regarded as our nation's premier federal investigative agency. Over the past year, however, the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many Department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.\nThe current FBI Director is an articulate and persuasive speaker about leadership and the immutable principles of the Department of Justice. He deserves our appreciation for his public service. As you and I have discussed, however, I cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.\nThe Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement. At most, the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors. The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict. But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. On July 5, however, the Director announced his own conclusions about the nation's most sensitive criminal investigation, without the authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders.\nCompounding the error, the Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation. Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.\nIn response to skeptical questions at a congressional hearing, the Director defended his remarks by saying that his \"goal was to say what is true. What did we do, what did we find, what do we think about it.\" But the goal of a federal criminal investigation is not to announce our thoughts at a press conference. The goal is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a federal criminal prosecution, then allow a federal prosecutor who exercises authority delegated by the Attorney General to make a prosecutorial decision, and then - if prosecution is warranted - let the judge and jury determine the facts. We sometimes release information about closed investigations in appropriate ways, but the FBI does not do it sua sponte.\nConcerning his letter to the Congress on October 28, 2016, the Director cast his decision as a choice between whether he would \"speak\" about the FBI's decision to investigate the newly- discovered email messages or \"conceal\" it. \"Conceal\" is a loaded term that misstates the issue. When federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing nonpublic information. In that context, silence is not concealment.\nMy perspective on these issues is shared by former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from different eras and both political parties. Judge Laurence Silberman, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Ford, wrote that \"it is not the bureau's responsibility to opine on whether a matter should be prosecuted.\" Silberman believes that the Director's \"performance was so inappropriate for an FBI director that [he] doubt[s] the bureau will ever completely recover.\" Jamie Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton, joined with Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush, to opine that the Director had \"chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness, departing from the department's traditions.\" They concluded that the Director violated his obligation to \"preserve, protect and defend\" the traditions of the Department and the FBI.\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, observed that the Director \"stepped way outside his job in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion\" because the FBI director \"doesn't make that decision.\" Alberto Gonzales, who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush, called the decision \"an error in judgment.\" Eric Holder, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama, said that the Director's decision \"was incorrect. It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions. And it ran counter to guidance that I put in place four years ago laying out the proper way to conduct investigations during an election season.\" Holder concluded that the Director \"broke with these fundamental principles\" and \"negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI.\"\nFormer Deputy Attorneys General Gorelick and Thompson described the unusual events as \"real-time, raw-take transparency taken to its illogical limit, a kind of reality TV of federal criminal investigation,\" that is \"antithetical to the interests of justice.\"\nDonald Ayer, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, along with other former Justice Department officials, was \"astonished and perplexed\" by the decision to \"break[] with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections.\" Ayer's letter noted, \"Perhaps most troubling ... is the precedent set by this departure from the Department's widely-respected, non-partisan traditions.\"\nWe should reject the departure and return to the traditions.\nAlthough the President has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former Department officials. The way the Director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.", "timestamp": "2017-05-09", "title": "Memorandum for the Attorney General from Rod J.

SPICER: Sorry I'm late, wrapping up some business. Good afternoon. The President this morning met with General McMaster. As you know, General McMaster is helping lead the team that's organizing the President's upcoming foreign trip, and this week the President has been focused on meeting with the team, getting ready for the various stops that he'll be making and meetings that he's going to be having.\nDuring his many conversations with world leaders, the President has seen a great desire for America to reengage and be a leader once again in helping solve the world's complex problems. And he's already made moves, both behind the scenes with leaders and in his public statements, to show them that America is reasserting its leadership on the world stage.\nThese visits are another important part of this American resurgence. While on the trip, the President will further our strategic objectives in the region, creating new opportunities that will strengthen the United States and our allies while weakening our enemies. I know many of you are interested in the logistical aspects of this trip, and we'll be trying to have further briefings throughout the week on those aspects of the trip as soon as we can, so stay tuned.\nAlso on the subject of foreign visits, I'd like to announce that the President has invited the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates to visit the White House on May 15th, and the Crown Prince has accepted. We look forward to welcoming the Crown Prince and see the visit as an opportunity to deepen cooperation with a key partner in the Middle East.\nMoving on to domestic matters, the Vice President spent his morning today on Capitol Hill. He met privately with Majority Leader McConnell and also had individual meetings with other senators. The discussions focused primarily on the path forward for the American Health Care Act in the Senate, and how the administration can work with Congress to craft a tax reform bill that follows the President's priorities -- simplification, providing tax relief to the American families and individuals, and stimulating the economy.\nThe Vice President also attended the weekly Senate Republican policy lunch. Later this afternoon, the Vice President will be joined by Second Lady Karen Pence, General McMaster, and Ivanka Trump to welcome more than 150 military families of all branches of service for a reception at the White House. The event recognizes National Military Appreciation Month and National Military Spouse Appreciation Day, which takes place this Friday.\nThe President's Cabinet is busy inside and out of the beltway speaking on the administration's agenda with local officials and key stakeholders. Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price is in Michigan and West Virginia today, where he will hear from those on the front lines of the fight against the opioid epidemic.\nAlso today, the Justice Department announced that the Attorney General will be speaking on opioids on Thursday at a Drug Enforcement Administration 360 Heroin and Opioid Response Summit in Charleston, South Carolina. The DEA's 360 strategy is designed to help cities and surrounding regions deal with the heroin and prescription drug abuse epidemic and the violent crime associated with it. This day-long event, sponsored by the DEA, Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and the University of Charleston School of Pharmacy, will bring together stakeholders and professionals working in law enforcement, prevention, education, treatment, recovery, healthcare, and emergency response.\nIn Washington, Secretary of Commerce Ross is speaking this afternoon at the 47th Conference of the Americas, which is taking place at the State Department. The event brings together administration officials, distinguished leaders from across the region to focus on major policy issues affecting the hemisphere. Also at the State Department this morning, Secretary Tillerson participated in a signing ceremony for the United States-Georgia General Security of Information Agreement with the Prime Minister of Georgia, a major milestone in security cooperation between our two countries.\nThe President was also pleased to see several top administration officials recently move through the Senate. Last night, Heather Wilson was confirmed to be Secretary of the Air Force, and Governor Branstad was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be ambassador to China and is moving on for a vote on the floor of the Senate. The President also looks forward to seeing Dr. Scott Gottlieb serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration later today.\nFinally, with regard to the Paris Climate Agreement, the President has been meeting with his team for quite a while on this matter, and he will not be making an announcement regarding that agreement until after he returns from the G7.\nWith that, I'd be glad to take your questions.\nKaitlyn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I've got two questions for you today. First one is, why did the President wait 18 days to fire Mike Flynn after the White House was informed of his conduct and warned that he was a potential target for Russian blackmail? Because you realize, the timing of this makes a lot of people think that he wouldn't have been fired if the story had not come out in the media.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think, first of all, let's look at the timeline. Sally Yates came here on the 26th of January. Then she informed the Counsel's Office that there were materials that were relevant to the situation. It wasn't until about seven days later that they had access to those documents. After that time, they did what you should do, frankly, it's an element of due process, reviewing the situation. They informed the President right away after they were informed of her giving us a head's up. And ultimately, the President made the right decision.\nBut I guess the question -- or the point that I would put back on you is, somebody came over, gave us a head's up on a situation, told us there were materials. We were provided those materials seven days later, reviewed those materials, underwent a process of reviewing the situation, and ultimately the President made a decision and it was the right one.\nSo I think that the process worked, frankly, when you think of the time in which we had the information to make the decision that the President made.\nQ: Well, you're saying the President stands by that decision, he made the right decision, but why does he continue to defend Mike Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't think -- it's not a question of defending Mike Flynn or not.\nQ: He was defending him. He said it was a \"witch hunt\" and he \"should seek immunity.\"\nMR. SPICER: Right. I think Mike Flynn is somebody who honorably served our country in uniform for over 30 years. And I think, as he's noted, Lieutenant General Flynn was asked for his resignation because he misled the Vice President.\nBut beyond that, I think he did have an honorable career. He served with distinction in uniform for over 30 years. And the President does not want to smear a good man.\nQ: What was his role at the White House in those 18 days? Was he still fulfilling his role and National Security Advisor duties?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I'm not going to get back into it. I will say, as I mentioned, the time --\nQ: But don't you think it's worrisome that he was still doing that when he was a potential target of Russian blackmail?\nMR. SPICER: Can I just -- one thing that I think is important to note is, let's look at, again how this came down. Someone who is not exactly a supporter of the President's agenda who, a couple days after this first conversation took place, refused to uphold a lawful order of the President's who is not exactly someone that was excited about President Trump taking office or his agenda -- she had been --\nQ: So you think that affected her decision on Mike Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on -- Kaitlyn, hold on, no -- Kaitlyn, let me answer the question. She had come here, given a head's up, told us there were materials. And at the same time, we did what we should do. Just because someone comes in and gives you a head's up about something and says, I want to share some information, doesn't mean that you immediately jump the gun and go take an action.\nI think if you flip this scenario and say, what if we had just dismissed somebody because a political opponent of the President had made an utterance, you would argue that it was pretty irrational to act from that manner. We did what we were supposed to do. The President made, ultimately, the right decision. And I think he was proven -- that --\nQ: How is she a political opponent of the President? She was acting attorney general that he --\nMR. SPICER: Appointed by the Obama administration and a strong supporter of Clinton. So that's now, I think, number four.\nJim.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Are the cancelled meetings a sign the President is vacillating on the Paris accord and undecided whether to remain in the agreement or withdraw from it?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's simply a sign that the President wants to continue to meet with his team, develop a -- meet with not just the national -- the economic piece, but his environmental team and come to a decision on what's the best interest of the United States using the expertise that surrounds him.\nQ: Sean, does the President want a win the war in Afghanistan?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: What would winning mean to him?\nMR. SPICER: I think reducing the threat, especially when it comes to ISIS and the Taliban.\nQ: Reducing the threat?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, minimizing, eliminating. But obviously, in the best case scenario we want --\nQ: You do realize there's a difference.\nMR. SPICER: Major, I'm going to answer Mara's question. I think the answer is, is that we want to eliminate the threats that are against our national security and pose a threat to our citizens, our allies. So we need to fully eliminate any threat around the globe, frankly, not just in Afghanistan, that poses a threat to our people and our allies.\nQ: I just have a question as he considers what to do next and if he wants to commit more troops. At one point we had 100,000 troops there and we didn't eliminate the threat. Why would 15,000 do the trick if 100,000 didn't before?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that's a very Washington question, meaning just because you spend more, throw more people, doesn't mean you're doing it in the most effective way. I think one of the things that he has asked his national security team to do is to actually think the -- rethink the strategy. What are we doing to achieve the goals that you are asking about, how do we actually -- how do we win? How do we eliminate the threat?\nAnd I think doing that isn't just a question of throwing money or people, but looking at the mission and the strategy. And that's what the team has been doing holistically, not just in Afghanistan, but the total -- beyond Afghanistan it's also the way that he's asking them to look at the threat that ISIS poses.\nQ: And when he makes his final decision will he explain this to the American people, or will it be just something coming out --\nMR. SPICER: We'll see. I mean, I don't want to get in front of -- I don't know how he's going to do that, but we'll wait and see and go from there.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. A question about the President's policy concerning Syria. This morning we learned from the Pentagon that the President has approved the plan to directly arm Syrian Kurds against ISIS. Has the President discussed this plan with the leader of Turkey? And what was the reaction from Turkey?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know if he's addressed this to the President yet. I do know that yesterday the President authorized the Department of Defense to equip Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces as necessary to ensure a clear victory over ISIS in Raqqa, Syria. The SDF, partnered with enabling support from U.S. and coalition forces, are the only force on the ground that can successfully seize Raqqa in the near future. We're keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partners in Turkey. We want to reassure the people and the government of Turkey that the U.S. is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally.\nThe U.S. continues to prioritize support for Arab elements of the SDF. Raqqa and all liberated territories should return to the governance of local Syrian Arabs. The fight for Raqqa will be long and difficult, but ultimately yet another defeat for ISIS and another step towards eliminating the ISIS threat that threatens peace and security in the region and the world.\nQ: The Secretary of State is meeting today with his counterpart from Russia today, the Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov. Are you expecting any deliverables from that particular meeting?\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll have a readout when that's done.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I've got two for you. First, do you expect the Afghan review and the ISIS review to be done by the time the President heads to Saudi Arabia?\nMR. SPICER: I don't want to -- that's a question that I'm going to leave up to the national security team. I'm not going to -- the President is not putting a deadline on that. We're making sure that he -- this is obviously -- what we announced today is part of that. It is not entirely it, and we will have more as we go forward. I just don't want to pin down a timeline on that.\nQ: One more. In this briefing you've talked about the President's desire to \"fully eliminate any threat around the globe to U.S. interests.\" You've talked about the United States wanting to \"reengage and be a leader once again,\" and \"reasserting its leadership on the world stage.\" Some of the President's supporters are going to hear in those comments maybe a bad omen about the President changing his mind and becoming more interventionist. Not saying he wasn't going to be an interventionist, because he talked about ISIS a fair amount, but what would you tell them about, uh oh, is he going to embark now on nation-building, is he going to deepen American involvement in conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan and elsewhere?\nMR. SPICER: No. I appreciate that. I think that his priorities remain the same, but he's going to do what he can to make sure that he protects the country and our people -- and threats that directly affect the United States.\nQ: Just following up, and correct me if I'm wrong -- I know you will -- but the day after it was announced that he was under investigation, Flynn, he met with, if I'm correct, with Pence and the Russians on a phone call. So while he's under investigation, why is he being allowed to participate as the national security advisor?\nMR. SPICER: I really don't recall the schedule from that day, Brian. But the point is, again, I think this is -- look, I answered the question a moment ago. But I think -- as I went through the timeline, Sally Yates came over here, gave us a head's up, provided us the opportunity to -- made it very clear the materials were available for the Counsel to review, but -- and we followed that process. And within 11 days after that, we accepted General Flynn's resignation that the President had asked for.\nQ: But the point being, while he's under investigation, what is --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. But, look, we're not going to re-litigate the past on this. I think we've been very clear as to what happened and why it happened. I think the President made the right decision and we've moved on.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Can you confirm that the meeting today between Ivanka Trump and Mr. Pruitt cancelled, and if so, why?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I'd be glad to get back to you on that. I'm not sure.\nQ: And secondly, as it relates to the G7, you said the decision on the Paris Climate Agreement will be made after the G7. So does the President feel that he can extract any concessions while he's there? Does he feel like he can renegotiate it? Or does he just want more time? Why until after the G7?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President wants to make sure that he has an opportunity to continue to meet with his team to create the best strategy for this country going forward.\nSara Murry, welcome back. Mrs. --\nQ: Just Mrs. Sara Murray.\nMR. SPICER: Just Mrs. Sara Murray. Congratulations.\nQ: Thank you very much. I just want to get back to Olivier's point. Why shouldn't President Trump supporters, if he does decide to add more troops in Afghanistan, see that as running counter to what he campaigned on for so long, the notion of America first, the notion of -- the fact that we're too involved in foreign entanglements abroad? He campaigned on that, and the way he's governed, I think from what we've seen in Syria and Afghanistan, he's sent a very different message.\nMR. SPICER: I just want to be clear -- the one thing that -- there is a difference between Afghanistan proper and our effort to defeat ISIS. And that's one thing that he was also very clear on in the campaign, that -- and as President that he is going to do everything he can to fight radical Islamic terrorism, to root out and destroy ISIS.\nIn some cases, if ISIS -- where he has to go into Afghanistan, that's -- they may be synonymous at that point. But they are not always the same, right? You can be in -- the goal is always going to be defeat ISIS, which is something that he's been very clear on with the American people from the get go.\nBut that all being said, let's be clear, with the exception of the piece that we announced today, that the President authorized yesterday, no decision has been made. So let's not get ahead of what that ultimate policy will be.\nQ: One other question. Can you just give us a better sense of what the President has been doing with his time the last few days? We haven't had very detailed schedules, we haven't been seeing him publicly. He's only had one or two meetings. So what is he actually doing all day long?\nMR. SPICER: Thanks. I mean, as I said at the top, the President is going on a nine-day -- eight-day trip. He's going to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome, the G7, NATO. This is an opportunity next week, as I mentioned -- he's going to have the Crown Prince here, he's got a commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy.\nPart of the use of this week is to be meeting with the principals the head of -- the directorates of the countries that we're going to ahead of the meetings where he's -- receiving extensive briefings throughout the week with his team. He's had several meeting with General McMaster over the last couple weeks. He was one of the leaders in the effort for this trip. He's met with the chief of staff, his legislative team. He was just meeting when I walked out of the Oval Office with the -- part of his economic team.\nSo this is an opportunity for him to get ahead of this first really long foreign trip to make sure that he is, on a whole host of issues -- whether it's ISIS, whether it's our economic issues or trade issues -- to make sure that go in there, strengthen our relationships, but also make sure that we put America's priorities first.\nQ: President Trump tweeted yesterday that the story of possible collusion between his campaign and Russia is a hoax, and he questioned whether this \"taxpayer funded charade\" would end. Is the administration trying to set parameters on what Congress and the FBI should investigate?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And if that is the case -- so what was -- what did the President mean by \"when will this [taxpayer funded] charade end\"?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- even Director Clapper said yesterday when asked if there was any evidence that he had seen of collusion, he said no. And I think that at some point -- I said it before in this briefing room -- but we have to take no for an answer. He said that -- the Director of National Intelligence asked, has there been anything that you've seen additionally that shows collusion. He answered very clearly -- the answer is no. And it continues to be no. And I think that there is a point at which all of the things that the President is doing economically and national security-wise to move the country forward is this needs to -- we need to take no for an answer and move on to the issues.\nQ: But is it the role of Congress and the FBI to say when a matter should be concluded and not the White House?\nAnd then also, following up on that, Senator Lindsey Graham has said that he wants to look into President Trump's business dealings to see if there are any connections to Russia. Would the White House cooperate with that?\nMR. SPICER: So the President obviously was aware of Senator Graham's suggestion after he made it, and he's fine with that. He has no business in Russia. He has no connections to Russia, so he welcomes that. In fact, he has already charged a leading law firm in Washington, D.C. to send a certified letter to Senator Graham to that point, that he has no connections to Russia. So that should be a really easy look.\nMatt.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions on two different topics. First, you said that Sally Yates was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton. What is that based on?\nMR. SPICER: I think she's made -- I think she -- it was widely rumored to play a large role in the Justice Department if Hillary Clinton had won.\nQ: So on a different topic, I have a question about that fired usher Angella Reid. It was reported that she received a generous severance package. I'm wondering how do you give a substantial severance package to a government employee?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I'd be glad to get back you on that.\nAnita.\nQ: Yesterday, we learned that -- or Sally Yates had said that she learned of the first immigration order, the travel ban by reading the newspaper. And I'm wondering why the Acting Attorney General wasn't privy to that? Was that because she was a Clinton-Obama -- Obama appointee, Clinton supporter? Why was the Acting Attorney General not notified? She had just met that same day that he signed the document, so he could have mentioned, it as well.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know why she wasn't. Again, I think if we want to re-litigate the first executive order at the time, we talked about all of the proper individuals that needed to be made aware of were made aware of at the time.\nQ: Is it not unusual that the Attorney General --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I -- also just to be clear, again, remember this is someone who ultimately didn't even want to enforce it. So to suggest that somehow --\nQ: She wanted to enforce it until she knew about it --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But I think ultimately we were proven right about who needed to be in the loop on that because she ultimately chose to disregard the President's lawful order.\nQ: It was on purpose, though, is what --\nMR. SPICER: No, I didn't say that. Please don't put -- I did not say that. What I'm saying is that we discussed at the time of the executive order being signed back in January the process by which that was followed. The appropriate people then were in the loop on that.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Yesterday in her testimony, Sally Yates said that she arranged for White House Counsel to view the evidence against General Flynn at the DOJ, but she wasn't around to see if that happened. You said that that took place seven days after her initial meeting. Was the evidence against Flynn relayed to the President at that time, or did the President learn about the allegations against Flynn through the media 18 days later?\nMR. SPICER: So following the meeting, the White House Counsel immediately informed the President and senior White House personnel when she first came here. Late on Friday, the 27th, Yates and the White House Counsel met again to discuss certain issues that she had left unclear at the time. And then those -- the President, as you know, fired her on the 30th of January after she refused to enforce the President's legal executive order. Contrary to the advice of career DOJ officials at the time, who had given -- told her that this was legal, she overrode them, didn't do this.\nThe White House didn't get access to that underlying evidence described by Ms. Yates until Thursday, February 2nd, which is a week after Ms. Yates first met with the White House Counsel. And then that's when I think the full sort of review began once they had access to that information.\nQ: Was the President informed at that time?\nMR. SPICER: I know he was informed at the front end of what she had told him, and the Counsel had informed them that they were going to then seek the information that she said was available to them.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, two different topics for you. I want to follow up on what a couple of folks have already mentioned here. You've described in this briefing what Sally Yates did as a heads-up with Don McGahn. She has testified she came to the White House twice, in-person, to meet with Don McGahn, on the 26th and the 27th, to do more, she says, than simply offer to provide materials. She said she encouraged the White House to act and expressed real concern about Mike Flynn being compromised by the Russians. On the 28th, Saturday, Mike Flynn sat in on that Oval Office phone call with President Putin. Was that the right call?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think what you have is somebody who was an Obama appointee coming in and saying, I'm giving -- I get it, but --\nQ: Was that the right call?\nMR. SPICER: But at that moment, sure. You have someone who you have to wonder whether -- why they're telling you something to the point where they had to come back a second time because what they were saying was unclear.\nQ: So let me raise a second topic. You said it was widely rumored that she wanted to be a part of the Clinton White House potentially, and so that makes you negate her coming to --\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not -- again -- I guess my point is that somebody who is not -- who clearly showed by the fact that career DOJ attorneys told her that the President's lawful order\n-- that she should sign the President's lawful order, and then chose not to do it was --\nQ: After --\nMR. SPICER: I get it, but that vindicates the President's point that this was not somebody who was looking out -- I think my point is, is that we were correct in the assumptions that we made at the time.\nQ: You stand by -- and my second topic for you, though, is just on healthcare.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Is the White House asking Senate leadership to put more women on the working group?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of that.\nQ: Would the White House like to see that?\nMR. SPICER: I think the more voices that we can put on a panel to help get this done, the better. So to the extent -- I'm not going to tell Leader McConnell -- or the White House is not going to tell him how to conduct a panel, but at the same time, I think that any voices that can be constructive in getting a patient-centric healthcare system put together would be welcome. But that's not our call to make.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There's been a number of conversations in Washington this week about the relationship between H.R. McMaster and the President. How does President Trump characterize his relationship with his National Security Advisor?\nMR. SPICER: Excellent.\nQ: Another follow-up question very quickly on Flynn. You've spoken from the podium before about the President asking Michael Flynn to resign as a result of him misleading the Vice President. We've learned a lot about Michael Flynn this week, a potential investigation, and we know of actual investigations into his actions before coming here to the White House. Was this at all considered in the President's decision to ask him to resign?\nMR. SPICER: I think you can only -- you can only accept someone's resignation once. So he asked for it, he got it. And so to go back and re-litigate isn't really something that makes a ton of sense. He got it. He asked for it. He got it the first time. I don't think you go back and continue to say would I have asked for it here, here, and here. He did what he did the first time. He was right, and he got.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Can you just be clear on the 18 days? Did the White House put any security restrictions on Mike Flynn at all during that period of time? Was he limited in terms of his access to classified information, national secrets, or decision-making in any way?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of any.\nQ: Was that a mistake in retrospect?\nMR. SPICER: It doesn't -- the decision that we made was the right one. The President made a decision. He stands by it.\nJenna.\nQ: So I just want to go over this timeline again. You have Yates coming to the White House on January 26th and the 27th. You then have McGahn going to the DOJ on February 2nd to see those documents. But it's not until February 13th that Flynn actually resigns. Tell us what happened between -- you got this warning. You then saw documents that backed up that warning, and then you have 11 days that pass. What was happening in those 11 days?\nMR. SPICER: I think if you go back in time and look at what we talked about at the time, there were several conversations that occurred with General Flynn between the Chief of Staff, the General Counsel, the Vice President -- that all occurred then.\nLook, we took -- when you think about the scope of time that actually occurred, those 11 days, to make sure that we did the right thing is important. And we ultimately did. And that's what's important when you think of this. And when you look at this compared to other instances, the idea that in 11 days a review was conducted, the President acted decisively, I think that's actually -- shows that the system worked properly.\nQ: Are you guys disputing at all how Yates describes those conversations on the 26th and 27th? She's saying that she came here with great urgency, that she made clear that he had been compromised, that she had evidence that he had been compromised, that this was something that she felt like the White House was going to take action on.\nMR. SPICER: Look, I'm not going to -- I don't think that there's 100 percent agreement about how she describes everything. But I think generally as far as the timeline goes, we're fine with it. But again, I'm not going to nitpick the fact that her -- what her tone was like. I would suggest that the reason that she was asked to come back the second day was because it wasn't\n-- it clearly wasn't that clear on the first day.\nSo if it -- I think logic dictates you don't ask someone to come back and explain themselves a second time if they have done an effective job the first time. But, again, I'm not going to get into needling every little point about what happened.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions on --\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: -- diverse areas. First, the citizens group known as United Against a Nuclear Iran released a list of 16 American companies a few days ago -- among them Volvo, Honeywell, and Schlumberger -- all of which are cutting back on jobs employing Americans, but all of which expressed a desire to do business in Iran under the terms of the deal that was made with Tehran. My question is this: What is the administration's response to businesses who say they want to do business in Iran under a deal the President described as \"the worst ever?\"\nMR. SPICER: I think that speaks for itself. The President was very clear on what he thinks of the Iran deal, and companies need to abide by the law.\nQ: All right. My other question is this: Two weeks ago Monday, when the President met with some of us, he said -- it was on the record -- he would have an answer on the administration's policy toward the International Monetary Fund in a few days. It's been two weeks. Can we expect any time an announcement on what the administration will do regarding the IMF?\nMR. SPICER: I would be glad to follow up on that one and get back to you.\nDave.\nQ: Sean, the Governor Texas on Sunday signed a law that essentially outlaws sanctuary cities in the state of Texas. Do you view this as a positive step? And would you encourage other states to do the same?\nMR. SPICER: Obviously it's a positive step. I think it shows that, as we've discussed here, both from an economic and a security standpoint, that makes sense for the citizens of our country. Each governor, each mayor is going to have to make their own decisions, but I think the President's position is very clear when it comes to sanctuary cities and how we're going to try to address them going forward. Because it's not just an economic issue, it's not just a jobs issue, but it's a security issue for our country.\nAnd so I think ultimately, every elected official from the local level all the way up to President needs to feel comfortable with the laws that they're passing to make sure that they're protecting the people. I mean, ultimately that's what every government, first and foremost, responsibility is to its people.\nQ: What does this mean for the administration's position that these sanctuary cities should not be existing nationally? Will you still take action that denies funding to cities nationwide?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think it's a positive sign. I hope more follow the governor's lead. But we're going to do exactly what the President said and follow through on the executive orders he's made.\nMajor.\nQ: So, Sean, you've mentioned Director Clapper's testimony yesterday, said no evidence of collusion. But then he was also asked if he was aware of the FBI counterintelligence investigation, he said he was not. Therefore, he left the impression before the panel he could not give a definitive answer about the question of collusion. Do you accept that as a valid representation of his knowledge and the fact that this remains an open question?\nMR. SPICER: Sure, I mean, in the sense that I'm not going to question. But I think the interesting thing is on all the other issues that he testifies about everybody takes it as whole cloth, that if he says anything he must -- he was the DNI. So when you guys want him to speak for the entire 17 agencies, you sort of assume that that's what he's doing.\nIn this case, when he's been asked similar questions before and said, well, I can't speak to this case, generally speaking, I've seen nothing, the presumption is, therefore, he's got to be -- in this case, he's saying I have not and continue to -- do not see anything that shows an effort of collusion. As the DNI, I would ask you the same question, which is, at some point, given all that he was seeing and all that he was given access to, when at some point are you guys going to accept this idea that there was no collusion?\nQ: I'm asking you if you accept that he testified.\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: That they have equal weight; that, yes, at the time he said -- and the agencies said they found no evidence, that this\n-- a representative fact that you take as valid, and it's also representative of the fact that you take as valid he was not aware of an FBI counterintelligence investigation and, therefore, at this time cannot say conclusively there was no collusion. You give them equal weight, correct?\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: Okay, fine. On Afghanistan, because I think it's important what the President is thinking about -- you've been implying that ISIS is a part of the Afghanistan equation. And what I want to ask you about is, as the President looks on Afghanistan, as a team presents him options, are those options primarily about whatever ISIS component is in Afghanistan, or the larger, more malignant issue in Afghanistan, which has always been the Taliban?\nMR. SPICER: Okay, so there's as you know, multiple missions going on to confront those multiple things. The U.S. currently has about 8,400 forces in Afghanistan doing a counterterrorism operation, which is Operation Freedom Sentinel, and then the NATO mission, which is to train, advise and assist under Operation Resolute Support.\nThe main objective of us being in Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven for terrorists who attack the United States and our allies. That is the main objective. We remain very focused on the defeat of al Qaeda, its associates, as well as the defeat of ISIS-K, which is the ISIS affiliate there in Afghanistan. But that is, simply put, what the mission is going forward.\nQ: Okay. And when you suggest that it's a \"Washington question\" to ask if 15,000 can do a better job than 100,000, are you suggesting that the ideas the President is being presented with are so original and so out of the box that 15,000 troops can achieve what 100,000 deployed very shortly after 9/11 could not achieve?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm just suggesting that I think fully refining the mission, what we're seeking to achieve -- and that goes back to what Mara was saying -- what is the exact objective, how far away are we doing it, what's the time level that we have to have, can we grow the Afghan force, is there -- I mean, there are several things that go into a strategy.\nAnd I think the idea of just saying, can we throw X number at it is not the way that the President is looking at these options. He's trying to figure out -- walk back from a goal of eliminating this threat and then tell me how we get there, as opposed to, tell me how many troops we need and then what you're going to do with them.\nI think that there has been in the past, some instances of just figuring, okay, if we add more troops that will help solve the problem. The President is asking to re-look at the entire strategy, and then figure out what the footprint is in a variety of ways to get there. That is a different look at what the strategy is versus what it had been.\nQ: And one last thing. You suggested that when Sally Yates refused to enforce the executive order that vindicated the assumption you had that she might not have been a purely well-motivated government servant bringing over this evidence about Michal Flynn. On the other side of that, after Don McGahn looked at the evidence on February 2nd, was in fact Sally Yates' warning vindicated?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I don't know what Don saw. So I'm not privy to that --\nQ: But that led -- you told us that led to his firing, so it had to have some legitimacy, right?\nMR. SPICER: No, what led to his firing was that he misled the Vice President.\nQ: But wasn't that information about those conversations?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I can't get into -- I cannot get into, and I don't know, frankly, what was in those --\nQ: Should the country not assume that she was vindicated by that review of the evidence?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't think that they should assume anything. I think facts should guide it. And the bottom line is the President fired him for misleading the Vice President and he was --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I just said to you, Major, multiple times, and I said it at the time. So to go back -- at the time that it happened and right now, we continue to say that the Vice President was misled by General Flynn and the President asked for his resignation. Full stop.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, if I could come back to Paris.\nMR. SPICER: You can.\nQ: It's my understanding that the --\nMR. SPICER: Let's all go.\nQ: And one other one. It's my understanding that the President's initial inclination was to pull out of the Paris agreement. He suggested as much on the campaign trail. But the situation has become a little bit more complicated. The knock against the Paris Agreement is that it would have a detrimental effect on the U.S. economy if fully implemented. Does the President believe that there is a way to stay in the Paris Agreement -- maybe renegotiate the standards? Because he's under a tremendous amount of pressure from many of his own advisors, other countries, to stay in this agreement to some degree. Does he think he can make changes and still stay in it?\nMR. SPICER: I think the reason that he is seeking the advice of his team is to get options, and then he'll pursue the best one. But I'm not going to tell you which one that he's going to do. That's why he's continuing to meet with the team and to get advice. That's it, plain and simple.\nSteve.\nQ: Well, hang on. I got one other. Also, in the omnibus spending bill that the President signed was a provision to extend the EB5 visa program, and it's been pointed out that the company that Jared Kushner was recently in charge of has been aggressively reaching out to people in China to say invest in our property in Jersey City, remember the EB5 program -- that people that invest a certain amount in this country get the sort of golden visa program. Does the President see any potential conflict of interest there?\nMR. SPICER: I think Jared has no affiliation with that company anymore. He recused himself from it, sold his interest in it. So that's a question more for the company itself to ask.\nQ: So the President doesn't see any potential conflicts here?\nMR. SPICER: No. I mean, Jared did everything that was required to make sure that he recused himself and took all the steps necessary.\nSteve.\nQ: Just before the briefing, you put out a statement, Sean, that congratulates --\nMR. SPICER: Thank you for bringing that up. Yes.\nQ: Moon -- the liberal who ran in South Korea. He had actively campaigned, suggesting that the President's idea that South Korea pay its fair share of the THAAD missile system is a bad idea. He wants warmer relations with the North. Do you hope to convince him to change his mind?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President looks forward to meeting with him and talking about shared interests. So I'll wait for that conversation, and I'm sure we'll have a readout for you.\nQ: Second question: You did say that the President has an excellent relationship with his National Security Advisor, but there's been a widely circulating column written by Eli Lake that quotes the President -- two sources -- saying that his National Security Advisor -- is the General undermining my policy? Did the President say that?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't believe he has. I haven't seen him. I was with -- I mean, I think when you look at the President's schedule this week, as I just noted to Sarah a little while ago, there's probably no one, aside from family member,s that are spending more time with the President this week than General McMaster. He values his counsel, he continues to be extremely pleased with his pick and his performance as National Security Advisor, and he has the utmost confidence in him.\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Just a couple more questions on General Flynn. You keep saying that the White House was given a heads up by Sally Yates about what General Flynn had said to the Russians. She describes it differently, saying that she told the White House that General Flynn had been compromised by the Russians and was blackmailed by the Russians. Is that the position of the White House now, after seeing all the same evidence that Sally Yates saw -- that General Flynn was compromised and potentially blackmailed by the Russians?\nMR. SPICER: I think, look, we've commented on this. We made a decision based on actions that he took. The President asked for and accepted his resignation. We're not looking to re-litigate this.\nQ: Don't the American people deserve to know whether or not their National Security Advisor was --\nMR. SPICER: They need to know that the President took decisive action in this country's best interests and -- back to Steve's question -- made an excellent choice for National Security Advisor.\nQ: -- by a foreign adversary?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that you'll know. I mean, that's up for --\nQ: Well, Sally Yates came to that conclusion, so I'm asking you --\nMR. SPICER: No, she didn't. I think that's -- I don't know that that's -- for her to come to that conclusion without any investigatory method seems a little premature, don't you -- I mean, to say that --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no, no, but what I'm saying it --\nQ: Did the White House investigate whether or not their National Security Advisor was compromised by the Russians?\nMR. SPICER: As I've said multiple times, we looked into the situation, the President made a decision, and it was the right decision.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sean, a follow-up on that one. But first I wanted to ask you about FBI Director James Comey's testimony before the Senate, which now, apparently it looks like the FBI Director gave inaccurate testimony to the Senate. Is the White House concerned that he greatly exaggerated or misstated what kind of contact Huma Abedin had in terms of her emails and sending them to Anthony Weiner?\nMR. SPICER: I have not asked the President or the staff about that. But I mean, I think there's -- the one issue is I don't think there's any question by any account that there was classified information inappropriately shared on an unclassified system to an unclear person. I mean, that's, to me, I think, what continues to be the takeaway.\nQ: But is the White House concerned that the FBI Director apparently gave inaccurate testimony?\nMR. SPICER: At this point, I have not asked and I'm not fully aware of this. I mean, I'm aware of the testimony that occurred and the inquiries, but I have yet to follow up on that, and I'd be glad to follow up.\nQ: Does the President still have confidence -- full confidence -- in FBI Director James Comey?\nMR. SPICER: I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him. So I don't -- I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this.\nQ: And the last time you spoke about it, you said he did have confidence, but you're not sure to say that again now?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't -- in light of what you're telling me, I don't want to start speaking on behalf of the President without speaking to him first.\nQ: And then one follow-up on Flynn. The President, of course, had said that Flynn should ask for immunity before agreeing to testify. Does he still believe that?\nMR. SPICER: I think General Flynn should seek the advice of counsel and take their advice with respect to his investigation and the inquiries into his background, but that's a decision for him and his counsel.\nThank you guys very much. Have a great day.\nEND 2:48 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-09", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

To deal with this national emergency, Executive Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.\nThe President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.\nThe regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have been calling for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including with respect to chemical and biological weapons, supporting terrorist organizations, and obstructing the Lebanese government's ability to function effectively, continue to foster the rise of extremism and sectarianism and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures to deal with that emergency adopted on that date in Executive Order 13338; on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399; on February 13, 2008, in Executive Order 13460; on April 29, 2011, in Executive Order 13572; on May 18, 2011, in Executive Order 13573; on August 17, 2011, in Executive Order 13582; on April 22, 2012, in Executive Order 13606; and on May 1, 2012, in Executive Order 13608, must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2017. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.\nIn addition, the United States condemns the Assad regime's use of brutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Assad regime to stop its violence against the Syrian people, uphold the Cessation of Hostilities, enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and allow a political transition in Syria that will forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice.\nThe United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124254", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:49 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Light crowd.\nQ: Slow news day.\nMS. SANDERS: So I've heard.\nGood afternoon, everybody. As most of you, I think, know, Sean is on reserve duty for the rest of this week, so I will be briefing you today and in the following days. I've got a few announcements here at the top before I take your questions.\nI've an update on the tunnel collapse at the Hanford nuclear waste site in Washington State. The incident is moving from the emergency phase toward the recovery phase. After extensive testing, we remain confident at this point that there has been no indication of worker exposure or an airborne radiological release.\nPersonnel began taking steps to stabilize and fill the hole over the partially collapsed tunnel last night, and we expect those efforts to be completed today. The site remains closed to nonessential personnel. Dedicated experts on the ground are looking closely at what next steps should be taken with respect to mitigating future tunnel breaches.\nIn Washington, D.C. today, as Sean mentioned yesterday, the President is focused on preparations for his upcoming foreign trip. He met this morning with the Russian Foreign Minister, following on the visit of Secretary of State Tillerson to Moscow last month. A readout of that meeting went out about an hour ago, and I'd refer you to that for further questions on the meeting.\nOutside of D.C., as part of the administration's ongoing effort to address the opioid crisis in America, Secretary Price continues his listening tour, learning from those on the frontlines battling the epidemic. Today he will meet with officials in Maine and New Hampshire to discuss how the administration can best support the local initiatives to combat this tragedy.\nSecretary Zinke is in Utah today, visiting national monument sites and meeting with local officials to comply with the President's executive order that ordered a review of national monument designations. The Secretary also took another step to advance the President's America First offshore energy strategy by reversing an Obama administration action to halt scientific research in the Outer Continental Shelf.\nAnd Secretary DeVos is in Daytona Beach, Florida to deliver the commencement address at Bethune Cookman University. The university is a great example of a topnotch education HBCUs have historically provided and continue to provide to their students. And I know the Secretary is honored to be there today.\nThere's also another nugget of big news, as you guys may have been paying attention, in regard to the termination of the former FBI Director Comey. The President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey. The DOJ lost confidence in Director Comey. Bipartisan members of Congress made it clear that they had lost confidence in Director Comey. And most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director.\nAccordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his position. Before the news broke, the President spoke to several members of Congress to inform them of his decision. Those members are Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Senator Chuck Grassley, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Feinstein, Senator Lindsey Graham, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Congressman Bob Goodlatte. Later in the evening, he also spoke to Senator Bob Corker, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\nIn addition to all of the big news happening at the White House today, it is also my daughter, Scarlet's fifth birthday. And since I'm here and you guys are, I get to wish Scarlet a happy birthday. And with that, I think her first birthday wish would probably be that you guys are incredibly nice. (Laughter.) And now I will take your questions.\nHallie.\nQ: Sarah, I think it would be helpful to establish some of the facts, I have a couple broader questions for you. So, number one, yes or no, did the President direct Rod Rosenstein to write this memo on James Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: No, the President had lost -- again, like I said, he'd lost confidence in Director Comey, and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected. But he did have a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General on Monday, where they had come to him to express their concerns. The President asked they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received.\nQ: So it's the White House's assertion that Rod Rosenstein decided on his own, after being confirmed, to review Comey's performance?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. And I think most of America had decided on their own that Director Comey was not the person that should be leading the FBI, as evidenced by the numerous comments that we've seen from Democrat members in the House and Senate, Republican members, members of the FBI, and people across the board.\nQ: Since we're establishing the facts -- Senator Dianne Feinstein said she was told something different directly from the President. The President said he asked Rosenstein and Sessions to review this. Is she lying?\nMS. SANDERS: He asked them for their recommendation, based on the conversation that they had on Monday. He asked them to put that recommendation in writing. But they came to him on his own. And again, the President had lost confidence in Comey from the day he was elected. He wasn't sure that he should be --\nQ: Then why did Sean say he did? On May 3rd, Sean came out and said that the President had full confidence in his FBI Director? Why did he say that?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think -- again, he's questioned Director Comey's reason for needing to stay at the FBI. He had countless conversations with members from within the FBI. I think one of the big catalysts that we saw was, last week, on Wednesday, Director Comey made a pretty startling revelation that he had essentially taken a stick of dynamite and thrown it into the Department of Justice by going around the chain of command when he decided to take steps without talking to the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when holding a press conference and telling them that he would not let them know what he was going to say --\nQ: Then why did the President --\nMS. SANDERS: -- and that is simply not allowed.\nAnd somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein -- who everybody across the board has unequivocally said, this guy is a man of upstanding character and essentially the gold standard at the Department of Justice -- when you take an action like that, when you go around the chain of command in the Department of Justice, then you have to make steps and take action to make a recommendation to the President. And that's what he did.\nQ: -- Republicans say that they --\nQ: -- Russian investigation, Sarah? Does it have to do with the investigation into Russia? How do you respond to those criticisms?\nMS. SANDERS: John, go ahead. We'll come back to that, I'm sure.\nQ: Until you said from the podium just now that the President lost confidence in him over the last weeks and months, we had thought that this was all Rosenstein's doing. When was it that the President lost confidence in James Comey? What was the tipping point?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's been an erosion of confidence. I think that Director Comey has shown over the last several months and, frankly, the last year, a lot of missteps and mistakes. And certainly I think that, as you've seen from many of the comments from Democrat members, including Senator Schumer, they didn't think he should be there, they thought he should be gone. Frankly, I think it's startling that Democrats aren't celebrating this since they've been calling for it for so long.\nJohn.\nQ: Well, hang on --\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, a follow-up.\nQ: Don't forget, and I have another one I need to ask you, too.\nMS. SANDERS: I think there's a two-question limit around here.\nQ: To follow on that, you said that he made a lot of missteps and mistakes. Back at the end of October, this President was applauding the FBI Director when he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. So he seemed quite happy with him at that point. What changed?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I think the President's position. One he was a candidate for President, not the President. Those are two very different things. Once you take over leading the Department of Justice that's very different than being a candidate in a campaign. As you guys all know, there's a very clear distinction between those two things.\nI think also having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic just atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in the Department of Justice. Any person of legal mind in authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in the Department of Justice, particularly for somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, who has been part of the Justice Department for 30 years and is such a respected person -- when he saw that, he had to speak up on that action, and I think that was the final catalyst.\nQ: And just a real quick question on the meetings this morning. The President is accused by Democrats of trying to circumvent the Russia investigation by firing Comey; he meets with the Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador to the United States. He's accused of being Nixonian; he meets with Richard Nixon's Secretary of State. The timing of all of this, is it just ironic or is this the President poking a finger in his critic's eye?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, these were meetings that have been on the books for a while. They didn't just happen this morning. There's not a strategy to go after the Democrats on this.\nI think, frankly, the saddest thing is that the Democrats are trying to politicize and take away from something that the President should be doing. He should be meeting with the Foreign Minister. He should be meeting with people like Kissinger. And for them to try to attack him for doing his job, -- maybe they should spent a little more time doing their jobs, and we wouldn't have all the problems that we do.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sarah, isn't it true that the President had already decided to fire James Comey, and he asked the Justice Department to put together the rationale for that firing?\nMS. SANDERS: No.\nQ: When did he make the decision?\nMS. SANDERS: He made the decision for -- the final decision to move forward with it was yesterday. But I know that he's been contemplating it for a while.\nQ: But how do you explain what Dianne Feinstein says, that the President told her that he was concerned with the mess at the FBI and asked the Justice Department to look into it?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't speak for Senator Feinstein, but I did speak directly to the President and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director Comey go pretty much since the day he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at the Department of Justice.\nQ: But was the reason for the firing what was written by the Deputy Attorney General? Is that why he did it?\nMS. SANDERS: That was, I think, the final piece that moved the President to make that quick and decisive action yesterday.\nQ: What did he mean in the letter that he wrote informing Comey that he was being fired -- he said, on three separate occasions Comey had told him that \"I am not under investigation.\" What were those three occasions that the FBI Director told the President that he wasn't under investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the specifics of their conversations, but I can tell you that Director Comey relayed that information to the President.\nJeff.\nQ: Following up on that, Sarah, did the President ask Direct Comey whether he was under investigation when they were\n-- when they had these meetings?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to go into the specifics of their conversations.\nQ: Is the White House concerned that -- he obviously made a decision to stick that in the letter and to make that public. Are there any concerns that it was inappropriate that they had that type of a conversation?\nMS. SANDERS: No.\nCharlie.\nQ: How important was the FBI Director's failure to stop the leaks coming out of the FBI to the President? How important was that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's probably one of the many factors. You can't deny somebody -- that that wasn't a problem. And so I think that was just another one of the many reasons that he no longer had the confidence of the President or the rest of the FBI.\nQ: Can we expect more firings from the Justice Department?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of today. (Laughter.)\nQ: Going forward, does the President want the Department of Justice to shut down what he's called a \"taxpayer-funded charade\" investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: He wants them to continue with whatever they see appropriate and sees fit, just the same as he's encouraged the House and Senate committees to continue any ongoing investigations.\nLook, the bottom line is any investigation that was happening on Monday is still happening today. That hasn't changed. And, in fact, we encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us and we can continue to see exactly what we've been saying for nearly a year, there's no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. And we'd love for that to be completed so that we can all move on and focus on the things that, frankly, I think most of Americans are concerned with.\nQ: Even if they keep on wasting taxpayer money, he wants it to continue?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, nobody wants to waste taxpayer money. I think the President has made a priority of this. That's another reason we'd love for it to come to completion. But at the same time, I know that you all will not let this go until it does. And so we'd love for that to be completed. Let's put it behind us. Let's move on, and let's focus on what we need to do to turn our country around.\nQ: Sarah, two questions. One, was the White House aware at the time of this decision and announcement that grand jury subpoenas in the case of Michael Flynn had just gone out?\nMS. SANDERS: No, nor would we -- should we have been.\nQ: Do you know anything about that process?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I don't. I'd have to refer you to --\nQ: And does the White House believe that if these FBI investigations are going to proceed in these allegations of Russian interference, do you support continued funding, and support who to lead that investigation? Who is going to be running that right now? Are you confident that that could be McCabe, or does it have to be somebody else?\nMS. SANDERS: Right now I believe that would fall to the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. And we are incredibly confident in his abilities, as I believe you can tell by the rest of the Senate, including many Democrats, are as well. Given the fact that he was confirmed 94 to 6 and had overwhelming praise from both sides of the aisle, I think there's complete confidence in him.\nAnd another reason, frankly, for Director Comey to be out of the way so that they can have somebody leading this effort that everybody across the board has respect and confidence in. Nobody wants this to be finished and completed more than us so that we can focus on what we need to do here.\nQ: Sarah, the President said -- or excuse me -- Sean Spicer said just a week ago today the President has confidence in the Director. So, again, I'm sorry for not understanding this, but what has happened in the last seven days to shake the confidence? Was Sean lying at that point? Or did something happen in the last seven days?\nMS. SANDERS: Of course, you'd love to add that in. But certainly not. Again, I think one of the big things that took place was the process in the hearing on Wednesday where, again\n-- not to sound like a broken record, but since you guys keep asking the same questions, I guess it's only fair that I keep giving the same answers -- but you have somebody, the Director of the FBI, who reports to the Deputy Attorney General, going around the chain of command. That's simply not okay. That's not something that is allowed in the justice system, nor should it be. That's a huge problem. That, along with the corrections that had to take place over the last, I believe, 48 hours, those are all big problems and another, I think, kind of final piece that pushed the President to make the decision that he did.\nQ: Does he regret not doing it earlier, like on January 20th or January 21st?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I believe the President wanted to give Director Comey a chance, but he feels that he made the right decision, certainly.\nQ: Why did he do as he did it, if I could ask? Why did he have one of his long-time security advisors hand-deliver a letter to the FBI when the FBI Director was, in fact, in Los Angeles? Didn't he deserve a phone call or a face-to-face conversation? Why did he decide to do it like that?\nMS. SANDERS: He followed the proper protocol in that process, which is a handwritten notification. And at the same time, no matter how you fire someone, it's never an easy process, and so he felt like following protocol was the best thing to do.\nQ: Does he plan to speak to him?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that conversation.\nQ: Was the President aware that James Comey asked for more resources in the Russia investigation? And did that factor into his decision to get rid of Mr. Comey, the Director?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, and I think that would be a better question for the Department of Justice.\nQ: Can I ask a follow-up? On the campaign trail, President Trump frequently said \"lock her up,\" and he criticized the Department of Justice for not being harsh enough on Hillary Clinton. He actually praised Director Comey in October for having the guts to reopen the investigation. Why was he moved by a letter that said that Director Comey was, if anything, too harsh on Hillary Clinton? Why does that move the President to fire him?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think you're looking at two very different positions. The President was wearing a different hat at that time. He was a candidate -- not the President. Those circumstances certainly change when you become the President. And again, when you go around the chain of command in the Department of Justice, when you, like I said before, throw a stick of dynamite into the Department of Justice, that's a big problem and it's one that cannot be ignored.\nQ: But he already knew that, didn't he, Sarah? He already knew what Mr. Comey had done.\nMS. SANDERS: I think that this was -- my understanding is Wednesday was the first time the Director had openly and publicly made that statement and made that clear.\nQ: The statement today on the President's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov did not include anything on the reported incidents of violence in Chechnya against people in the LGBT community. Is the reason why that wasn't included in the readout is because the President is not informed on the issue?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry? Could you speak up a little bit?\nQ: Sure. Is the reason why that wasn't included in the readout is because the President isn't informed about the reports of anti-gay violence in Chechnya?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I mean a lot of times there are parts of the conversation that aren't specifically included in a readout. But I'm not aware -- I haven't had that conversation, so I don't know. I wasn't part of that meeting, so I can't speak to every detail. And I'd have to refer you to the readout on the specifics of what I know was discussed.\nQ: Has the President been briefed on this issue generally?\nQ: Was Syria --\nQ: Has the President been briefed on this issue generally?\nMS. SANDERS: That's something I'll have to get back to you on. I'm not 100 percent sure.\nQ: You said you want the Russia investigation to continue at DOJ. Would the White House oppose the appointment of a special prosecutor to continue to look into -- to continue the investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: We don't think it's necessary. You've got a House committee, a Senate committee, and the Department of Justice all working on this. I don't think that there's a necessary need at this point to add that. You've got the Deputy Attorney General, who I would say is about as independent as it comes due to the fact that he has such bipartisan support.\nQ: What gives you such confidence that the rank and file within the Bureau lost faith in the FBI Director? There's a special agent who is inside, who wrote us, who said: \"The vast majority of the Bureau is in favor of Director Comey. This is a total shock. This is not supposed to happen. The real losers here are 20,000 front-line people in the organization because they lost the only guy working here in the past 15 years who actually cared about them.\"\nSo what's your response to these rank-and-file FBI agents who disagree with your contention that they lost faith in Director Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with Acting Director McCabe later today to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the FBI -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI if he feels that that's necessary and appropriate. And we'll certainly provide further information on that meeting for you guys.\nQ: The organization that represents FBI agents is asking for a voice in the selection process of Mr. Comey's successor. Is that something the President supports?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had that conversation, but I know, at this point, it's being run through the Department of Justice. And so I would refer you to them on what that process looks like at this point in time.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Who did the President consult before making the final decision to fire James Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: The President spoke with a number of individuals, but at the end of the day, it was the President's decision.\nQ: And in between Monday night and Tuesday, when he decided to fire the FBI Director, did he speak again with the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that they spoke on Monday, and I believe the next follow-up was actually in writing. They may have spoken, as well, but I'd have to double-check.\nQ: Just to be clear, so is it accurate to pull away from the information that we have that Monday night the President made the final call, said I want this in writing as a recommendation, and then took that recommendation as the evidence that he wanted to provide to fire James Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: My understanding is the decision was actually made on Tuesday, but the first conversation that he had was on Monday, when there was an oral recommendation made, and the President requested that he see that in writing to review it further.\nBlake.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. You say you want to move on and focus on the thing that Americans care about. So let me ask you about that. You're somewhat halfway home on healthcare. You still have tax reform to do, a spending bill, debt ceiling, and infrastructure. That's just a handful.\nMS. SANDERS: Pretty big list.\nQ: Pretty big list, right? But what happened yesterday, you could argue, just widened the divide and made D.C. politics more toxic. So how do you go about accomplishing all of those things with, now, the heightened political environment that we're in?\nMS. SANDERS: Frankly, I'm surprised that it did create a divide since you've had so many Republicans and Democrats repeatedly calling for Director Comey to be gone.\nFrankly, I don't think it matters what this President says, you're going to have Democrats come out and fight him every single step of the way. I think that's one of the things that's wrong with Washington, and I think that's one of the reasons that we've got to get back to focusing on those issues and, frankly, draining the swamp a little bit further.\nQ: Was he surprised by the Democratic backlash? Did he anticipate it, considering some of the past statements?\nMS. SANDERS: How could he have, considering the fact that most of the people that are declaring war today were the very ones that were begging for Director Comey to be fired? If Hillary Clinton had won the election -- which, thank God, she didn't -- but if she had, and she had been in the same position, she would have fired Comey immediately, and the very Democrats that are criticizing the President today would be dancing in the streets celebrating. So it's just the -- I think, the purest form of hypocrisy.\nJennifer.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two questions. One, there's a report in Israel that indicates the President has made a decision not to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Can you confirm that? Has he made a decision on that?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has not made a decision yet, and is still reviewing that.\nQ: Also, President Erdogan, in his speech, I think, this morning, warned the President against moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Does that warning and warning from other Arab leaders play into his decision as he's considering this move?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the decision-making process here. All I can tell you is that he's still reviewing it, and as soon as we have a decision, I know we'll be happy to report back to you guys.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions, both related to the selection of a successor to Director Comey. When President Carter chose a FBI director, he had a blue ribbon panel advising him. Presidents Clinton and Obama interviewed several candidates. Is the President going to follow this pattern, or does he have some individual in mind at this point?\nMS. SANDERS: Right now, I know that there are several individuals being considered, and the first step will be determining the acting -- or, excuse me, the interim director. And that is being handled through the Department of Justice, and I would refer you to them for right now.\nQ: And the other question I was going to ask was --\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, yeah, I forgot you've got two.\nQ: I've got two. I'm pretty nice, Charlotte, aren't I?\nQ: Charlotte?\nMS. SANDERS: Scarlet. But that's okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: He doesn't get a question anymore.\nMS. SANDERS: It's a Southern baby.\nQ: Who's Charlotte?\nQ: Her daughter. Who's had a birthday.\nMS. SANDERS: Just want to make sure we got that in again. Happy birthday, Scarlet.\nQ: Scarlet!\nMS. SANDERS: \"Gone with the Wind,\" come on, John.\nQ: I was going to say it is a fact that the Association of Former FBI Agents and Veterans of the Bureau generally prefer people who have been agents themselves or have a background in the FBI. Only two former agents have been director in the last four decades. Will the President consider current or former agents for the position?\nMS. SANDERS: I would say that he's not ruling anything out at this point. But again, as of today, the Department of Justice is handling the first step in this process.\nQ: Should the Attorney General, who has recused himself from the Russia investigation, have any role in the selection of a successor? And given the fact that in his 100-day interviews, the President himself said he had confidence in Director Comey, at this podium the American people were told he had confidence in Director Comey, can people take at face value what the President says about personnel issues like this, or his views on things, if just two weeks later, he's out?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely, you can take full confidence in the words of the President. In terms of whether or not Attorney General Sessions should have a role -- look, the FBI is doing a whole lot more than the Russia investigation. I know everybody in this room and probably most of the media around the world would like to think that's the FBI's sole responsibility, but that's probably one of the smallest things that they've got going on their plate, and the 20,000 employees that work there. And so he should absolutely have a role in seeing who runs that agency and that department.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Does the President have confidence in the Acting Director?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, he does.\nQ: Okay. And secondly, you mentioned earlier that you're encouraging the FBI to move on from the investigation. Is it appropriate for the White House to be directing the FBI what to do with any investigation they're currently investigating?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that that was the nature or the intent of my comment, wasn't to direct the FBI, but I think it's simply -- we're fully compliant with helping this process move along. We'd like to see it completed so that, frankly, all of us can move on and focus on things that Blake listed earlier, like tax reform, like healthcare, like infrastructure. Those are big programs, big priorities for this administration. And, frankly, what we'd like to be the number-one thing that we're talking about here, today, every single day, is not FBI investigations but things that, frankly, affect American voters and American taxpayers every single day.\nQ: What exactly precipitated the Monday meeting? Was that because of the hearing last week and what he said there? Or did the Monday meeting that the President had with the DOJ officials come out of a longer process of consideration of Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: The Department of Justice officials were here for other business, not specifically to meet with the President on that. The topic came up, and they asked to speak with the President, and that's how it moved forward.\nQ: Did the President previously talk to Attorney General Sessions or Deputy Attorney Rosenstein about the possibility of going this way with Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, no.\nQ: Did it come up in the discussion process before the confirmation that the President was considering nominating Rosenstein -- did he talk about Comey with Rosenstein then?\nMS. SANDERS: No, not that I'm aware of.\nQ: The President's statement that he talked to Comey about whether or not he was being investigated raises several questions. Can you talk about why you're not willing to add any more to that about who asked for that and why that was discussed?\nMS. SANDERS: Who asked for what? I'm sorry.\nQ: About whether or not -- I mean, the President seems to be trying to exonerate himself in this. I mean, can you talk about why you won't add anymore to what that conversation was, how that took place, when it took place --\nQ: The three occasions -- could you clarify those three occasions and who initiated?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get into the specific details. I'll check and see if we have follow-up on that. But at this point, I'm not going to comment any further than what was spelled out in the letter.\nQ: Why was it in the letter? If you don't want to clarify or comment, why was it put in the letter in the first place?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think it was something that is far above my pay grade -- was decided to be included. And again, I'm not going to get into the specifics of that.\nThanks, guys, so much.\nEND 2:18 P.M.

And would you join me in congratulating Reverend Franklin Graham for bringing together this first ever World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians. (Applause.)\nReverend Graham, Senator Lankford, Senator Blunt, Congressman Smith, Congressman Hultgren, leaders of faith in public life across this country and across the world, to my brothers and sisters in Christ. (Applause.) I often say when people have asked me over the years what my philosophy is, I tell them I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order. (Applause.)\nIt is a distinct honor and, frankly, a humbling privilege to join you today at this first-ever Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians. Let me first and foremost bring greetings from my friend, a champion of the freedom of religion and the freedoms enshrined in our Bill of Rights, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm here on behalf of the President as a tangible sign of his commitment to defending Christians and, frankly, all who suffer for their beliefs across the wider world. I stand here today as a testament to President Trump's tangible commitment to reaffirm America's role as a beacon of hope and light and liberty to inspire the world. (Applause.) You are here from across this land and from distant others because America was and is and ever will be that shining city on a hill where men and women of faith throughout our history have been able to walk and openly worship their faith in God to the glory of God, and it will ever be true in these United States of America. (Applause.)\nAnd on behalf of our President, let me personally thank our host today. This is a man who I, having just recognized once -- someone who I'm blessed to call my friend, and the President is blessed to call a friend in Reverend Graham. And I want to thank all of you Christian leaders from so many faith traditions who have traveled to join us here today. To Cardinal Wuerl, Archbishop Pierre, Archbishop Tikhon, Metropolitan Hilarion, Bishop Anis, Patriarch Aphrem, Dr. Zacharias, Dr. Michael Youssef, Dr. Youssef, and all the faith leaders are here today.\nEach one of you bear witness to the power of truth to transform lives. And the people that you shepherd impact every corner of the world. And it's an honor to be with all of you today.\nAnd of course, let me also say how deeply humbling it is for me to stand today before the courageous men and women who are with us, who have stood without apology for their faith in Christ and suffered persecution across the wider world. Reverend Sami Dagher, Father Douglas Bazi, Reverend Eliseo Villar, Rashin Soodmand, Cheol Kang, Ishak Shehata, Ishmail, and so many others who are here with us today.\nYour faith inspires me. It humbles me. And it inspires all who are looking on today. Would you all join me in thanking the courageous believers who have stood for their faith under withering persecution who are with us here today? We are honored by their presence. (Applause.) On behalf of the President of the United States, I say from my heart to that number, we are with you. We stand with you. And we are here at this world's summit because of you.\nThe Bible tells us: \"All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\" And those of you gathered here today are emblematic of millions across the world. You've persevered through the crucible of persecution. You refused to be conformed to this world. You have chosen instead to be counted with those outside the city gate for your faith. And by your life, you bear witness to the truth that brings us together here at this summit.\nThe reality is, across the wider world, the Christian faith is under siege. Throughout the world, no people of faith today face greater hostility or hatred than the followers of Christ. In more than 100 countries spread to every corner of the globe –- from Iran to Eritrea, Nigeria to North Korea –- over 215 million Christians confront intimidation, imprisonment, forced conversion, abuse, assault, or worse, for holding to the truths of the Gospel. And nowhere is this onslaught against our faith more evident than in the very ancient land where Christianity was born.\nTwo millennia ago, the Disciples of Christ, the forefathers of our faith, fanned out from Israel in every direction to bring the good news that we proclaim across the globe to this day. And in the valleys of Syria, Palestine, the plains of Nineveh and the Nile, on the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates, they planted seeds of belief. They watered them with their sacrifice and their courage. They blossomed into fruit, and have borne fruit for the Gospel ever since.\nThe Christian communities where the message of our Lord was first uttered and embraced today, though, are often the targets of unspeakable atrocity. In Egypt, just recently, we saw bombs explode in churches in the very midst of the celebration of Palm Sunday. A day of hope was transformed into tragedy. I was just this weekend with a pastor who -- from Egypt who spoke of the images that day, of seeing the palms the people carried into church on the ground, marked with the blood of the injured.\nIn Iraq, at the hands of extremists, we've actually seen monasteries demolished, priests and monks beheaded, and the two-millennia-old Christian tradition in Mosul virtually extinguished overnight. In Syria, we see ancient communities burned to the ground. We see believers tortured for confessing Christ, and women and children sold into the most terrible form of human slavery.\nKnow today with assurance that President Trump sees these crimes for what they are: vile acts of persecution animated by hatred -- hatred for the Gospel of Christ. And so too does the President know those who perpetrate these crimes. They are them the embodiment of evil in our time. He calls them by name -- radical Islamic terrorists. (Applause.)\nFrom al Qaeda to al Shabaab, from Boko Haram to the Taliban, these extremist groups seek to stamp out all religions that are not their own, or even a version of their own that they approve. And believers from every background have suffered grievously at their hands. And this summit is about calling the attention to the world to those tragic circumstances.\nThe practitioners of terror harbor a special hatred for the followers of Christ, and none more so than the barbarians known as ISIS. That brutal regime shows a savagery, frankly, unseen in the Middle East since the Middle Ages. And I believe ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of the Christian faith, and it is time the world called it by name. (Applause.)\nNow, Christianity faces unprecedented threats in the land where it was given life, its creed in an exodus unrivaled since the days of Moses in some communities. In Syria, the Christian population has plummeted from one-and-a-quarter million to only 500,000 in just the past six years. In Iraq, followers of Christ have fallen by 80 percent in the past decade and a half due to the violence of extremism and acts against Christian communities.\nBut you know, it wasn't always like this. I saw it firsthand in 2004, shortly after the end of initial combat operations in Operation: Iraqi Freedom. I traveled to al-Basrah in Iraq. It was my first time overseas and in that part of the world. And I'll never forget, we met with local leaders -- political leaders and religious leaders -- our small delegation of congressmen.\nAnd there I witnessed something I'll never forget. I saw the local imam standing in his traditional apparel, and then as the local bishop arrived I saw the two of them embrace warmly, and began to speak with one another in animated ways. And the translator who was with me said that they were speaking about their families. The imam was expressing the appreciation that the bishop had expressed for condolences for the loss in their community. And there was warm affection between them.\nI turned to the State Department official who was traveling with us and said -- not knowing, I said, how long has there been a Christian church in al-Basrah? And he smiled and said, about 1,500 years. (Laughter.) It's a community of common purpose and affection. And it can be that way again.\nOur brother and sisters in faith, I can assure you are being carried by the prayers of the faithful across this nation and across the world. You have the prayers of our President and all the American people. And the Old Book says, not be anxious about anything but in every form of prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your request to God and the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\nSo know those of you that stare persecution in the face every day in distant lands, you have the prayers of the American people, prayers of my family, and you have the prayers of the President of the United States.\nThe suffering of Christians in the Middle East has stirred America to act, and it brings me here today. President Trump rightly said not long ago that -- of the Christian church, \"nobody has been treated worse in the Middle East.\" He's made it clear that America will stand by followers of Christ in this hour of need. Our administration is fully committed in bringing relief and comfort to believers not only across the Middle East but across the world. This President knows the terrorists will not stop until we stop them. And under President Donald Trump, we will stop them. (Applause.)\nIn President Trump, we not only have a leader who calls our enemy by name, we have a President who is confronting those who commit terror no matter the home or hut or cave in which they hide. In President Trump, I can promise you the armed forces of the United States of America, working with our allies in the region in Iraq and Afghanistan -- we will not rest, we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source. (Applause.)\nBecause of the action of President Donald Trump, ISIS is already on the run. Progress in Mosul is tangible. But the fight goes on. And I would say to each of you, persevere in prayer for those who wear the uniform and who are in this fight. Carry them in your prayers.\nI was out at Walter Reed Hospital not long ago with one of our servicemembers who had been injured been Mosul. And like all of our courageous men and women, the only thing he wanted to do was get better and get back and fight. So carry them in your prayers, the effective and fervent prayer of a righteous people avail of -- much. We ask you to avail yourselves to the opportunity to remember our armed forces as they fight for our freedom across the world.\nAnd rest assured, in the Middle East and North Africa, anywhere terror strikes, America stands with those who are targeted and tormented for their belief, whether they're Christian, Yazidi, Druzes, Shia, Sunni, or any other creed. The President's commitment to protecting people of faith also will not end with the elimination of ISIS or the eradication of terror. Under President Donald Trump, America will continue to condemn persecution of any kind, of any faith, any place, any time. We will stand against it with our ideals and with all our might.\nThe freedom to worship God according to the dictates of our conscience is at the very heart of who we are as Americans. In a very real sense, America was founded by people who had the courage to cross the Atlantic, motivated in so many cases to come here so that they might have that freedom of religion.\nTruth is, today, for all the prosperity of the freedom of faith in America and other free societies, today, according to the Pew Center, nearly 80 percent of the human family lives in places where restrictions on religion are either \"high\" or \"very high.\" It's a five-percent increase in a single year.\nToo many nations let the mob trample on the rights of the minority. Still more prefer the coercion of the state to conviction of the soul. And the limitations placed on people of belief have become too numerous to count. They range from violence to vandalism -- forced conversion to crush free speech, blasphemy laws to building codes, to detainment, to death.\nAcross the wider world, Christians face this and more. But to be clear, adherents of other religions across the world have not been spared. And we will speak for them and pray for them as well. For as history attests, persecution of one faith is ultimately the persecution of all faiths. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump will continue to stand without apology to protect this fundamental freedom, not just for our people but stand for it in the world. Since the founding of our nation, America has stood for the proposition that the right to believe and the right to act on one's beliefs is the right of all peoples at all times. Protecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of the Trump administration. (Applause.)\nUnder President Donald Trump, America will continue to stand for religious freedom of all people, of all faiths, across the world. And I believe that all God's children, no matter their country or their creed, can know with confidence that God will continue to guide this nation, to play our unique role on behalf of freedom in the world. So have confidence.\nWhen I first ran for office back in 1999 -- okay, when I first ran successfully for office -- (laughter) -- my wife presented me with a framed verse. It hung over our mantle for 12 years when I served in the Congress of the United States. And it hung over the mantle of the Governor's Residence in Indiana. Now it hangs over the mantle in the home of the Vice President of the United States of America.\nIt simply reads some ancient words people of faith have clung to throughout the millennia. And as we reflect on the great challenges at this world summit today that believers Christ face across the globe, I think we do well to claim this promise again. It simply reads, \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you hope, and a future.\"\nTrue words when they were first spoken by the prophet, every bit as true today. And so I want to encourage all of you today, fellow believers in Christ, cling to one another in these challenging times. Know that America stands with you and will labor alongside. But be confident because in the midst of it all, he knows the plans he has for us.\nAnd even as history records, even in times of persecution, this church has prospered, it's grown, it's had hope and a future. And with your continued courage and faith, and with the strong and unwavering support of America and its courageous President, Donald Trump, I know that future is bright indeed, now and in eternity.\nThank you very much. May God bless your ministries in this land and around the world. God bless you all and these United States of America.

SANDERS: Another light crowd today. Good afternoon. First off, before we get started, I'd like to bring up Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert to tell you about an executive order on cybersecurity that the President just signed. He'll take a few of your questions and, respectfully, I ask that you keep your questions for him on the topic of the executive order. And don't worry, I'll come back and answer all of the rest of your pressing questions as soon as he wraps up.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nMR. BOSSERT: Thank you, Sarah. Thank you very much for your time. Couple of things positive to report today, and the first is that President Trump, about an hour ago, signed an executive order on cybersecurity. And that executive order, among other things, is going to keep his promise that he has made to the American people to keep America safe, including in cyberspace.\nI'd like to do a few things. I'll promise you that we will distribute the executive order, but if I could, I'll preview the executive order for you, walk you through its three primary sections, some of its wave tops, and then take your questions.\nAmong other things, at least as an observation for me, I think the trend is going in the wrong direction in cyberspace, and it's time to stop that trend and reverse it on behalf of the American people. We've seen increasing attacks from allies, adversaries, primarily nation states but also non-nation state actors, and sitting by and doing nothing is no longer an option. So President Trump's action today is a very heartening one.\nThere are three sections. They're in priority order, in a sense. The first priority for the President and for our federal government is protecting our federal networks. I think it's important to start by explaining that we operate those federal networks on behalf of the American people, and they often contain the American people's information and data, so not defending them is no longer an option. We've seen past hacks and past efforts that have succeeded, and we need to do everything we can to prevent that from happening in the future.\nSo a few things on federal networks. We have practiced one thing and preached another. It's time for us now, and the President today has directed his departments and agencies, to implement the NIST framework. It's a risk-reduction framework. It is something that we have asked the private sector to implement, and not forced upon ourselves. From this point forward, departments and agencies shall practice what we preach and implement that same NIST framework for risk management and risk reduction.\nThe second, I think, of note -- point in protecting our federal networks is that we spent a lot of time and inordinate money protecting antiquated and outdated systems. We saw that with the OPM hack and other things. From this point forward, the President has issued a preference from today forward in federal procurement of federal IT for shared services -- got to move to the cloud and try to protect ourselves instead of fracturing our security posture.\nThird point I would make is that the executive order directs all its department and agency heads to continue its key roles, but it also centralizes risk so that we view our federal IT as one enterprise network. If we don't do so, we will not be able to adequately understand what risk exists and how to mitigate it.\nNumber of thoughts on that. Among other things, that is going to be a very difficult task. So modernizing is imperative for our security, but modernizing is going to require a lot of hard, good governance. And responsible for that today is the President's American innovation -- Technology Council, I'm sorry. The President's American Technology Council is going to run that effort on behalf of the President here out of the White House. And we have great hope that there will be efficiencies there, but also security.\nAnd I would probably note to you that other countries have taken two or three years to learn what we just came up with in two or three months, and that is that we can't promote innovation without first thinking through risk reduction. So doing that together is a message that we've learned, but doing it together is a message we'd like to encourage private sector folks to adopt.\nSo point two in the executive order is our critical infrastructure cybersecurity effort. The President has directed the President's Cabinet to begin the hard work of protecting our nation's most critical infrastructures -- utilities, financial and healthcare systems, telecommunications networks. He's directed them to identify additional measures to defend and secure our critical infrastructure. And he's continued to promote the message that doing nothing is no longer an option.\nSo the executive order not only requires his departments and agencies to help those critical infrastructure owners and operators and the most important ones, but to do it in a proactive sense. The message is a tilt towards action.\nWe've seen bipartisan studies, as an observation from me, over the last eight years, both parties. They've made powerful recommendations. They have not been adopted for various reasons. This executive order adopts the best and brightest of those recommendations, in my view.\nI'm going to stop with those three and take questions.\nQ: Two questions for you real quickly. First --\nMR. BOSSERT: Actually, if I could --\nQ: Yes, please. Brian.\nMR. BOSSERT: Brian, go ahead.\nQ: First, was the Russian hack in any way responsible or an impetus for this? Number two, I've talked to IT people who say putting stuff on the cloud actually can be problematic as far as security. So what additional security measures would you apply to the cloud to make sure that it's not as risky as some of the IT people tell us it would be?\nMR. BOSSERT: Couple questions there. So let me say three things first. The third section of the executive order -- may be the one I skipped over here a moment ago -- speaks to two halves. It speaks to not only the need to develop the norms and the interoperable, open communication system that is the Internet -- the United States invented the Internet and it's time to maintain our values on it -- but it also speaks to a deterrence policy which has long been overdue.\nAnd so the Russians are not our only adversary on the Internet, and the Russians are not the only people that operate in a negative way on the Internet. The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, other nation states are motivated to use cyber capacity and cyber tools to attack our people and our governments and their data. And that's something that we can no longer abide. We need to establish the rules of the road for proper behavior on the Internet, but we also then need to deter those who don't want to abide by those rules.\nSo the answer to your first question is, no, it wasn't a Russian-motivated issue, it was a United States of America-motivated issue.\nQ: And the second question about the cloud, that security on the cloud -- IT people say it's --\nMR. BOSSERT: If we don't move to shared services -- we have 190 agencies that are all trying to develop their own defenses against advanced protection and collection efforts. I don't think that that's a wise approach.\nThere's always going to be risk. And so your questions is, are we still at risk? Yes. I'm not here to promote for you that the President has signed an executive order and created a cyber-secure world in a fortress U.S.A. That's not the answer. But if we don't move to secure services and shared services, we're going to be behind the eight ball for a very long time.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. BOSSERT: You're welcome. Sir.\nQ: You said \"sitting around doing nothing.\" Is it your contention that the Obama administration, that was its approach to cybersecurity? Sitting around and doing nothing? Question one. And number two, you talked about one enterprise network. Does that mean every system throughout the federal government under this executive order, the ambition is to make them all the same? Or protected in the same way?\nMR. BOSSERT: No. So I'll answer them in reverse order, if I can.\nWhat we need to do is view the federal government as an enterprise as opposed to just viewing each department and agency as its own enterprise. So the Department of Homeland Security -- and Secretary Kelly will play a large and leading role in this effort in implementing the President's executive order -- as an enterprise. And their enterprise network covers 340,000 or so employees and their contractors and so forth. They are responsible, and that Secretary of each department and agency will remain responsible, for securing those networks.\nBut we need to look at the federal government as an enterprise as well so that we no longer look at OPM and think, well, you can defend your OPM network with the money commensurate for the OPM responsibility. OPM, as you know, had the crown jewel, so to speak, of our information and all of our background and security clearances.\nSo what we'd like to do is look at that and say, that is a very high risk, high cost for us to bear, maybe we should look at this as an enterprise and put collectively more information in protecting them than we would otherwise put into OPM looking at their relevant importance to the entire --\nQ: So their budget, in other words.\nMR. BOSSERT: No, not just their budget but based on what they do. So each department and agency has a responsibility to protect its own networks, but they now have a responsibility to identify their risk to the White House, to the President, so that we can look at what they've done and, just as importantly, what risk they know they're accepting but not mitigating. There's a lot of identified risk, but there's also a lot of identified and not remediated risk.\nSo that mitigation strategy is going to have to come through a centralized place. We've seen other countries, Israel and others, adopt a centralized view of risk management and risk-acceptance decisions. So that's the answer to your question.\nThe second question, though, maybe, is that --\nQ: \"Sitting around doing nothing.\" Is that the administration -- the previous administration's approach, from your vantage point?\nMR. BOSSERT: I think that the observation is that we have not done the basic block-and-tackling of thinking of the Internet as something that the American people benefit from. I think what we've done is focus on the federal IT portion of it. I think that a lot of progress was made in the last administration but not nearly enough. I think we're going to change that. And I think looking at this from the perspective of a deterrence strategy, to be honest, yes, I think the last administration should have done that, had an obligation to do it and didn't.\nQ: I was wondering if the administration has a view on what might constitute an act of war with regard -- what kind of cyberattack might constitute an act of war.\nMR. BOSSERT: There's a whole lot that we'll talk about in terms of what constitutes a cyberattack, what's war and what's not war. The Tallinn Manual and other things are important. But I think the most important answer to your question is that we're not going to draw a red line on cyberwar at this point today. It's not within the direct scope of the executive order. But it also would violate I think the President's primary mission he made to not telegraph our punches.\nIf somebody does something to the United States of America that we can't tolerate, we will act.\nQ: You said that the goal of this is to secure the Internet. You talked about the Internet as something that Americans use and enjoy. Well, the technical standards for most things on the Internet are put together by many international standards organizations and engineers, and things like that that often aren't in the United States. Has there been any talk of outreach to these sorts of bodies to try and build in security into the next generation of protocols?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, absolutely. So the message here is not just protecting the people of America. We have an \"America first\" perspective, but the idea of having likeminded people with similar viewpoints, like our allies, developing with us the open, operable Internet is something key to figuring out how we will define what is and is not acceptable.\nWe can't cut off the Internet at our borders and then expect it to operate in a viable way. And if there are good ideas coming out of Germany, then we'll take them. If there are good ideas coming out of Peoria, we'll take them as well.\nQ: You mentioned the American Technology Council a short time ago. We really don't have much of an indication that there's going to be, like, significant Silicon Valley or tech leaders who are going to be coming here. We know that there have been reports the President has had a few phone calls with someone like Mark Zuckerberg. Can you enlighten us a bit? Who can we expect to see here coming to the White House next month? Can we expect to see someone like Mark Zuckerberg working closely with the administration when it comes to that council?\nMR. BOSSERT: So let me go backwards a little bit. Instead of telling you who the President did and didn't talk to -- I'll probably get that wrong anyway -- I'll tell you that there's a lot to be learned from private industry. And among other things, that stuff needs to come into the White House in the appropriate way.\nAnd so we talk on a regular basis to leaders, some that are technical leaders, some that are business leaders. My point of calling out the American Technology Council was to point out that they're going to have a leadership role in modernizing our federal IT. And that has a lot of reasons, right? There's efficiencies and cost-savings that are beyond just security.\nSo this executive order speaks to the security component of it. And I would direct you then to the American Technology Council and their efforts as you look through and think about those other efficiencies.\nBut as an example, we've heard numbers that suggest the federal government spends upwards of $40,000 per employee on their IT service costs. And that is so out of line with private industry that Secretary Ross and others would probably have a very easy time buying and making a lot of money off of a company that's so poorly invested their dollars, and so I think you'll see that innovation come from that group of leaders and thoughtful people.\nAnd then in terms of what you'll see over the next month, I would say I don't know the answer to that specifically, but I'd like to take the opportunity and the opening before Sarah pulls me to thank two or three people, and one of them high on my list is Mayor Giuliani. I'd like to thank him for the advice he's given to me and to the President and to others as we formulate this thinking. I'd like to thank Representative McCaul. I'd like to thank a few other members of Congress -- Representatives Ratcliffe and Hurd; Representative Nunes, Senator Collins, Senator McCain, in particular; Senators Burr and Whitehouse. There's a number of people that provided thought leadership and taken action to pass legislation -- all those things that we've liked and that has improved our cybersecurity over the last eight years.\nSo I don't want to be critical of things that have happened over the last eight years, but I do want to look forward to improvement.\nQ: Can you -- a former Obama administration official who dealt with other countries and other entities in other countries -- he said that there were tens of thousands of attempts to hack into government systems daily. Can you quantify, can you confirm or deny that?\nMR. BOSSERT: No. The answer for \"no\" is that we see that happen and we then start getting into a numbers game. And what I think would be a better argument right now -- not to cut off that question, it's a reasonable one, but the better answer here is for us to figure out how we can provide a better collective defense of our federal IT and those networks and data that we operate. If we do it based on an individual attack basis, we're probably looking at it in the wrong way.\nQ: So was this person correct when they said entities from around the world --\nMR. BOSSERT: I would say it this way, without numbers -- the trend line is going in the wrong direction. We see additional attacks, additional numbers, additional volume, and occasionally additional successes that trouble us. And that's the best way I can quantify that for you today.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. BOSSERT: You're welcome. Thank you.\nQ: Can you just say why the cybersecurity order was delayed? This was going to come out one day early in the administration. And there had been a lot of talk about concern from Silicon Valley and tech leaders with the direction that it was going in. So are those -- do you have some sense of the kind of support that this order has, or not, from the tech world?\nMR. BOSSERT: I want to answer you and even reject part of your question, if I can, and I think that will be clarifying. So first, I'll reject one part of your question. So we did see some concerns, but I don't think that they remain. And I look forward to their response after they read the President's executive order today.\nOne of those concerns, for example, arose when they read the voluntary call of the President's executive order, which I applaud today, that we reduce greatly the number of botnet attacks in the United States -- the distributed denial of service attacks. That's going to require voluntary cooperation among all the different owners and operators of different privately held companies -- from service providers to manufacturers of goods. And those things are going to have to happen voluntarily.\nWhat the President calls for is for the government to provide the basis for that coordination, without defining who's in and who's out -- it's a voluntary operation. But we know that they have the technical capacity, if they have the will, to come together on behalf of the American people and reduce those botnets dramatically. And the President is calling for them to do that. He's asking for the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Commerce to facilitate that.\nAnd what we thought we saw was reflections of a concern that there would be a compulsion, and I think that's something that I can put to rest today -- and that's why I poked into your question a little bit.\nBut then, if I could, the broader question of delay, I don't really much take that either. I think sometimes we've been criticized for doing things too quickly, and now maybe we're being criticized for doing things to slowly. So maybe I'm right in the middle of the sweet spot, I would argue. But I think the President has hit this timing perfectly.\nAnd I'll tell you three reasons why. One of the block-and-tackle things that he directed us to do before the executive order was to get the money right. He's picked a Cabinet full of people that know that business operations and business functions have to follow first so that you can then provide policy that he can implement -- right? So policy sets direction and vision, but if you don't have the right money and back-office infrastructure and so forth to implement those things, then you have to either change your vision or change your amount of money.\nAnd so, just off the top of my head, I just thought you might ask that question. The first I already preemptively answered, and that is that we tend to learn a lesson here that we don't want to innovate with policy on the innovation side, and secure with policy on the security side without doing that in tandem. And you saw the President signed on Friday last the Technology Council and he signed today the cybersecurity order. And that was done intentionally.\nAnd then, lastly, in between now and then, the President's FY18 budget allocated $319 million to DHS's cybersecurity budget alone. We have dedicated an increase of $1.5 billion across all departments involved in protective cyberspace.\nSo, from my perspective, both his first budget request and his future ones have right-sized and aligned that amount of money, keeping America safe. And that might answer all three components of your question.\nAnd with that, I know Sarah wants to pull me away. So thank you so much for your time.\nQ: -- the President address concerns Americans might have about political motivations that these cybersecurity companies like -- for instance, you mentioned Facebook -- they're very political --\nMS. SANDERS: Maybe Tom could come back to questions later. Thank you so much, Tom. And actually, he was wrong on one thing -- I would gladly have let him stay up here and talk cybersecurity with you all day. (Laughter.)\nI have a few announcements. And then, as promised, I will get to, I'm sure, all of your many pressing questions. I'd like to announce that the President also just signed another executive order establishing a bipartisan presidential advisory commission on election integrity. This will be chaired by Vice President Mike Pence. The President is committed to the thorough review of registration and voting issues in federal elections. And that's exactly what this commission is tasked with doing.\nThe bipartisan commission will be made up of around a dozen members, including current and former Secretaries of State, with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach serving as vice chair. It will also include individuals with knowledge and experience in elections, election management, election fraud detection, and voter integrity efforts.\nFive additional members that have been announced as of today -- Connie Lawson, the Secretary of State of Indiana; Bill Gardner, Secretary of State of New Hampshire; Matthew Dunlap, the Secretary of State of Maine; Ken Blackwell, former Secretary of State of Ohio; and Christy McCormack, a commissioner on Election Assistance Commission.\nThe commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people's confidence in the integrity of federal elections, and provide the President with a report that identifies system vulnerabilities that lead to improper registrations and voting. We expect the report will be complete by 2018.\nThe experts and officials on this commission will follow the facts where they lead. Meetings and hearings will be open to the public for comments and input, and we will share those updates as we have them.\nIn Cabinet news, Secretary Perdue is in Cincinnati, Ohio today to announce the Agriculture Department's plan for reorganizing to provide better service to the American people, as the President directed in his March 13th executive order. With the barges of the Ohio River behind him, many of which contain products that are beginning a journey that will ultimately take them to markets overseas, Secretary Perdue will announce a new mission area for trade and foreign agriculture affairs, recognizing the growing importance of international trade to the agriculture sector of the economy.\nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement will hold a press conference at 2:15 p.m. today -- probably not too far away -- to announce the results of a highly successful recent gang surge operation. The President has made enforcement of our nation's immigration laws a top priority, and today's announcement will underscore not only that commitment but his focus on targeting transnational gangs and prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety.\nAlso today, Secretary Mattis met with the Turkish Prime Minister in London to discuss a range of bilateral security issues, and the Secretary reiterated the United States' commitment to protecting our NATO ally. And both leaders affirmed their support for peace and stability in Iraq and Syria.\nOne other thing I wanted to point out -- last night, Obamacare suffered another serious blow as Aetna announced its decision to pull out of the Nebraska and Delaware marketplaces, which ends their participation in exchanges completely. They've sustained hundreds of millions of dollars over the last several years and is projected to lose more than $200 million in 2017. The company attributes those losses to structural issues within the exchanges \"that have led to coop failures and carrier exits and subsequent risk pool deterioration.\"\nThis latest news adds to the mountain of evidence that Obamacare has completely failed the American people, and reinforces why there is no time to waste in repealing and replacing this law before it takes our entire healthcare system down with it.\nFinally, I know -- those hands -- I know we sent out a timeline regarding the former -- the firing of former Director Comey yesterday, because there seemed to be some misperceptions about the meeting between the President and the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General on Monday. But I'm going to read it to you all again just to make sure we're all on the same page, because I want the sequence of events to be perfectly clear to everyone.\nThe President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey. After watching Director Comey's testimony last Wednesday, the President was strongly inclined to remove him.\nOn Monday, the President met with the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General and they discussed reasons for removing the Director.\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 9th, the Deputy Attorney General sent his written recommendation to the Attorney General and the Attorney General sent his written recommendation to the President.\nHopefully, that clears up some of those things. And with that, I will take your questions.\nSteve Holland.\nQ: Sarah, in the Lester Hold interview the President just had he made a number of remarks. Why did the President think that James Comey was a \"showboat\" and \"grand-stander\"?\nMS. SANDERS: I think probably based on the numerous appearances that he made, and I think that it's probably pretty evident in his behavior over the last year or so with the back-and-forth. And I think that it speaks pretty clearly -- those words don't leave a lot of room for interpretation, so I think it's pretty clear what he meant.\nQ: When were these three conversations that the President had with James Comey about whether he was under investigation? He said one was at dinner, two phone calls. Was that since January 20th, or when?\nMS. SANDERS: That's my understanding. I don't have exact on when those phone calls took place.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sarah, two parts of the Comey question regarding the interview the President just gave. First of all, isn't it inappropriate for the President of the United States to ask the FBI Director directly if he's under investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I don't believe it is.\nQ: But one of these conversations the President said happened at a dinner where the FBI Director, according to the President, was asking to stay on as FBI Director. Don't you see how that's a conflict of interest -- the FBI Director is saying he wants to keep his job, and the President is asking whether or not he's under investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't see that as a conflict of interest, and neither do the many legal scholars and others that have been commenting on it for the last hour. So, no, I don't see it as an issue.\nQ: But, Sarah, the other question I want to ask you about is, I asked you directly yesterday --\nMS. SANDERS: That will be three, I think.\nQ: Different subject related to Comey. I asked you directly yesterday if the President had already decided to fire James Comey when he met with the Deputy Attorney General and Attorney General, and you said, no. Also the Vice President of the United States said directly that the President acted to take the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General to remove the FBI Director. Sean Spicer said directly, \"It was all him,\" meaning the Deputy Attorney General. Now we learn from the President directly that he had already decided to fire James Comey. So why were so many people giving answers that just weren't correct? Were you guys in the dark? Was the Vice President misled again, as happened with Mike Flynn --\nMS. SANDERS: I know you'd love to report that we were misled and what it creates -- I let you finish and read off every single one of those statements, so unless you want to trade places, I think it's my turn now.\nI think it's pretty simple. I hadn't had a chance to have the conversation directly with the President to say -- I'd had several conversations with him, but I didn't ask that question directly, \"had you already made that decision.\" I went off of the information that I had when I answered your question. I've since had the conversation with him, right before I walked on today, and he laid it out very clearly. He had already made that decision. He had been thinking about it for months, which I did say yesterday and have said many times since. And Wednesday I think was the final straw that pushed him. And the recommendation that he got from the Deputy Attorney General just further solidified his decision and, again, I think reaffirmed that he made the right one.\nQ: Was the Vice President in the dark, too?\nMS. SANDERS: Nobody was \"in the dark,\" Jonathan. You want to create this false narrative. If you want to talk about contradicting statements and people that were maybe in the dark, how about the Democrats. Let's read a few of them. You want to talk about them? Here's what Democrats said not long ago about Comey. Harry Reid said Comey should resign and be investigated by the Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer said, \"I don't have confidence in him any longer.\" Senator Bernie Sanders said it would not be a bad thing for the American people if Comey resigned. Nancy Pelosi said Comey was not in the right job. Former DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Shultz said that she thought Comey was no longer able to serve in a neutral and credible way. President Obama's advisor, Valerie Jarrett, reportedly urged him to fire Comey. Just yesterday, Representative Maxine Waters said that Hillary Clinton would have fired Comey.\nIf you want to talk about people in the dark? Our story is consistent. The President is the only person that can fire the director of the FBI. He serves at the pleasure of the President. The President made the decision. It was the right decision. The people that are in the dark today are the Democrats. They want to come out, they want to talk about all of these -- they love Comey and how great he was.\nLook at the facts. The facts don't lie. Their statements are all right there. I think it's extremely clear that -- and, frankly, I think it's kind of sad -- in Washington, we finally have something that I think we should have all been able to agree on, and that was that Director Comey shouldn't have been at the FBI, but the Democrats want to play partisan games. And I think that's the most glaring thing that's being left out of all of your process stories.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ: Sarah, you said from the podium yesterday that Director Comey had lost the confidence of the rank and file of the FBI. On Capitol Hill today, the Acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe directly contradicted that. What led you and the White House to believe that he had lost the confidence of the rank and file of the FBI when the Acting Director says it's exactly the opposite?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I can speak to my own personal experience. I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the President's decision. And I think that we may have to agree to disagree. I'm sure that there are some people that are disappointed, but I certainly heard from a large number of individuals -- and that's just myself -- and I don't even know that many people in the FBI.\nQ: And a question to what you were saying about the Democrats. Clearly, they didn't like James Comey too much after the October 28th pronouncement that he was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Their point now is the timing is different, that this was in the middle of an investigation. Do they have a point?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. And I think Mr. McCabe made that point far better than I could today when he said that there's been no impediment to the investigation. And as I said before, any investigation that was taking place on Monday is still taking place today. So I think that's, again, another sad story by the Democrats that they're trying to peddle.\nMara.\nQ: Thank you. Another comment from the hearing today -- the Acting Deputy Attorney General said -- I'm sorry, McCabe said that he considers the investigation into Russian meddling in the election to be highly significant. In the past, the President has said that the investigation was a hoax, and he's questioned even recently whether maybe it wasn't Russia, it might have been China. Does the President consider this investigation to be highly significant?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think he would love nothing more for this investigation to continue to its completion. I think one of the reasons that the \"hoax\" component is the collusion component that has been the false narrative that you guys have been pushing for the better part of a year. I think that's the piece that he is repeatedly talking about being the hoax.\nQ: But in terms of the threat to national security, does he take that seriously? Does he think that's significant? Putting aside the --\nMS. SANDERS: Of course, he takes national security seriously. I mean, to even hint that he doesn't I think is to misunderstand this President completely. From the very moment that he stepped onto the campaign stage, to the day that he took the oath of office to become President, he has talked about national security. He's made that one of the biggest priorities in the administration. You just saw Tom Bossert here talking about cybersecurity. On all fronts, whether it's securing the border, whether it's protecting people abroad here, the President has been focused on that.\nQ: Does the think what Russia did during the election was a threat to U.S. national security?\nMS. SANDERS: You know, I haven't had the chance to ask him about that. I think we're still waiting on the final conclusion of that investigation.\nQ: Is he open-minded about that? He doesn't know --\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think any time we have somebody interfering with our election, that would be considered a problem, and I think the President would certainly recognize that.\nMatthew.\nQ: Sarah, I appreciate it. Two questions. First, as has been mentioned, Vice President Pence yesterday said the firing was based on the recommendation of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General. We know now that that's not true. Was the Vice President misled again, or did he mislead the American people?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe I answered that question.\nQ: But if you have, I don't think I caught it, because the Vice President said yesterday that the President chose to accept and support the decision of the Deputy Attorney General and Attorney General.\nMS. SANDERS: He certainly accepted the Deputy Attorney --\nQ: (Inaudible) going to do it either way.\nMS. SANDERS: But that doesn't mean that he wouldn't still accept his recommendation. I mean, they're on the same page. Like, why are we arguing about the semantics of whether or not he accepted it? They agreed. I mean, I'm not sure how he didn't accept the Deputy Attorney General's recommendation when they agreed with one another.\nQ: So if I may just switch topics slightly. If the President knew he was going to do this, why ask for those memos to begin with? Why not just fire Comey? Why have these memos put out and then explain that he did it because of the memos, but then say that he was going to do it either way? I'm confused as to why we even got those memos.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think he wanted it to get the feedback from the Deputy Attorney General, who the Director of the FBI reports to. Again, it further solidified the decision that he had made. The only person that can fire Comey was the President. He made that decision. It was clearly the right one, as evidenced by all of the comments, both by House and Senate Democrats, Republicans, and many people within the FBI.\nI think instead of getting so lost in the process -- did this happen at 12:01 or 12:02, did he fire him because he wore a red tie or a blue tie -- he fired him because he was not fit to do the job. It's that simple. This shouldn't be a complicated process. The President knew that Director Comey was not up to the task. He decided that he wasn't the right person in the job. He wanted somebody that could bring credibility back to the FBI. That had been lost over these last several months. The President made that decision. He made it; he moved forward. It was the right one. I don't think that the back-and-forth makes that much difference.\nQ: Did you call on me?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, I'm sorry.\nQ: Okay, thank you. Sarah, going back to what you said about Democrats -- yeah, you have some Democrats that say that Comey should have been fired, but they're questioning the timing. Why now? Even though the Deputy Attorney General did do that, they're questioning why now. He couldn't wait anymore?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that I've answered this. I hate to again just keep repeating myself, but we're kind of getting lost on the same questions here. He had decided that he wasn't fit. There's never going to be a good time to fire someone, whether it's on a Tuesday or a Friday.\nQ: Why not day one, when he comes in?\nMS. SANDERS: He decided he wanted to give Director Comey a chance. He did. And he felt like he wasn't up to the task.\nQ: And then last question: Monday, Sean Spicer, when he was at the podium, he said after the testimony with Clapper and Yates, he said -- he talked about there was no collusion from what Clapper said. But he also said that there needs to be a timeline when the Russia investigation ends. And then yesterday you said it should continue. Which one is it? Should it continue or should it end? Because Spicer said the President wanted it to end, Monday. And now, yesterday, you said it should continue. I mean, I'm just trying to find out which one it is.\nMS. SANDERS: I've said that we wanted to come to its completion. We wanted to continue until it is finished, which we would like to happen soon, so that we can focus on the things that we think most Americans, frankly, care a whole lot more about. I think the people in this room are obsessed with this story, a lot more than the people that we talk to and we hear from every day. We'd like to be focused on the problems that they have. That's the point -- is we'd love for this to be completed. But we also want it to be completed with integrity. And I think that was one of the other reasons, frankly, that I think that the decision the President made was the right one, because I think it adds credibility and integrity back to the FBI where a lot of people, frankly, were questioning.\nQ: We now know the President fired the FBI Director with more than six years left on his 10-year term because he was a show-boater, a grandstander. How important is it that the next FBI director not be a show-boater or a grandstander? And how important is it that this person show loyalty to the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the main factor that they're looking for is that they're loyal to the justice system, they're loyal to the American people. This President is looking for somebody who can come in, that is independent, and has the support, I think, across the board, whether it's Republicans, Democrats, members of the FBI, and certainly the American people.\nAgain, it wasn't just one thing that caused the President to make this decision. A large part of why he made this decision was because he didn't feel like Director Comey was up to the job. He had watched -- it was just an erosion of confidence that he had in his ability to carry out the task that needed to be done. He's looking for somebody who can do that.\nJordan.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions. First, I want to follow up on what John asked about, the rank and file of the FBI. Don't you think the acting director of the FBI has a better handle on the rank and file than you do?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I'm not going to get in a back and forth on who has a better handle. Again, I've heard from multiple individuals that are very happy about the President's decision, and I know that it was the right one. I believe that most of the people that we've talked to also believe it was the right decision to make.\nQ: And I want to also ask about the meeting yesterday between President Trump and the Russian Foreign Minister. Can you walk us through how a photographer from either a Russian state news outlet or the Russian government got into that meeting and got those photographs out?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah. The same way that they would -- whoever the President was meeting with when it comes to a foreign minister or a head of state. Both individuals had official photographers in the room. We had an official photographer in the room, as did they.\nQ: Usually, media -- independent media in the U.S. is typically invited into those meetings. Why didn't that happen in this case?\nMS. SANDERS: It varies, actually. Not always. Particularly sometimes, the protocol, when it is not the head of state, and prior to the President meeting with the head of state, that wouldn't always take place. So, again, proper protocol was followed in this procedure.\nQ: Has the President been questioned by the FBI with regard to their investigation into Russian interference in the election?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: Does he expect to be?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a chance to ask him that question, so I don't know. I'm not going to guess on what he may expect.\nMajor.\nQ: So, at the Justice Department, there's a general protocol that discourages conversations with the President of the United States by the FBI director about anything that might involve the President. That's the general aspect of the protocol that's usually required to ensure that there is no confusion about political interference of any kind, of even the impression or the appearance of political influence on the FBI. That's the standard procedure. You just said here it was appropriate for the President of the United States to ask whether or not he was under investigation. Why is it appropriate if that's not consistent with the guidelines at the Justice Department to avoid that very encounter?\nMS. SANDERS: We've talked to several -- again, several legal scholars have weighed in on this and said that there was nothing wrong with the President asking that question.\nQ: So the Justice Department should change its protocol on this?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't seen their protocol. I'm only speaking to the information that I have at this --\nQ: What you think and the President thinks.\nMS. SANDERS: No, it's what I think. I mean, look at the people that followed up the interview. There were multiple attorneys that came on after and specifically stated that it was not inappropriate and it wasn't wrong for the President to do so. So, again, I can only base it off -- I'm not an attorney, I don't even play one on TV -- but what I can tell you is what I've heard from legal minds and people that actually are attorneys, and that's their opinion. So I have to trust the justice system on that fact, too.\nQ: Would you say, based on the experience that you and Sean and this communications office had Tuesday and Wednesday, that you were given all of the best information to relay to the American public, through us -- and your job is to relay that information to the American public; we're only intermediaries -- about what happened with this firing and the rationale for it?\nMS. SANDERS: It's funny that you mention intermediaries. You seem to take a much more proactive approach most of the time. But I'll go with intermediaries for today.\nLook, I think we were absolutely given the information that we could have at that time. It was a quick-moving process. We took the information we had, as best we had it, and got it out to the American people as quickly as we could.\nQ: And would you say that that information was accurate then or is more accurate now?\nMS. SANDERS: I would say that after having a conversation with the President, you don't get much more accurate than that.\nQ: And so by that standard, should reporters and the country essentially wait for a pronouncement from the President before believing that which is stated on his behalf by the White House communications staff?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, Major, I'm not going to get into back and forth, that we have to have like a direct quote every single time. In this process, I gave you the best information I had at the moment. I still don't think that it contradicts the President's decision. You guys want to get lost in the process.\nQ: I don't think asking you a question and getting an answer is lost in the process, Sarah, with all respect.\nMS. SANDERS: And I'm answering those questions. It's very simple: The President decided to fire Director Comey. Nobody else gets to make that decision. And he made it, he stands by it, as do the rest of us.\nQ: Two questions. Following up on this, back in, I think, October of last year, the former President was highly criticized by members of the FBI and other ethical folks outside of the FBI for making some comments on television that sort of suggested that he had an opinion about how the Hillary Clinton email case should go. And the charge was that he was interfering, that he was putting his thumb on the scale of an ongoing, active investigation. There was a lot of criticism from Republicans of the President about that.\nTalk to me about how that -- how what this President did in his series of conversations with the FBI director doesn't go far beyond what former President Obama did? And to Major's point, how can you argue -- regardless of maybe some pundits on TV who might be saying otherwise -- how can you argue that that doesn't have an appearance of trying to influence an investigation that's actively going on?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President has encouraged this investigation to take place and complete so that we can move forward. We've been as compliant as possible throughout the entire process. We will continue to do so. Nobody wants this investigation to go forward complete and end with integrity more than the President.\nQ: But people clearly know which way he wants it to come out, right?\nMS. SANDERS: On the right side. I think that he wants it to come out -- he's very well aware of the actions he has or hasn't taken. He knows he didn't take any action. And I think he's ready for the rest of you guys to understand that as well.\nQ: And one last question, just to follow up on the FBI thing. And I'm not trying to be overly combative here, but you said now today, and I think you said again yesterday, that you personally have talked to countless FBI officials, employees, since this happened.\nMS. SANDERS: Correct.\nQ: I mean, really? So are we talking --\nMS. SANDERS: Between like email, text messages -- absolutely.\nQ: Like 50?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes.\nQ: Sixty, seventy?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we're not going to get into a numbers game. I mean, I have heard from a large number of individuals that work at the FBI that said that they're very happy with the President's decision. I mean, I don't know what I else I can say.\nQ: Sarah, there's a report from The Wall Street Journal that the Deputy Attorney General asked the White House Counsel to correct the version of events that was coming out initially after the Comey firing. Is that accurate? And does that contribute to the different version of events that we've seen over the last 48 hours?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of a specific ask for a correction. I do know that we all want to make sure that we get this right. And that's been our -- what we've attempted to do all along. It's the reason we sent the update last night. I know there were several questions after the briefing yesterday, and I addressed that again in the opening today. Our goal is to get this as right and clear as we can.\nQ: And did the President know that Comey had sought more resources before his investigation, before he made the decision?\nMS. SANDERS: No. And I also think, based on what I've seen, the Department of Justice has also pushed back and said that that's not accurate. But I would refer you to them.\nSarah.\nQ: So, Sarah, was it a mistake for the White House to try to pin the decision to fire James Comey on Rod Rosenstein?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think there was ever an attempt to pin the decision on the Deputy Attorney General.\nQ: -- it was on his recommendation.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think his recommendation, again, it was extremely clear. The President, though, makes the decision. The buck stops with him. Nobody has ever tried to say that this wasn't the President's decision, that he wasn't the one that carried it out. And to try to, I think, conflate those things is just not what took place. We know that the President has been thinking about this for a long time. Wednesday, it certainly, I think, expedited that -- the Director's testimony from last Wednesday. And then getting the recommendation from the Deputy Attorney General I think just further solidified the President's decision.\nQ: And just to clarify one thing you said. You said the President has encouraged this investigation into Russia. He wants to see it reach its completion sooner rather than later. How has he encouraged it if he just fired the man who was overseeing the Russia investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: There are multiple people that are part of this, and it's not just the FBI. You've got the House Committee, the Senate Committee.\nLook, again, the point is, we want this to come to its conclusion. We want it to come to its conclusion with integrity. And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 2:29 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on May 16.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124263", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to protect American innovation and values, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Cybersecurity of Federal Networks.\n(a) Policy. The executive branch operates its information technology (IT) on behalf of the American people. Its IT and data should be secured responsibly using all United States Government capabilities. The President will hold heads of executive departments and agencies (agency heads) accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises. In addition, because risk management decisions made by agency heads can affect the risk to the executive branch as a whole, and to national security, it is also the policy of the United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise.\n(b) Findings.\n(i) Cybersecurity risk management comprises the full range of activities undertaken to protect IT and data from unauthorized access and other cyber threats, to maintain awareness of cyber threats, to detect anomalies and incidents adversely affecting IT and data, and to mitigate the impact of, respond to, and recover from incidents. Information sharing facilitates and supports all of these activities.\n(ii) The executive branch has for too long accepted antiquated and difficult-to-defend IT.\n(iii) Effective risk management involves more than just protecting IT and data currently in place. It also requires planning so that maintenance, improvements, and modernization occur in a coordinated way and with appropriate regularity.\n(iv) Known but unmitigated vulnerabilities are among the highest cybersecurity risks faced by executive departments and agencies (agencies). Known vulnerabilities include using operating systems or hardware beyond the vendor's support lifecycle, declining to implement a vendor's security patch, or failing to execute security-specific configuration guidance.\n(v) Effective risk management requires agency heads to lead integrated teams of senior executives with expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisition, law, privacy, and human resources.\n(c) Risk Management.\n(i) Agency heads will be held accountable by the President for implementing risk management measures commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of IT and data. They will also be held accountable by the President for ensuring that cybersecurity risk management processes are aligned with strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes, in accordance with chapter 35, subchapter II of title 44, United States Code.\n(ii) Effective immediately, each agency head shall use The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the Framework) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or any successor document, to manage the agency's cybersecurity risk. Each agency head shall provide a risk management report to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 90 days of the date of this order. The risk management report shall:\n(A) document the risk mitigation and acceptance choices made by each agency head as of the date of this order, including:\n(1) the strategic, operational, and budgetary considerations that informed those choices; and\n(2) any accepted risk, including from unmitigated vulnerabilities; and\n(B) describe the agency's action plan to implement the Framework.\n(iii) The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB, consistent with chapter 35, subchapter II of title 44, United States Code, shall jointly assess each agency's risk management report to determine whether the risk mitigation and acceptance choices set forth in the reports are appropriate and sufficient to manage the cybersecurity risk to the executive branch enterprise in the aggregate (the determination).\n(iv) The Director of OMB, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, with appropriate support from the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of General Services, and within 60 days of receipt of the agency risk management reports outlined in subsection (c)(ii) of this section, shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the following:\n(A) the determination; and\n(B) a plan to:\n(1) adequately protect the executive branch enterprise, should the determination identify insufficiencies;\n(2) address immediate unmet budgetary needs necessary to manage risk to the executive branch enterprise;\n(3) establish a regular process for reassessing and, if appropriate, reissuing the determination, and addressing future, recurring unmet budgetary needs necessary to manage risk to the executive branch enterprise;\n(4) clarify, reconcile, and reissue, as necessary and to the extent permitted by law, all policies, standards, and guidelines issued by any agency in furtherance of chapter 35, subchapter II of title 44, United States Code, and, as necessary and to the extent permitted by law, issue policies, standards, and guidelines in furtherance of this order; and\n(5) align these policies, standards, and guidelines with the Framework. (v) The agency risk management reports described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section and the determination and plan described in subsections (c)(iii) and (iv) of this section may be classified in full or in part, as appropriate.\n(vi) Effective immediately, it is the policy of the executive branch to build and maintain a modern, secure, and more resilient executive branch IT architecture.\n(A) Agency heads shall show preference in their procurement for shared IT services, to the extent permitted by law, including email, cloud, and cybersecurity services.\n(B) The Director of the American Technology Council shall coordinate a report to the President from the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate, regarding modernization of Federal IT.

Good afternoon. It's good to be back with you. Apparently I was a little missed.\nWe're one week out from the President's first foreign trip, so I wanted to make sure, as we prepare for that trip, that I bring out National Security Advisor, General McMaster, to give you a preview of what the team has been doing to prepare for the President's trip. Our goal is to kind of start that process now, and then next week bring the General back and give you a more detailed update as to what the President is going to be doing in each of the areas, and some of the highlights from the trip. We'll, obviously, additionally, have background briefings for you as well to give the team that's going to be traveling, the press corps, some logistical updates.\nSo without further ado, General McMaster.\nQ: Will you take questions after?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, Jeff, I will be glad to take your question. In fact, if you'd like, you get to go first today.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Thank you, Sean. Good afternoon, and Happy Mother's Day weekend, everybody. As you all know, in exactly one week the President will embark on his first trip abroad since taking office. Today I'd like to explain the President's objectives for his visits to the Middle East and to Europe, and also preview a bit of the schedule.\nThe trip has three core purposes. First, to reaffirm America's global leadership. Second, to continue building key relationships with world leaders. And, third, to broadcast a message of unity to America's friends and to the faithful of three of the world's greatest religions.\nThe President prioritizes building strong relationships, as you see here, every day with world leaders as a way to strengthen our alliances. And he's been successful. You can see that in his diplomacy with a range of leaders, from Prime Minister May to President Xi.\nPresident Trump understands that America First does not mean American alone -- to the contrary. Prioritizing American interests means strengthening alliances and partnerships that help us extend our influence and improve the security of the American people.\nThis trip is truly historic. No President has ever visited the homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslims faiths all on one trip. And what President Trump is seeking is to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity. He will bring a message of tolerance and of hope to billions, including to millions of Americans who profess these faiths. The President will focus on what unites us.\nThe President's trip will begin in Saudi Arabia, home to the two holiest sites in Islam. He will encourage our Arab and Muslim partners to take bold, new steps to promote peace and to confront those, from ISIS to al Qaeda to Iran to the Assad regime, who perpetuate chaos and violence that has inflicted so much suffering throughout the Muslim world and beyond.\nHe will lead the first steps toward a stronger, more capable, and more robust security partnership with our Gulf, Arab, and Muslim partners. And he will develop a strong, respectful message that the United States and the entire civilized world expects our Muslim allies to take a strong stand against radical Islamist ideology, an ideology that uses a perverted interpretation of religion to justify crimes against all humanity. He will call for Muslim leaders to promote a peaceful vision of Islam.\nThe President will then travel to Israel. With President Rivlin and Prime Minister Netanyahu, he will reaffirm America's unshakeable bond to the Jewish state. With President Abbas, he will express his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians. And so to leaders and peoples alike, across the entire trip, he will demonstrate his hopes for a just and lasting peace.\nIn Rome, the President will be honored to accept an audience with Pope Francis. He looks forward to paying his respects and to discussing religious freedom, ways to combat religious persecution, human trafficking, and cooperating on humanitarian missions across the globe.\nHe will also pay his respects to the Italian people by meeting with President Mattarella, the head of state and one of America's most important treaty allies and trading partners. He will also see again Prime Minister Gentiloni, who is hosting the G7 conference in Sicily.\nFrom Rome, the President will continue to Brussels for the NATO Leaders meeting. There, he will reaffirm America's commitment to the Alliance while stressing the need for members to pay their fair share, to shoulder responsibility, to share burdens, and for the institution to continue on the path of strengthening the Alliance.\nPresident Trump will end his trip in Sicily for the G7 meeting in Taormina, where he will promote American economic leadership and also address unfair trade practices. He will remind our friends and partners that we are eager to explore further ways to address threats to our mutual security, from North Korea to Afghanistan to the broader Middle East.\nBefore leaving, the President will visit Naval Air Station Sigonella, where he will thank our wonderful and courageous servicemen and women, ally personnel and family members for their sacrifices to keep us safe.\nAnd across the trip, he will meet our diplomats, the staff at our embassies who represent us so well across the world.\nLastly, just a few words on how this all came together. The impetus for this trip came from the President himself, and he has been fully engaged from the beginning -- setting objectives, overseeing the planning. The President is receiving regular briefings from his Cabinet and from our senior staff here on the national security side and on the economic side as well.\nMost of the leaders the President will meet on this trip, as you know, he's already met in person or certainly by phone. These relationships are off to a very strong start. And the trip is an opportunity to broaden and deepen those relationships. The administration continues to be in close contact and consultation with Congress, and we're drawing on the expertise across the Senate and the House in preparation for the trip, as well.\nAnd finally, this really is a team effort. The White House and National Security Council staff, the National Economic Council continue to work closely with our Departments of State, Treasury, Defense and others to fulfill the President's objectives and ensure smooth execution. On behalf of the President, I express the whole administration's thanks for all the hard work it takes to organize a trip of this scope and of this importance.\nSo the President and all of us are looking forward to the journey. And with that, I'll take a couple questions.\nQ: General McMaster, how is this President viewed among our Arab allies -- Saudi Arabia, UAE and others -- compared to his predecessor?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, I'll just say, the President's leadership has been welcomed -- welcomed enthusiastically. There was a perception that America had largely disengaged from the Middle East in particular, and that disengagement coincided with this humanitarian and political catastrophe in the region. And so now there's a broad recognition among all of our partners in the region that American leadership is necessary to help address this catastrophe and to begin to move the region toward the peace, security, and stability that the people there so deserve.\nAnd so what you're seeing, I think, is a galvanizing effect of the President's leadership in bringing those leaders together across the region, and bringing them together for a positive agenda -- who's against ending this catastrophe; who's against confronting these terrorists or the enemies of all civilized people; confronting Iran, who's participating in this cycle of violence; and to bring prosperity and peace to the region and the people who so richly deserve it.\nQ: You're somebody who is crucial, obviously, in the intelligence community, somebody who's leading the National Security Council. So I have to ask you: This week in particular there have been a lot of reports, including from our network, that intelligence officials are extremely concerned about how James Comey was fired. Do you believe that that threatens national security right now?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, I told Sean that I would pass all those questions to him, and he'll be happy to answer that after this --\nQ: But this is a national security question, sir.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: What I'd like to do is focus on the trip, and I'll come back next week with more details of the trip, as well.\nQ: You said the President was -- the impetus for the trip came from the President himself. Was it the President himself who decided to begin this trip in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam? And is there symbolic significance to that? And how many of our Muslim allies, how many countries, how many Muslim-majority countries will be represented at the meetings in Saudi Arabia?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, this was the President's initiative, to begin the trip in the Middle East, hosted by King Salman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And the King is going to bring together partners from across the region to meet with the President. So the answer to your question is -- and I can answer in more detail next week, because it's still coming in, the sort of final attendees, but he'll meet with a broad range of leaders in the Middle East, of course, many of whom -- most of whom he's met already here, or by phone certainly. And we have the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Zayed is coming, for example, on Monday as well.\nQ: General McMaster, at the beginning of this very long week, we were hearing speculation that the President was considering thousands more troops for Afghanistan. When he goes to Brussels on Thursday of next week, what is the message to the NATO partners with respect to their commitment in this long fight?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, the key is that all of us have to be committed to achieving our fundamental objectives in Afghanistan. Americans know really better than anybody because the mass murder against our own country on September 11, 2001 originated with a terrorist safe haven and support base in Afghanistan. Recently, we have been engaged against ISIS or ISIS Khorasan in Afghanistan with highly successful operations there that you'll hear more about in a press conference at the Department of Defense here in the near future.\nBut what has happened in Afghanistan is the Afghan army is taking the brunt of the fight against these transnational terrorists and the Taliban. And so we are working with our allies to figure out what more we can do to have a more effective strategy in Afghanistan, what are options we can bring to the President to be more effective in meeting our objectives in Afghanistan, and what more can we ask our allies to do which we're asking them now.\nSo this is going to be, really, consistent with the President's guidance to us.\nQ: Has the President decided that there should thousands more troops?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: The President has not made a decision yet on a course of action. What we have done, which is what we have done in many cases on the North Korea problem set, for example, is we've consulted broadly across our government and with allies. The President wants to hear from our allies, as well. This is a President who listens to his allies and partners. He'll have an opportunity to do so at the NATO Summit. He'll have an opportunity to do so at the G7. And so what we'll have at the end of the next few weeks here is an opportunity for a much more effective strategy for the problem set in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the region broadly.\nQ: General, if you could talk first about the evolution from the way the President campaigned, which was a more unilateral foreign policy, to this multilateral engagement that you're emphasizing and the way that you're rolling out this trip to explain that. And then, secondly, if you could also talk about the decision to send a delegation to the One Belt, One Road Forum in China, and what you hope to get out of that.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: So America First didn't mean America alone ever, I don't know. And so what we have done is advanced the President's agenda in national security by strengthening alliances by burden-sharing. Americans don't have to do everything, don't have to bankroll everything. And our allies and partners are grateful for, I think, the President's leadership in asking them to do more.\nSo it's an alliance in which each of the members are doing their fair share, who are shouldering the burden. Is it stronger or weaker? It's stronger. So the President has done a great deal to strengthen our alliances. And America First didn't mean America not leading. So for America to secure and advance its interests, that requires American leadership. And so the President's leadership has been welcomed in all the places that he'll be visiting on this trip, and his agenda I think that he laid out in the campaign is being operationalized and implemented by his Cabinet, primarily, with the assistance of our team here in the White House.\nQ: Two questions. First, there were reports out of Israel that President Trump may try to get Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas in the same room together while he's there. Is that, in fact, the case? And also, to NBC News yesterday, the President said that General Mattis and his other generals would be announcing something on ISIS next week. And so as one of the generals on his administration, can you talk to that? Is there an announcement coming next week?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: On the first part, it will be whatever the President wants to do. A lot of what we do in the National Security Council is try to keep up with the President. So you may have -- no, I think --\nQ: Are the plans -- have they tried to reach out to both of them to try to get them together?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: The final plans aren't set yet. We can comment maybe more about that next week. But it will obviously be up to the President and those leaders about how he wants to engage with them. But he'll engage with both those leaders there as part of the trip.\nIn terms of the campaign against transnational terrorist organizations and ISIS in particular, the President has asked us to do everything we can to defeat ISIS and, in particular, to ensure that we defeat ISIS in this so-called caliphate in the terrain that they're endeavoring to hold on to in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas.\nAnd what the President has also told us is he doesn't want to telegraph what he's doing tactically day to day. He wants the Department of Defense and our military commanders to be able to execute those campaigns consistent with his guidance, the policy and the strategy that he's approved.\nAnd so what we next will do will be an opportunity for our military leadership to lay out how they are executing the President's guidance, the progress they've made in the campaign, and what remains to be done. And so that's really the emphasis of the press conference next week.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, General.\nQ: Can we hear about Russia and the agreements that were made this week with Russia's top diplomat? I mean, you're going to the region to speak with Arab allies. How are you going to explain agreements you've made with Russia, allied with Iran, in Syria, a place that the President has said is now a priority for him?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I would characterize the engagements with Russian leadership by our Secretary of State, the brief meeting that the President had with Foreign Minister Lavrov, the phone conversations that we've had with Russian leadership as engagements, not decisions or specific approaches.\nI think what the President has made clear is that he will confront Russian disruptive behavior, such as its support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria, and its enabling of Iran and its very destructive policy and strategy that it's executing across the Middle East, what it's done and continue to do in Ukraine. He will confront that disruptive behavior.\nBut the President is looking for areas of cooperation. There are a lot of very significant security problem sets across the world. All of them would get easier, right, if Russia were to come to the conclusion that it could best advance its interests through cooperating with the United States and others to resolve those conflicts, rather than perpetuate them.\nQ: But aren't they party to those conflicts and causing them in Syria? I mean, the President said at the end of his meeting with Lavrov that it was really good, that there was -- he spoke in very positive terms that there was progress made. Are you saying there were no agreements?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: The President spoke in positive, affirmative, strong terms in his engagements with Russian leaders.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you very much.\nQ: A follow on --\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I'll take one more.\nQ: Can you tell us a little bit more about the America First policy, about how it changed over time? It's not been very clear what it means and how other people would want to sign up for it.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, what it means is that the President is prioritizing the security and interests of the American people. You can see that with what Secretary Ross has done in the economic relationship with China to look for ways to advance American prosperity.\nEvery theme of this trip is wholly consistent with the President's approach to prioritize the American people, American security, American jobs, American prosperity. And so you'll see that with I think almost a refreshing, I would say, integration of what we're doing in terms of security partnerships along with economic relationships, and the diplomatic engagement that the President's Cabinet has been engaged with since he's taken over as President. And this trip is going to be a tremendous way to solidify the gains already made and advance them further.\nMR. SPICER: All right. Thank you, General McMaster.\nI'm going to go through a couple updates and -- schedule before I get to your questions. And Jeff will get the first one.\nFirst off, Secretary Ross, I know, was up here last night to tell you about the developments -- and General McMaster just noted the developments that have happened and advances that have happened in trade. The 10 commitments that Secretary Ross announced yesterday are the initial results of the 100-day action plan of the United States-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, which began with President Trump and President Xi's meeting in Mar-a-Lago.\nUnder the leadership of Secretaries Ross, Mnuchin, and their Chinese counterparts, the United States has negotiated intensively to reach consensus in areas including agricultural trade, financial services, investment, and energy. One of the actions I want to point out in particular sets the stage for China to allow imports of American beef beginning no later than July 16th of this year.\nIt's been 13 years since our cattle producers have been able -- have been effectively locked out of the Chinese market. China is now second-largest beef importer in the world, buying roughly $2.6 billion dollars of beef every year. In a statement last night, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association –- the nation's largest association of cattle farmers -– said, and I quote, \"It's impossible to overstate how beneficial this will be for America's cattle producers, and [how] the Trump administration deserves a lot of credit for getting this achieved.\"\nThis announcement came on the same day that Secretary Perdue visited a large -- a barge loading facility in the Ohio River and announced that he will appoint an Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agriculture Affairs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This is further proof of the seriousness of which the administration is approaching the promotion of U.S. agricultural products abroad.\nAnd that's just one part of the deal that was reached. Here are some of the other highlights that we have worked with China. Eight pending biotech patents from the United States firms will be evaluated at a meeting of China's National Biosafety Committee by the end of May. We welcome China to receive imported liquefied natural gas, with companies allowed to proceed at any time to negotiate contracts.\nChina will allow foreign-owned financial services firms in China to provide credit rating services and credit investigations. By July 16th, China will issue further guidance to allow American-owned suppliers of electronic payment services to operate in China. And China will allow two American financial institutions to issue underwriting and settlement licenses no later than July 16th, as we continue to make progress within the 100-day framework, including discussion of a one-year plan to solidify action that will benefit both of our countries.\nMoving on, this morning, Attorney General Sessions issued a memo that restores flexibility to prosecutors so that they can most effectively combat the crisis of illegal drug trafficking that is polluting our cities and destroying our communities and families. This policy was formulated after extensive consultation with the prosecutors that handle these cases each and every day around the country. With these additional options available to them, they now have the leverage they need to get at the root of drug trafficking and the violent crime that surrounds it.\nAs the Attorney General said this morning, this will take the handcuffs off our nation's prosecutors, and, if I can add, it, frankly, puts the handcuffs on the drug traffickers who threaten the safety of our families and communities. The Trump administration is signaling to the worst of the worst -– the drug traffickers who violate our drug laws to move these dangerous substances around our border and into our communities -- that the United States Department of Justice will no longer look the other way.\nThis week, the administration has also been busy engaging with senators and their staff now that the American Health Care Act and the relief it promises for the American people is in the Senate's hands. I know Sarah talked to you yesterday about how Aetna has pulled out of Obamacare exchanges completely, leaving only one insurer in some of the markets. Another report out yesterday from eHealth showed that the average premiums for individual plans has spiked 39 percent since 2014. In some cases, insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses have become families' most significant expenses.\nWith each new report, it becomes clearer and clearer that we can't wait any longer to repeal and replace this failing system. Until we enact serious reforms of the healthcare system, the American people will continue to suffer under the consequences.\nTomorrow, the President will deliver his first commencement address in Lynchburg, Virginia at Liberty. He is greatly looking forward to visiting with Liberty's students and faculty who gave him such a warm welcome last year. He can be expected to note to the graduates his own change in status since they were last together.\nAs many of you know, Liberty is the largest Christian school in the nation and has, in recent years, made many remarkable strides in its -- strides forward in its academic, extracurricular, and athletic endeavors. Besides taking note of these achievements, the president will be congratulating the graduates on their accomplishments and encouraging them to be a force for good in the world by standing up for the values that Liberty has taught them. He will be offering congratulations, thanks and praise, and encouragement on a day of optimism and new beginnings for the graduates as well as the nation.\nIn terms of the rundown for next week, the President has a very packed schedule before we depart on his first foreign trip. On Monday, he's hosting the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates. On Tuesday, he will welcome the President of Turkey. On Wednesday, the President will travel to New London, Connecticut to deliver the commencement address at the United States Coast Guard Academy.\nOn Thursday, the President of Colombia will be at the White House for an official visit. And on Friday, we set off on the trip with the first stop being Saudi Arabia. And finally, in honor of Mother's Day, this afternoon the First Lady will host a reception in honor of military mothers in the residence, followed by a performance by the Army Chorus and Marine Band. The White House will issue a Mother's Day Proclamation later as well.\nAnd beyond all of the activity here, this is the official reminder to everyone to get your flowers and cards before it's too late.\nAnd with that, Jeff Mason.\nQ: Thank you for that reminder, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: You're welcome.\nQ: Moving on to the news of the week, really, and the day, did President Trump record his conversations with former FBI Director Comey?\nMR. SPICER: I assume you're referring to the tweet.\nQ: His tweet.\nMR. SPICER: And I've talked to the President. The President has nothing further to add on that.\nQ: Why did he say that? Why did he tweet that? What should we interpret from that?\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned, the President has nothing further to add on that.\nQ: Are there recording devices in the Oval Office or in the residence?\nMR. SPICER: As I've said for the third time, there is nothing further to add on that.\nQ: Does he think it's appropriate to threaten someone like Mr. Comey not to speak?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- that's not a threat. He simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself. I'm moving on.\nJohn.\nQ: If I could quote another one of the President's tweets this morning, he said \"Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat excuse for losing the election.\" What did the President mean by that? How specifically is the U.S. tearing itself apart over all of this?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's comments about Russia and collusion have been very clear with respect to some of the charges that have been made. He's been very clear that it's one thing that he believes that the -- that the notion that there's collusion is a hoax. It's been reaffirmed by several people, including Senator Grassley and others who have spoken to him, and -- that he wants to make sure that he's focused every day on doing what's best for the American people.\nQ: I understand all that, but -- you've said that many times. But how is the U.S. \"tearing itself apart\" over this?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think, obviously, this has been a subject that comes up over and over again when it's been very clearly stated on multiple occasions that there's no collusion that occurred, and yet this narrative continues to be perpetuated.\nQ: Do you think this is what the Russians wanted all along in interfering with the election?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I have no idea. But what I'm just telling you is I think we have made it clear at this podium several times, and I think the President made it clear, that -- what his feelings are on this.\nQ: Sean, in the dinner that the President had with James Comey earlier in January, did the President implore him to pledge his loyalty to the President? Is that true?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Did that happen? That did not happen?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: How important is it that the FBI director be loyal to the President? Is that a quality the President wants to see in anyone, particularly his FBI director?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President wants loyalty to this country and to the rule of law.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On the dinner with James Comey, does anyone in this White House have an audio recording of what unfolded during the January 27th dinner between the former FBI director and the President of the United States?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of that.\nQ: I have one follow-up question for you. What can the administration do better when it comes to communication? Today the President tweeted out that he felt from behind that podium it's not always possible to present the information with \"perfect accuracy.\"\nMR. SPICER: So look, I think we come out here every day and try to do the best job we can communicating what the President has done and the accomplishments he's making on the American people. We get here early, we work beyond being here at this podium. As many of you know, we get here early, we work pretty late. We do what we can.\nBut the President is an active President. He keeps a very robust schedule, as many of you are very well aware and as you can tell by the activities of next week alone. And I think sometimes we don't have an opportunity to get in to see him to get his full thinking. In those cases, we do our best to follow up with you. But I think that there are times when you, more than not, read a story where someone is trying pin -- trying to pull apart one word, one sentence and say, aha, and make it a \"gotcha\" thing.\nWe work very hard to get you the most accurate and up-to-date information throughout the day. We don't always have the opportunity to get in to see the President, and in those cases, I think we do a pretty good job of following up and getting you the information after the briefing, in a subsequent -- so that's exactly what he meant.\nQ: Is the President considering cancelling the daily press briefings?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's a little dismayed, as well as a lot of people, that we come out here and try to do everything we can to provide you and the American people with what he's doing on their behalf, what he's doing to keep the nation safe, what he's doing to grow jobs, and yet, we see time and time again an attempt to parse every little word and make it more of a game of \"gotcha\" as opposed to really figure out what the policies are, why something is being pursued or what the update is on this.\nAnd I think that's where there's a lot of dismay, and I don't think it's something that just alone the President feels.\nQ: Can I ask you one final logistical question?\nMR. SPICER: Sure, one final. It's Friday.\nQ: On the original question I had about the dinner on January 27th with James Comey, the President wasn't clear during the NBC interview who invited the FBI director to the White House at that time. How many invitations did the White House send to Director James Comey after January 20th and before the director was fired?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I'll try to get back to you.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I have a question about the Turkish President's visit next week. He recently called -- President Erdogan called for Muslims to rush the Temple Mount. Considering the President has said he's a mediator for peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis, what is his response to that? And then I have another question.\nMR. SPICER: So I think what you've seen with the President's meeting with these leaders is he engages privately in a lot of these things. And I think to a degree, a large degree, he's been able to achieve great success, whether Aya Hijazi in that particular case; working behind the scenes, whether it's the progress that he's made with China.\nThe President's behind-the-scenes diplomacy is paying dividends for the United States, and that's how he's going to continue to operate. And as General McMaster noted, it's that kind of diplomacy that's reasserting our position in the world and that trust, and those relationships continue to be built.\nQ: Are those comments helpful from the Turkish President?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a difference, Katie. If we can get out here and -- I think what the President believes is that behind-the-scenes diplomacy pays dividends in terms of affecting behavior and outcomes and furthering the goals of the United States. So that's as much as I want to say there.\nQ: My other question is, is the discussion about the refugee crisis, which is fueling problems in Europe -- the President has talked about refugees being a problem in the United States and terrorists hiding refugees -- or refugees hiding in the -- terrorists hiding in the refugee stream, excuse me. Is he going to talk about that with Arab leaders specifically when he visits Saudi Arabia? Or is that not something that he's willing to bring up to those leaders?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, he's talked about safe zones. He talked about it yesterday with the Foreign Minister -- or earlier this week, rather. He's brought it up on the calls.\nQ: But in Saudi Arabia specifically?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get ahead of his conversations that he's going to have, but I think the President has been very publicly clear about his desire to address that situation and some of the solutions that exist. But he's -- in a lot of the readouts, we've had that as part of it because he believes that that has to be part of a solution.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. In that interview that the President conducted yesterday with NBC, he indicated and confirmed that on three separate occasions he asked the director of the FBI, and received assurances from the FBI, that he was not under investigation by the FBI. Why was the President seemingly so consumed by this that he would ask that question on three separate occasions?\nMR. SPICER: I think because the narrative continues to be perpetuated, and he wanted clarity to make sure. But again, I haven't spoken to him on it about the reason, but I think he answered it yesterday very clearly. And so I can get back to you, but that's the answer.\nQ: I would appreciate you getting back to me. And as far as asking that question, did the President ask the White House Counsel whether it would be appropriate to ask such a question, given that it was against, generally, Justice Department guidelines to indicate whether or not investigations are ongoing against any individual, let alone one at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I will tell you that I know several legal scholars, including Alan Dershowitz and others, have said there was nothing inappropriate about that.\nDave.\nQ: Did the White House Counsel --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer.\nQ: Okay. Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: Dave.\nQ: General McMaster mentioned that, on the trip, the President is going to be raising the issue of religious persecution with the Pope. And I wanted to ask you about a case in the last week, in Indonesia, where a Christian governor in the state of Jakarta was imprisoned for two years for blaspheming the Quran. Does the President find that case troubling? Does he plan to say anything --\nMR. SPICER: Did John Gizzi give you this question?\nQ: I'm sorry. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: I don't have any updates on that particular case. I would ask you to check with the State Department.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I just want to clear up a point on Jeff's question. I'm hoping you can answer this in a yes-or-no fashion. Is the President of the United States currently recording conversations taking place in the Oval Office?\nMR. SPICER: I think the point that I made with respect to the tweet is the President has no further comment on this.\nQ: And I wanted to follow up. Since you were involved in this on Tuesday night as well, giving a blanket answer and saying at the time that it was all him regarding Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, why did you come out with information that was later contradicted by the President two days later? Can you explain the tick-tock? When were you brought in? Who else was involved? Why were the American people given incorrect information that night?\nMR. SPICER: I don't necessarily believe that that's true, Zeke. There was a decision-making process; the President explained it in the interview process.\nThe bottom line is that the director of the FBI serves at the pleasure of the President. The President made a decision to replace him, as he has stated very clearly now publicly. The President is now focused on making sure that he finds a replacement that has the leadership qualities to lead the FBI. That's it, plain and simple.\nQ: Sean, I wanted to follow up on that real briefly. What you said Tuesday doesn't match what the President was laying out yesterday, in the interview yesterday. Can you walk through why the discrepancy in terms of whose decision this was?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's always the President's decision. That's it. Final.\nQ: Okay, well, did he --\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned to Zeke, this is ultimately the President's -- always going to be the President's decision. Everyone who serves at the pleasure of the President, it's ultimately going to be his decision to hire someone, to fire someone. He made a decision in part based on the recommendation, and he's now focused on making sure that we have a replacement at the FBI to instill the proper leadership they need.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, let me ask you about the way forward as it relates to who the President might nominate to be the FBI director. Where does that process stand right now? How many people have been interviewed? Does the President hope to wrap this up before he goes overseas?\nMR. SPICER: On the timing, I think as soon as he finds a candidate that fits the qualities that he feels are necessary to lead the FBI, that's the timeline of that. I know that the Department of Justice has begun to create that list, and I believe they're going to, if they haven't already -- are going to be starting the process of interviewing people either today or through the weekend.\nBut, I mean, the President obviously wants to make sure that we've got the right person. And that process is being headed by the Department of Justice.\nQ: Sean, Sarah was talking the other day about how somebody, not necessarily being political in that role -- if somebody has been a member of Congress, past or present, does that count as an automatic disqualifier as somebody who might be --\nMR. SPICER: I have not asked the President, but I don't believe that he has stated any sort of in and out. The Department of Justice is screening candidates, and I'm sure that as they feel as though they've got a list of finalists, they'll share that with the President and he'll make a decision.\nQ: And lastly, does the President still have -- the other day someone asked, does the President have confidence in Andrew McCabe. After the testimony on Capitol Hill the other day, is that still the case? He is the acting director at this moment.\nMR. SPICER: I have not asked him about the deputy. I have not asked him about -- generally, I don't go through the list of government employees and ask him. So I have not asked him specifically about that.\nEamon.\nQ: Yesterday, Sarah told us that the President expects that the FBI investigation will be wrapped up with integrity -- that's what the White House wants. Today, the President tweeted and called it a \"witch hunt.\" How does tweeting and calling it a \"witch hunt\" help wrap that investigation up with integrity?\nMR. SPICER: The President -- no one wants this done -- he wants to know very clearly -- there's two pieces to this, right, which is what was Russia's involvement. And the President is obviously very concerned about any entities' attempts to influence the United States election. And that's one investigation.\nI think the second, this false narrative that we continue to fight every day that has been debunked by intelligence individuals, members of Congress who have been briefed over and over again -- that's where I think he's growingly concerned, as well as a number of American people who are growingly concerned that there is this perpetuated false narrative out there. That's, I think, the nut of this.\nQ: And secondly, I talked to a former FBI official today who said that the President's tweet, the implicit threat to former FBI Director James Comey, indicates that the President, in his words, is simply \"out of control.\" I'd like to get you to respond to that. Is he?\nMR. SPICER: That's, frankly, offensive.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions about the FBI director selection process. You said the names are coming from the Justice Department right now. Is the President consulting with Democratic congressional leaders, as well, or Republican congressional leaders on this? Or is he just getting names out of DOJ?\nMR. SPICER: That's a good question. I know that he was -- obviously he's going to take input from them. I don't know what specific conversations he's had, so I'd be glad to check on who he's spoken to or may be speaking to.\nAnita.\nQ: I had a --\nMR. SPICER: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had two.\nQ: -- follow-up question.\nMR. SPICER: I got confused that Dave stole one.\nQ: Now, I know that you said you're not disqualifying anyone on this. You also know there has been considerable mention in the last 24 hours of former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers as the new FBI director. Does the President have a meeting planned this weekend with Congressman Rogers?\nMR. SPICER: I am not aware of anything of that nature on his schedule, but we'll obviously -- as you know, we'll put out -- if there's a meeting, we'll put it out for you. Right now there is nothing that I'm aware of on the schedule, but generally we put out the next-day schedule later in the evening. And we will do that as well.\nKristen.\nQ: You already called on me.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry.\nQ: I had a couple questions about the President's remarks to NBC about General Flynn. He said that it wasn't an emergency, or he didn't think it was an emergency and that's why the firing, dismissal didn't happen right away. So I had a couple questions about that. Why didn't he think it was an emergency? And was it because of the messenger? Was it because information came from Sally Yates, who you called an opponent -- I think a political opponent of the President? Or is because Don McGahn downplayed the situation? Can you explain what he meant by that? And I have a follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: I can't specifically say what he meant by that, but what I can tell you is -- I mean, again, look at the timeline that happened. We went over this the other day, and this has been asked and answered multiple times. The former acting attorney general came and said, I want to give you a heads up on something. Don McGahn of the Counsel's Office informed the President. They asked for the documents or materials that she had referred to. It took, I forgot now, five or six days to get those. They reviewed them, and he was asked to resign shortly thereafter.\nBut I think that there is a difference. There wasn't a review process; that was the review process in this case. As the President noted yesterday during his interview, he had been thinking about this for a long time. The Justice Department had done a review.\nBut again, I'm not really sure -- in both cases --\nQ: (Inaudible) Comey? So then since you just --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, you just asked me what's --\nQ: I didn't ask about Justice, though. Is that what you're talking about?\nMR. SPICER: No, what I'm saying is you're asking why it wasn't an emergency. I think -- but it's not a question of is it an emergency. He took the time to do due process. If someone comes to you with an allegation, I think everyone deserves due process to make sure that that allegation -- someone coming in and giving you a heads up -- we did exactly what was necessary, and the President made the right decision. And he continues to stand by it.\nQ: Okay, so then two follow-ups. One, I'm still unclear, and you've mentioned this several times, why did it take so long for the White House to get those documents?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I think we've --\nQ: Is the White House asking? You couldn't go get the documents?\nMR. SPICER: Making it sound that is rather -- with all due respect, it's not how it works. They're the ones who possess the documents. They had them in their possession. I believe they asked for them, and it took a while.\nQ: Is it because she was fired, though, in between?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think part of it is just some of these things don't happen as easily in terms of where they're -- I don't know the answer. But I think that in the course of action, if you look at the intervening days, that's a question that you should ask the Department of Justice.\nQ: Okay, and then I just had a follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: Just explain to us then a little bit, when you compare these two situations with General Flynn and Director Comey, the memo came one day and he was fired that day. That was the review process. And General Flynn was 18 days. That's a huge difference. Why was one so fast when one was 18 days?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think to -- first of all, they both had a review. They both came and the President looked at the information in the reviews and made a decision. Ultimately, as I mentioned, that's his job. He's the decider. He felt as though he had the information necessary in both cases to act, and he did.\nVivian.\nQ: Sean, in the tweet about Director Comey, he said -- the President says that he \"better be careful before he goes leaking to the press.\" Yesterday, on NBC News, the President called him a showboat and a grandstander. Does the White House acknowledge that Director Comey has a First Amendment right to speak to the press if he so chooses to set the record straight about any of this, instead of just leaking? It may not be leaking, it may just be his First Amendment right to speak to the press.\nMR. SPICER: Well, of course, everyone in this country has a First Amendment right. I think the difference -- and you've heard the President echo this multiple times -- is that sharing information that's not meant to be or is not authorized to be in the public domain in terms of the classification of it is concerning. And I think the President has been very clear over and over again of his concern with respect to information that gets put in the public domain that's not meant to be.\nBut I don't think that those are -- everyone in this country has every right to speak their mind and express themselves in accordance with the Constitution.\nQ: Okay, and a follow-up. Just in terms of the FBI being in disarray, also the President's comments, is he concerned that if he continues like this it could jeopardize morale at the FBI instead of actually kind of correcting a problem that he obviously observes there?\nMR. SPICER: I think that one of the reasons that he wants to go through the process of finding an individual who can lead the FBI and the men and women who serve there so bravely and ably is to make sure that morale and the focus is as it's supposed to be, and that you have a leader that can do that.\nAnd as he's mentioned, it's the crown jewel of law enforcement. And I think the reason that he wants to go through this process and choose a leader that can restore leadership, ensure that morale stays where it needs to be, and that there's a focus. That's why he's conducting the process that he has.\nJessica.\nQ: Can I give my question to Kristen, and then take the question back?\nMR. SPICER: What's that?\nQ: You called on her first, so I just wanted to give her the question that you had promised her before, and then I'll pick up from there.\nQ: Thank you. And I'll owe you a question. Thank you. I just want to ask --\nMR. SPICER: Courtesy exchange back there with questions.\nQ: I want to ask you -- President Trump seemed to rely on James Clapper this morning when he tweeted that virtually he and everyone else with knowledge of the \"witch hunt\" says there's no collusion. James Clapper himself today told Andrea Mitchell, \"I don't know if there was collusion or not. I don't know if there's evidence of collusion or not, nor should I.\" On March 5th on \"Meet the Press,\" when he was asked a similar question, he said, \"Not to my knowledge.\" So can you describe the discrepancy and explain it?\nMR. SPICER: No. I actually think that that's a great question that you should ask Director Clapper. I think --\nQ: No, between Director Clapper's comments and President Trump -- why is he leaning on Clapper when he said \"I have no knowledge\" of whether there was collusion?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think on several occasions Director Clapper has said that he has no knowledge of any collusion. That's it. I mean, that's the point that --\nQ: He said he hasn't been briefed. He said he wouldn't know because he hasn't been briefed on the investigation.\nMR. SPICER: He was DNI up until January 20th.\nQ: He was very clear today that -- he said, \"Nor should I have in this particular context.\" He made the case that he's not briefed on an FBI investigation, that that's not his purview.\nMR. SPICER: Fair enough. He's the Director of National Intelligence. On multiple occasions prior to today, he made it very clear that he was unaware of any collusion.\nQ: But at one point was -- he wouldn't know, right? That there has been no final conclusion. And the President seemed to indicate that there was --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, but then -- so the question that I would ask then, Kristen, is then why did he say what he said before? It seems -- his testimony and comments on multiple occasions prior to today was, I have no evidence that there was any collusion, right? So to suddenly today shift his story, I believe that the question should be asked to him: You were the Director of National Intelligence, you said multiple times, including in testimony in front of Congress, under oath, that there was no collusion.\nI believe that that's a question for him.\nQ: The President doesn't believe that there's been a final conclusion made about this investigation, right? There's an ongoing investigation. He's not making that argument, is he?\nMR. SPICER: But my point is, is that all we're able to do at this point is that the people who are aware of the former Director of National Intelligence, the head of the nation's agencies -- intelligence agencies -- makes multiple statements, as others -- Senator Grassley and others -- talking about the involvement and making it very clear that there was none. We took them at their word then and we continue to believe --\nQ: His argument is he wants to move forward with the investigation. But I want to move on to just one other question.\nMR. SPICER: Well, then, that -- again, I think that -- but the question, Kristen, before you move on, is, then why did he make the statements that he did when he did? To turn around now months later and say, well, even though I made those comments on multiple occasions, I wasn't briefed?\nQ: But the comments are not mutually exclusive, Sean. He's saying he wasn't -- (inaudible) -- it's not surprising or abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation or the context of the investigation.\nMR. SPICER: It sounds like the story is changing. Right, okay. Well, ultimately, there's been several --\nQ: Let's talk very quickly about the accuracy tweet.\nMR. SPICER: Well, do you mind if I -- I think in this case it is interesting how the story has changed. He made those comments several times over several courses of action. And to say that the Director of National Intelligence, who stated unequivocally what his position was on multiple occasions before today, and now suddenly is saying, I wasn't sure about it -- the burden seems to be on him, not us.\nQ: He wasn't saying he wasn't sure. He said he wasn't briefed. But moving on to the accuracy tweet.\nMR. SPICER: You should apply for, like, a Clapper spokesman job or something.\nQ: No, but I just am interested in the discrepancy and drawing a final conclusion on the part of the President.\nMR. SPICER: I think that that's a great thing to ask him.\nQ: No, on the part of the President, drawing a final conclusion about the investigation. In terms of the accuracy tweet, should we take that tweet to mean that you don't have the full picture when you stand at that podium?\nMR. SPICER: As I said, we come up here every day, not just to the podium, but we are here first thing in the morning until late at night every day answering your questions on a variety of subjects and throughout issues that are happening in the government.\nWe, as most of you can attest, work day and night to make sure that we get you the most up-to-date, accurate information at all times. With respect to the President, as I mentioned, he's an active President. He keeps an unbelievably busy and robust schedule. And there are times when we give you the information that we have at the time and we seek to get an update. And I believe that you and others will attest to, when we don't have an answer, we try really hard to either update you after the fact or to get you the facts that we didn't have at the time.\nBut we work really hard every day to do that. And I think the President's point that I pointed out earlier is that there are times when we're asked a question, we do our best to give you the answer, and every word is picked apart to try to figure out how to make an issue out of it as opposed to allowing us to talk to the President, get his current thinking and updates if we hadn't had an opportunity to do that at this time.\nJennifer.\nQ: Can I -- Sean, can I actually pick up there if you don't mind?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, Jessica then -- so we'll do the Js.\nQ: So I wanted to ask you about the One Belt, One Road Summit that starts on Sunday in China. You announced yesterday, or Secretary Ross did, that you're going to send a delegation to that summit. Can you talk about how you came to that conclusion, why it's important for the U.S. to be represented at what's ostensibly a major trade initiative by a foreign country?\nMR. SPICER: As you point, it's a major trade initiative. There's a lot of ports and infrastructure that they're looking to do through those discussions -- that Secretary Ross and Secretary Mnuchin and others had at Mar-a-Lago. And part of this is that that is something they've done. We're going to continue to work with them. Obviously, trade is a major issue for us. And what they're looking to do is of great importance to our economic and national security. And they've asked us to send people to that. And we have them attend things that we're doing as well.\nAnd I think that's -- as the President has shown in terms of the relationship that he's built with President Xi and the rest of the team built with their delegation, those relationships are clearly paying dividends, both on the national security front and on the economic front.\nJennifer.\nQ: Is the intended signal that the U.S. is going to participate in the One Belt, One Road initiative?\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll have a readout. At this point, that's all we have on One Belt, One Road.\nQ: Two questions -- the first on loyalty and the next one on the visit to the FBI headquarters. So this President does value loyalty. Was there any sort of -- before you were hired, any sort of request or hint that you pledge personal loyalty to him at all before you were hired?\nMR. SPICER: No. I've pledged my loyalty to the Constitution and to the American people, as has everyone who serves in our government and this administration, and we stand by that.\nQ: Is it true that the President was warned that he might not be well-received at the FBI headquarters if he were to visit it?\nMR. SPICER: I don't, not that I'm aware of. Thank you guys. Have a great weekend. We'll see you on Monday. Thank you.\nEND 2:14 P.M.

Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly 10 years last month, and we created 211,000 new jobs.\nOur economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans who, at this time of the year, are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma, certificate, or commission. So important, and we're so proud of them.\nThis weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates. I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G-7—and I look forward to that—and will be at West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy.\nCome to think about it, a few days later, I'll actually travel to New London, Connecticut, to speak to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country. So we'll be with them very shortly.\nTo young Americans at both schools, I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our Nation's bright future. That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force.\nWe are also celebrating all of the Americans who learn the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build, shape, and supply this Nation. The people who construct, repair, and create with their own two hands are the people who make this Nation run. And lots of those people voted for me. That's also why, in my administration, I'm so deeply committed to technical and vocational education.\nI want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs. We are ending the sellout of American workers and lifting the burdens on American industry, manufacturing, and business.\nWe're also rolling back the job-killing regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America. At the same time, we are unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil and just off our shores. On trade, we have also taken historic action to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of high-paying jobs that can support a middle class family and, in fact, most families.\nAs a vote of confidence in these policies, business optimism is soaring, and employment is rising. These are great signs for America's future, the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country. I want every young citizen, regardless of education or geography, to be able to live out their American dreams.\nSo to all of America's graduates, congratulations. And to all of America's youth: We are here to help create the jobs and future you deserve.\nThe brightest days are ahead of you. And I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy and at Liberty University.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan first recognized this day with a proclamation, honoring the exemplary service and immeasurable sacrifices of our Nation's military spouses. This long overdue tribute gives thanks to those who, since the formation of our Republic, have served our country with selfless support. Military spouses have been, and continue to be, a steady, strong presence on the home front and in the hearts of our military men and women.\nMost military spouses hold no rank and wear no uniform, yet humbly serve our Nation with distinction. They endure deployments for weeks, months, and years at a time, sometimes with little warning, and they must brace themselves for the uncertainty that comes with goodbye. When duty calls, they shoulder the full day-to-day responsibilities of managing a household and often of parenting—many times with little or no support. They face frequent relocations, which interrupt their careers and educational pursuits and require them to leave churches, homes, and friends. Most difficult of all, military spouses live with constant worry about the daily risks our military forces take for our country. Military spouses navigate these and other challenges with uncommon grace and inspiring strength.\nMy Administration will focus on supporting and increasing opportunities for military spouses. I urge American businesses to create opportunities for hiring, training, and promoting military spouses, and to identify ways to keep them employed following relocations. These women and men have skills and experiences valued by employers and coworkers alike. They give so much of themselves to our country, and they deserve our enduring respect and appreciation in return. I have pledged to our Armed Forces to have their backs, and that means providing for our military spouses as well.\nOn this Military Spouse Day, we recognize the exceptional women and men who have shared their loved ones with our country. We honor them for their service, praise them for their sacrifices, and offer them our gratitude and prayers on behalf of a grateful Nation.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 12, 2017, as Military Spouse Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

It is an occasion to thank our mothers for the life and love they have given us and to emphasize our affection for them, affection they deserve every day of the year. But it is also an opportunity to honor mothers across our Nation and celebrate motherhood as a pillar of our country's stability and success.\nOur deep appreciation for the strength and spirit of mothers and their resolve to do what is right for their children and families cannot be overstated. They are often the first to lend a hand during hard times and the first to celebrate our proudest victories. The boundless energy of our mothers inspires us to be people of action, people who strive relentlessly toward our goals. Above all, they teach us the power and joy of unconditional love.\nToday and every day, we honor the incredible women whose influence on the world is beyond measure. They brighten America's future by shaping the character of each new generation. They lead us through our deepest lessons about perseverance and hard work, preparing us for life's responsibilities. Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, our Nation's mothers give selflessly of themselves for the well-being of the lives and futures of others. We humbly thank them for this greatest gift.\nIn recognition of the contributions of mothers to American families and to our Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 14, 2017, as Mother's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their love and respect for their mothers or beloved mother figures, whether with us in person or in spirit, and to reflect on the importance of motherhood to the prosperity of our families, communities, and Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

These critical systems connect Americans to one another, provide vital national security capabilities, and serve as a cornerstone of our economy. We also recognize the transportation professionals who are dedicated to keeping our Nation's transportation networks secure, efficient, and reliable.\nQuality infrastructure provides Americans with the freedom they need and deserve to move themselves and their families, and the vast array of products they want to buy and sell. But in too many cases, our roads, waterways, bridges, airports, and mass transit systems have fallen into disrepair. That is why my Administration is committed to rebuilding a world-class transportation infrastructure that works for all Americans.\nRevitalizing our infrastructure is all the more important because American transportation enhancements have played and will continue to play a critical role in our national defense. During World War II, our ability to refuel ships at sea was, in the words of Admiral Chester Nimitz, the \"Navy's secret weapon.\" Today, our military logistics system is essential to the defense of our homeland and our ability to project power around the world.\nTo remain effective, the transportation industry must constantly innovate. That is why, in addition to rebuilding our current infrastructure, my Administration is removing regulatory hurdles that have, for too long, impeded necessary infrastructure improvements. This will allow creative companies to transform how we use our roads, waterways, rails, and the skies, making them both safer for travelers and more effective for our national security.\nTo recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), has designated the third Friday in May of each year as \"National Defense Transportation Day,\" and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), has declared that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as \"National Transportation Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

And congratulations to the class of 2017. That's some achievement.\nThis is your day and you've earned every minute of it. And I'm thrilled to be back at Liberty University, I've been here, this is now my third time, and we love setting records, right. We always set records. We have to set records, we have no choice.\nIt's been a little over a year since I've spoken on your beautiful campus and so much has changed. Right here, the class of 2017 dressed in cap and gown, graduating to a totally brilliant future. And here I am standing before you as President of the United States, so I'm guessing — there are some people here today who thought that either one of those things, either one, would really require major help from God. Do we agree? And we got it.\nBut here we are celebrating together on this very joyous occasion, and there is no place in the world I'd rather be to give my first commencement address as President than here with my wonderful friends at Liberty University. And I accepted this invitation a long time ago. I said to Jerry that I'd be there, and when I say something I mean it.\nI want to thank President Jerry Falwell and his incredible wife, Becky, stand up, Becky, for their kind words, their steadfast support, and their really wonderful friendship. Let me also extend our appreciation to the entire Falwell family, Trey, Sarah, Wesley, Laura, and Caroline, thank you for everything you do to make this university so exceptional, one of the truly great, great schools.\nMost importantly to our new graduates: Each of you should take immense pride in what you have achieved. There's another group of amazing people we want to celebrate today and they are the ones who have made this journey possible for you, and you know who that is? Nobody, you forgot already. You're going to go out, you're going to do whatever you're going to do, some are going to make a lot of money, some are going to be even happier doing other things — they're your parents and your grandparents, don't forget them. You haven't forgotten yet, have you? Never, ever forget them, they're great.\nAnd especially this weekend, let's make sure we give a really extra special thanks to the moms. Don't forget our moms, because graduates, today is your day. Today is your day. But in all of this excitement don't forget that tomorrow is Mother's Day, right? I had a great mother, she's looking down, now but I had a great mother. I always loved Mother's Day.\nWe're also deeply honored to be joined by some of the nearly 6000 service members, military veterans and military spouses who are receiving their diplomas today. Will you please stand. Please stand. Wow. That's great. Thank you very much, great job. We're profoundly grateful to every single one of you who sacrificed to keep us safe and protect God's precious gift of freedom. It is truly a testament to this university and to the values that you embrace that your graduating class includes so many patriots who have served our country in uniform. Thank you very much.\nTo the class of 2017: Today you end one chapter but you are about to begin the greatest adventure of your life. Just think for a moment of how blessed you are to be here today at this great, great university, living in this amazing country, surrounded by people who you love and care about so much. Then ask yourself, with all of those blessings, and all of the blessings that you've been given, what will you give back to this country and, indeed, to the world? What imprint will you leave in the sands of history? What will future Americans say we did in our brief time right here on Earth? Did we take risks? Did we dare to defy expectations? Did we challenge accepted wisdom and take on established systems? I think I did, but we all did and we're all doing it.\nOr did we just go along with convention, swim downstream, so easily with the current and just give in because it was the easy way, it was the traditional way or it was the accepted way? Remember this, nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage to do what is right — and they know what is right, but they don't have the courage or the guts or the stamina to take it and to do it. It's called the road less traveled.\nI know that each of you will be a warrior for the truth, will be a warrior for our country, and for your family. I know that each of you will do what is right, not what is the easy way, and that you will be true to yourself, and your country, and your beliefs. In my short time in Washington I've seen firsthand how the system is broken. A small group of failed voices who think they know everything and understand everyone want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think. But you aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you're right. And those of you graduating here today, who have given half a million hours of charity last year alone, unbelievable amount of work and charity and few universities or colleges can claim anything even close, we don't need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives. I'm standing here looking at the next generation of American leaders. There may very well be a president or two in our midst. Anybody think they're going to be president, raise your hand.\nIn your hearts are inscribed the values of service, sacrifice and devotion. Now you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action. America has always been the land of dreams because America is a nation of true believers. When the pilgrims landed at Plymouth they prayed. When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence, they invoked our creator four times, because in America we don't worship government we worship God. That is why our elected officials put their hands on the Bible and say, 'So help me God,' as they take the oath of office. It is why our currency proudly declares, 'In God we trust,' and it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under God every time we say the pledge of allegiance.\nThe story of America is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith, big dreams and humble beginnings. That is also the story of Liberty University. When I think about the visionary founder of this great institution, Reverend Jerry Falwell Sr., I can only imagine how excited he would be if he could see all of this and all of you today, and how proud he would be of his son and of his family.\nIn just two days we will mark the 10th anniversary of Reverend Falwell's passing, and I used to love watching him on television, hearing him preach, he was a very special man. He would be so proud not just at what you've achieved but of the young men and women of character that you've all become. And Jerry, I know your dad is looking down on you right now and he is proud, he is very proud, so congratulations on a great job Jerry. Reverend Falwell's life is a testament to the power of faith to change the world. The inspiring legacy that we see all around us in this great stadium — this is a beautiful stadium and it is packed. I'm so happy about that. I said, 'How are you going to fill up a place like that?' It is packed, Jerry.\nIn this beautiful campus and in your smiling faces but it all began with a vision. That vision was of a world class university for evangelical Christians. And I want to thank you, because boy did you come out and vote, those of you that are old enough, in other words your parents. Boy oh boy, you voted, you voted.\nNo doubt many people told him his vision was impossible, and I am sure they continued to say that so long after he started, at the beginning with just 154 students, but the fact is no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can't be done. Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they're people that can't get the job done. But the future belongs to the dreamers, not to the critics. the future belongs to the people who follow their heart no matter what the critics say because they truly believe in their vision.\nAt Liberty your leaders knew from the very beginning that a strong athletic program would help this campus grow so that this school might transform more lives. That is why a crucial part of Reverend Falwell's vision for making Liberty a world-class institution was having a world-class football team much like the great teams of Notre Dame, great school, great place, in fact, Vice President Mike Pence is there today doing a fabulous job as he always does.\nA few years ago, the New York Times even wrote a story on the great ambitions of the Liberty Flames. That story prompted a longtime president of another school to write a letter to Jerry. It's a letter that Reverend Falwell would have been very, very pleased to read. Jerry tells me that letter now hangs in the wall in the boardroom of your great university. It came from the late Father Theodore Hesper, who was the beloved president of the university of Notre Dame 35 years ago. Like this school's founder, he was a truly kindhearted man of very, very deep faith. In the letter, Father Hesper recalled that Notre Dame's own meteoric rise from a small Midwestern school to a national football powerhouse. And then he wrote something so amazing and generous. He wrote, 'I think you are on that same trajectory now and I want to wish you all the best and encourage you from the starting and from being able to start very small and arriving in the big time.'\nThanks to hard work, great faith, and incredible devotion those dreams have come true. As of February of this year, the Liberty Flames are playing in the FBS, the highest level of competition in NCAA football. Don't, don't clap, that could be tough. Don't clap. That could be tough. I'm a little worried. I don't want to look at some of those scores here. Jerry, you sure you know what you're doing here? Those other players are big and fast and strong but I have a feeling you're going to do very well, right?\nFrom the most humble roots you've become a powerhouse in both education and sports. And just wait until the world hears the football teams you'll be playing on your schedule starting next season. President Falwell gave me a list of some of those schools, the ones you're going to be playing 2018. Would you like me to read the names? Just came out, would you like to hear them? I'm a little bit concerned. UMass, Virginia, Auburn — Jerry, are you sure you know what you're doing? Jerry, Auburn? I don't know about that James. This could be trouble, Jerry. Rutgers, Old Dominion, Brigham Young, Army — I might be at that game, who am I supposed to root for? Tell me. I don't know. That's a tough one, Jerry. I don't know, Jerry, I'm going to have to think about that one, Jerry. Buffalo, Troy, Virginia Tech, oh no, Jerry, Ole Miss and wake forest, those are really top schools. maybe in four or five years I'll come to a game, right, you'll build it up. Well good luck.\nThe success of your athletic program arriving on the big stage should be a reminder to every new graduate of just what you can achieve when you start small, pursue a big vision and never, ever quit. You never quit. If I give you one message to hold in your hearts today, it's this. Never, ever give up. There will be times in your life you'll want to quit, you'll want to go home, you'll want to go home perhaps to that wonderful mother that's sitting back there watching you and say, 'Mom, I can't do it. I can't do it.' Just never quit. Go back home and tell mom, dad, I can do it, I can do it. I will do it, you're going to be successful. I've seen so many brilliant people, they gave up in life, they were totally brilliant, they were top of their class, they were the best students, they were the best of everything, they gave up. I've seen others who really didn't have that talent or that ability and they're among the most successful people today in the world because they never quit and they never gave up. So just remember that. Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you.\nCarry yourself with dignity and pride. Demand the best from yourself and be totally unafraid to challenge entrenched interests and failed power structures. Does that sound familiar by the way? The more people tell you it's not possible, that it can't be done, the more you should be absolutely determined to prove them wrong. Treat the word 'impossible' as nothing more than motivation. Relish the opportunity to be an outsider. Embrace that label — being an outsider is fine, embrace the label — because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference. The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead, you must keep pushing forward.\nAnd always have the courage to be yourself. Most importantly, you have to do what you love. You have to do what you love. I've seen so many people, they're forced through lost of reasons, sometimes including family, to go down a path that they don't want to go down, to go down a path that leads them to something that they don't love, that they don't enjoy. You have to do what you love, or you most likely won't be very successful at it. So do what you love.\nI want to recognize a friend who is here with us today, who can serve as an inspiration to us all. Someone who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit'. Real champion. A true, true champion. Both on the field, off the field, he's a Hall of Fame quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, really a good friend of mine, an amazing guy, Jim Kelly, where is Jim, he's here some place. Where is Jim, stand up, Jim. What a great man. Jim Kelly, he was tough. Jim do you have any idea how much money you'd be making today? They'd hit Jim, it was like tackling a linebacker. They'd hit Jim, four guy, five guys that weighed 320, and he'd just keep going down the field. He was much more than a quarterback. He had tremendous heart and he knew how to win. Jim is tough, and his toughest fight of all was that he beat cancer not once but twice.\nAnd I saw him and his incredible wife as they were in a very low moment, Jill, very, very low moment, and it was amazing the way they fought. It didn't look good, I would have said, maybe, maybe it's not going to happen. But there was always that hope because of Jim and Jim's heart. But I want to just say it's great to have you here today Jim and these people are big, big fans and if you can get a young version of Jim Kelly, you'll be beating a lot of teams, Jerry.\nSo, interestingly, though, I said 'I wonder what Jim's doing here,' his daughter Erin crosses the goal line to you and today with you so, Erin, stand up. Where are you, Erin? Where is Erin? Congratulations, Erin. Congratulations. Graduating from Liberty. Great choice, thank you.\nLiberty University is a place where they really have true champions and you have a simple creed that you live by: To be, really, champions for Christ. Whether you're called to be a missionary overseas, to shepherd a church or to be a leader in your community, you are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope and love. And I must tell you I am so proud as your president to have helped you along over the past short period of time. I said I was going to do it, and Jerry, I did it. And a lot of people are very happy with what's taken place, especially last week, we did some very important signings, right James? Very important signings.\nAmerica is better when people put their faith into action. As long as I am your president, no one is ever going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what's in your heart.\nWe will always stand up for the right of all Americans to pray to God and to follow his teachings. America is beginning a new chapter. Today each of you begins a new chapter as well. When your story goes from here, it will be defined by your vision, your perseverance and your grit. That's a word Jim Kelly knows very well, your grit. In this, I'm reminded of another man you know very well and who has joined us here today. His name is George Rogers, Liberty University CFO and vice president for a quarter of a century. During World War II, George spent three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war. He saw many of his fellow soldiers die during the Bataan death march. He was the victim of starvation and torture as a prisoner of war. When he was finally set free he weighed just 85 pounds and was told he would not live past the age of 40. Today George is 98 years old.\nGreat. That's so great, George. If anyone ever had reason to quit, to give in to the bitterness and anger that we all face at some point, to lose hope in God's vision for his life, it was indeed George Rogers. But that's not what he did. He stood up for his country, he stood up for his community. He stood up for his family and he defended civilization against a tide of barbarity, the kind of barbarity we're seeing today and we've been witnessing over the last number of years and I just want to tell you as your president, we are doing very, very well in countering it, so you just hang in there. Things are going along very, very well. You'll be hearing a lot about it next week from our generals Things are going along very, very well.\nThrough it all, he kept his faith in God, even in the darkest depths of despair. Like so many others of his generation, George came home to a nation full of optimism and pride and began to live out the American dream. He started a family, he discovered God's plan for him and pursued that vision with all his might, pouring his passion into a tiny college in a place called Lynchburg, Virginia. Did you ever hear of that? Lynchburg? We love, we love it. Do you like it? We like it, right? I flew over it a little while ago. It's amazing, actually. What started as a dream with a few good friends he helped shepherd into the largest Christian university in the world. Just look at this amazing, soaring, growing campus and I've been watching it grow because I've been a friend of Liberty for a long time, now, Jerry. It's been a long time.\nThanks in great part George's financial stewardship hundreds of thousands of young hearts and souls have been enriched at Liberty and inspired by the spirit of God. George, we thank you, and we salute you, and you just stay healthy for a long time, George, thank you.\nNow it falls on the shoulders of each of you here today to protect the freedom that patriots like George earned with their incredible sacrifice. Fortunately you have been equipped with the tools from your time right here on this campus to make the right decisions and to serve God, family and country. As you build good lives, you will also be rebuilding our nation. You'll be leaders in your communities, stewards of great institutions and defenders of liberty and you will be great mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers, loving friends and loving family members. You will build a future where we have the courage to chase our dreams no matter what the cynics and the doubters have to say. You will have the confidence to speak the hopes in your hearts and to express the love that stirs your souls. And you will have the faith to replace a broken establishment with a government that serves and protects the people.\nWe must always remember that we share one home and one glorious destiny whether we are brown, black or white. We all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same great American flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. As long as you remember what you have learned here at Liberty, as long as you have pride in your beliefs, courage in your convictions and faith in your God, then you will not fail.\nAnd as long as America remains true to its values, loyal to its citizens, and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come, I can promise you that. This has been an exceptional morning. It's been a great honor for me and I want to thank you, the students. I also want to thank you, the family, for getting them there, and I want to thank and congratulate Liberty. May God bless the class of 2017. May god bless the United States of America. May God bless all of you here today. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-05-13", "title": "Commencement Address at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia"}

The number of women dying from heart disease and cancer—the top two killers of women in America—has been decreasing for decades. Thanks to new breast cancer treatments, our health care professionals have saved lives and improved the quality of life for millions of women. We must continue to foster an environment that rewards these needed advances in research.\nEnsuring affordable, accessible, and quality healthcare is critical to improving women's health and ensuring that it fits their priorities at any stage of life. In particular, women should have access to quality prenatal, maternal, and newborn care. Under the current healthcare system, however, the lack of choice in health insurance and in healthcare providers, along with skyrocketing premium and out-of-pocket costs, are failing our citizens, our families, and, in particular, our women. Studies show that women are often the primary healthcare decision-maker for their family and they deserve better options.\nI am committed to working with Congress to help mothers—and fathers—have paid family leave so that childcare is accessible and affordable, and to invest in the comprehensive care that women receive at community health centers. Through these reforms, and my 2018 Presidential Budget, we will enable access to the critical healthcare services women need.\nSincerely,\nDONALD J.

And to all of our honored guests, good afternoon.\nOn behalf of the President of the United States, today it will be my great privilege to administer the oath of office to the 18th United States Trade Representative -- Robert Lighthizer. (Applause.)\nAnd with this ceremony, President Donald Trump's Cabinet is finally complete. (Applause.)\nThis is a special occasion. It's an honor to have with us a couple of the people very special to Bob Lighthizer and very special to the American people.\nFirst off, join me in welcoming his daughter Claire, his son Bob, Jr. (Applause.) And Bob, Jr. has his family with us, as well, including two of his dad's grandchildren. Penelope and Emmet are with us today. Thank you so much for coming. (Applause.)\nI am grateful to be joined by a friend and a colleague of so many years of our new U.S. Trade Representative, Senator Pat Roberts. Thank you for your great leadership for the people of Kansas. And I must tell you -- though I could tell by the response of this crowd just a few moments ago -- it is always an honor to be with Senator Bob Dole, one of the greatest Americans of the last century. (Applause.)\nTo hear Bob Lighthizer tell it, he learned everything that he knows from Bob Dole, serving with him for nearly a decade and a half in his Senate office. And, Senator, it's great to see you here, and we're honored by your presence.\nPresident Donald Trump made a promise to the American people -- to fight for trade that puts America first. And in choosing Robert Lighthizer as the U.S. Trade Representative, President Trump is keeping his promise to put America first. (Applause.)\nRobert Lighthizer is uniquely qualified for this vital role because he's frankly one of the leading experts on trade in all of America.\nBob's distinguished career stretches back to the 1970s. He worked as a lawyer in private practice before joining the Senate Committee on Finance, where he eventually rose to serve as chief counsel and staff director.\nAs his reputation grew, President Ronald Reagan took notice. In 1983, the President named him as the deputy U.S. trade representative. In this capacity, he directly contributed to the renewed growth and prosperity of that era by negotiating more than two dozen bilateral trade agreements with nations all across the wider world.\nFor the past 30 years, Robert has represented the American businesses that are the beating heart of our economy as a trade litigator. From manufacturing to agriculture, high-tech to financial services, Robert Lighthizer has distinguished himself as a tireless defender of America's workers and America's future, and now he'll be doing it for the United States of America. (Applause.)\nRobert, President Trump has now called on you to bring your extraordinary career and considerable talents to help us restore trade that is both free and fair -- benefits the American people above all else.\nGiven your experience, your integrity, and your unwavering commitment to promoting America's interests and protecting the economic prosperity of the American people, President Trump and I are confident that with you as the United States Trade Representative, we will continue to restore opportunity and prosperity for working Americans for generations to come. And we will make America prosperous again. (Applause.)\nSo, on behalf of President Donald Trump, it is now my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath is administered.) (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Ladies and gentlemen, the United States Trade Representative, Bob Lighthizer. (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER: Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President. Thank you for doing me the honor of being here today. It's a great privilege to be in this administration, but to have the Vice President administer the oath is a special privilege. And I would like to thank you for all you do, including particularly Thursday's speech, which I thought was quite meaningful and very important.\nI would like to thank the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Roberts, who is really important because he's on the finance committee, however. (Laughter.)\nAnd I'd like to thank Secretary Ross who was here, but mostly Senator Dole, who I -- when I had my hearing I said, I wouldn't be here but for you. And he said, no, no, no. I said, people say that, but it's in fact true this time. (Laughter.)\nSo you're a great American and a great mentor, and I'm blessed to have you as a friend.\nMy close friends, many of whom are here today, know that I read a lot of history and particularly presidential history. And I believe that when all the dust of partisan vitriol has settled and serious people provide thoughtful analysis, the Trump administration will be ranked as one of the greatest in American history. (Applause.)\nI am grateful to have been asked by the President to serve him on this very important issue of international trade. I further believe that when my grandchildren, who are here today, talk to their grandchildren, they will say that President Trump permanently reversed the dangerous trajectory of American trade, put America first, made our farmers, ranchers, and workers richer, and the country safer.\nAnd I hope I can make some small contribution to that accomplishment. Thank you all very much for being here. I'm very grateful for your friendship.

Mr. President, members of the Cabinet, members of Congress, honored guests and dignitaries, members of the law enforcement community, and the precious families of our fallen, it is National Police Week.

We grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like the rest who have no hope -- because heroes give us hope.\nThe tens of thousands who stand here today continue a tradition of honoring you heroes of our law enforcement communities across America in cities large and small.\nAnd I'm confident to say, as I saw last year on the streets of Howard County, Indiana, where thousands spontaneously poured forth to line the streets to pay a solemn tribute to the late Sheriff's Deputy Carl Koontz, I'm confident today that millions of Americans stand with us in spirit and are breathing a silent prayer for your service and your families.\nWe honor the memory of our heroic fallen in tributes like this across this nation all this week. But we also honor their sacrifice by ensuring that those who protect and serve have the support and the resources and the training that the men and women of law enforcement deserve. (Applause.)\nAs those in uniform across this country already know, President Trump's highest priority is the safety and security of the American people.\nThis President knows in his heart that to make America safe again we must also restore the tradition of respect and honor that is owed to every member of the law enforcement community in America. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump stands with the men and women of law enforcement without apology -- and he always will.\nOn this National Police Week, may God himself comfort the families of the fallen here and those looking on, may God bless each of you as you protect and serve, and may God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124754", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:19 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Before we get started, I want to bring Homeland Security Tom Bossert back up here to discuss the administration's response to the ransomware hacking. And then I'll go on with the events of today and answer your questions.\nWithout further ado, Tom.\nMR. BOSSERT: Thanks, Sean. Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm Tom Bossert, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. And if I could, I'd like to start today by acknowledging the fallen police officers that the President and Vice President acknowledged today. They are the frontlines of our homeland security. And the event today was an honor for me to attend.\nOn cybersecurity, as the President's Homeland Security Advisor, part of my responsibilities is to coordinate U.S. government cybersecurity efforts. I want to give you an update today on the ransomware attack that's been known as WannaCry or WannaCrypt.\nWe continue closely monitoring the situation around the clock at the highest levels of government. We're bringing all the capabilities of the U.S. government to bear on this issue, and are working side-by-side with our partners in the private sector and our international partners. I spoke moments ago with my counterpart in Great Britain and learned an update from them that they have a feeling of control over this ransomware event and that as their affected computers seemed to have been tied to this is a fact that there healthcare system is so large in network.\nThey are painfully aware, though, of the fact that this is a global attack, as are we. As of this morning, it has reached approximately 150 countries and infected more than 300,000 machines. The good news is the infection rates have slowed over the weekend. We had been concerned about that when last we talked.\nThe ransomware has disrupted telecommunications companies, hospitals, and other organizations. The UK National Health Care Service announced 48 of its organizations were affected, and that resulted in inaccessible computers and telephone service, but an extremely minimal effect on disruption to patient care. That was something quite evident in my conversation.\nComputers at the Spanish telecommunications company, Telefonica, were compromised, and we had a small number of affected parties in the U.S., including FedEx.\nSecretary Kelly at the Department of Homeland Security continues to lead operations and public/private coordination. His team is issuing twice daily situation reports, is holding multiple calls per day among experts in operational centers managing our response. As of today, no federal systems are affected.\nOver all, the U.S. infection rate has been lower than many parts of the world, but we may still see a significant impact on additional networks as these malware attacks morph and change.\nDespite appearing to be criminal activity intended to raise money, it appears that less than $70,000 has been paid in ransoms, and we are not aware of payments that led to any data recovery.\nThe Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center is also keeping us informed of the classified insights considering the investigation into the attacks.\nAnd let me talk about now briefly the way ahead. It's important for our business and individuals to know that three variance of this ransomeware are reported to have emerged, using similar techniques. We talked last I was here about variance in this malware. If you follow the mitigation advice published by DHS, the FBI and Microsoft, and have patched your systems, you are protected against all these variance.\nIt's also important to know that pirated, stolen or otherwise unlicensed versions of affected software often will not receive patches. So it's important to not use that unlicensed software. If you do you'll be subject to extraordinarily susceptible infection.\nWhile it would be satisfying to hold accountable those responsible for the attack, something that we are working on quite seriously, the worm is in the wild, so to speak, at this point, and patching is the most important message, as a result. Our business and government have responded with upgrades and patches, defensive mitigations, and this has dramatically reduced the vulnerable population over the last three days. But this needs to continue to be our focus.\nI would finish by repeating advice that all organizations be vigilant in updating their software and that the only computers that can be compromised by the WannaCry or WannaCrypt virus are ones that do not have the latest security patches available from Microsoft.\nQ: So this is one episode of malware or ransomware. Do you know from the documents and the cyber hacking tools that were stolen from NSA if there are potentially more out there?\nMR. BOSSERT: So there's a little bit of a double question there. Part of that has to do with the underlying vulnerability exploit here used. I think if I could, I'd rather, instead of directly answering that, and can't speak to how we do or don't do our business as a government in that regard, I'd like to instead point out that this was a vulnerability exploit as one part of a much larger tool that was put together by the culpable parties and not by the U.S. government.\nSo this was not a tool developed by the NSA to hold ransom data. This was a tool developed by culpable parties, potentially criminals of foreign nation states, that was put together in such a way so to deliver it with phishing emails, put it into embedded documents, and cause an infection in encryption and locking. So the problem -- and I think I said this morning -- of the underlying vulnerability is something that is a little bit less of a direct point for me.\nQ: I guess a shorter way to put it would be is there more out there that you're worried about that would lead to more attacks in the future?\nMR. BOSSERT: I actually think that the United States, more than probably any other country, is extremely careful with their processes about how they handle any vulnerabilities that they're aware of. That's something that we do when we know of the vulnerability, not when we know we lost a vulnerability. I think that's a key distinction between us and other countries -- and other adversaries that don't provide any such consideration to their people, customers, or industry.\nQ: You mentioned your British counterparts are feeling a sense of control. Was there any time that you monitored this here in the States where you felt there was any lack of control or this could get out of hand here? And if not, what is it about what was here that was protected that didn't exist, for example, in Europe or other parts that have obviously taken a much bigger hit?\nMR. BOSSERT: No comparative lack of control, but my conversation today led me to believe that he felt quite comfortable -- my counterparts felt quite comfortable with where they stood today. Not compared --\nQ: Right. But was there any time that you felt here that things could spiral out of control?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, as we were gaining and gathering more information, it was important for us to determine the parameters of this. Once we got our hands around the parameters of the malware, that's, of course, in the beginning moments that you're trying to get ahold of -- get the malware, analyze it, determine what's happening. In that time frame, you don't feel entirely in control, but you're searching for information. Once we got it and realized what the situation was, we realized there were patches available and had been available since March. And so, from that point, operation centers and communications become the key and they're imperative to how we handle this response.\nAnd from the British perspective, I thought it was important to pass along from them two points -- one, that they thought it was an extremely small number of patients that might have been inconvenienced and not necessarily a disruption to their clinical care, as opposed to their administrative processes. And two, that they felt that some of those reports might have been misstated or overblown given how they had gotten themselves into a position of patching.\nSo we'll have to do the analysis and investigation later as to why certain organizations, systems or sectors were more greatly affected than others. So that's the point I'd like to elaborate.\nQ: What is this bottom line to the average consumer? And what are we going forward to make sure that it doesn't get out in the open and affect --\nMR. BOSSERT: The bottom line for the consumer is patch your software, provide automated patch support if you can -- turn that automated on. Make sure your IT service providers or IT folks within your organizations are patching your software. That's the bottom line. And this particular malware and the three reported variance that we've seen since are all fixable with patch. And that's something that you can get from Microsoft.\nSo that's our bottom line. And I don't want to encroach too much here of Mr. Spicer's time, but if I could, with that, maybe I'll take one more question, Sean, okay?\nQ: Who did it?\nMR. BOSSERT: We don't know. That's the attribution that we're after right now. It would be satisfying for me and for all of our viewers, I think, that if we find them and bring them to justice. I think that's something that sometimes -- attribution can be difficult here. I don't want to say we have no clues. As I stand here today I feel that the best and brightest are working on that.\nSo thank you very much. I'll let you know. Thank you very much.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Tom.\nThe President was pleased to see this morning the National Association of Homebuilders and Wells Fargo announce earlier that recent reports show that U.S. homebuilder confidence continues to rise, with numbers now at their strongest since the housing bust. According to the NAHB's chairman, \"This report shows that builders' optimism in the housing market is solidifying.\"\nWe've already seen tremendous response in the economy in the wake of the President's pro-growth agenda. The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been in a decade. The manufacturing job openings are higher than they've ever been since 2006. And by nearly every measure of economic confidence, the future of the American economy looks very bright.\nThe President is also glad to see businesses once again making significant investments in America from Intel to General Motors to Walmart to Apple, who specifically just announced earlier this month they will start a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing jobs here in the United States.\nAnd it's not just the President's domestic economic policies that are generating optimism. Just last week, we announced the first 10 agreements as part of the 100-day action plan initiated by President Trump during his meeting at\nMar-a-Lago with President Xi of China. As I noted last week, these arrangements are major wins for American companies across many different industries and sectors -- from natural gas to beef exporters to financial services -- who will all now have access to the massive Chinese market.\nAnd, of course, those negotiations continue between our representatives. We look forward to sharing future developments with you as this process continues to unfold.\nThis morning, the President and the Vice President joined tens of thousands of officers and friends of law enforcement at the annual Peace Officers Memorial Service at the United States Capitol. This is the 36th year that the Paternal Order of Police has honored the memory of the brave men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty with this service and ceremony.\nIn the Vice President's opening remarks, he reiterated the Trump administration's commitment to standing with the men and women of law enforcement \"without apology.\" And the President said that these men and women are \"the Thin Blue Line between civilization and chaos. Words cannot express the depth of our gratitude.\" But he hopes that the actions of this administration will show our men and women in blue \"how deeply we care and how strongly we feel about protecting those who protect us all.\"\nEarlier today, the President had the honor of meeting with officers and guests from police departments that recently suffered the loss of a police officer from Ulster County Sheriff's Department, Phoenix Police Department, and the New State Troopers. He also signed a proclamation in honor of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week.\nThe President was honored to just welcome recently in the last few minutes the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi to the White House for an official visit. His Highness if a strong partner of the United States and a leader in the Middle East on a number of important topics, including defense cooperation, regional security, and counterterrorism. The United States and the UAE recently concluded a defense cooperation agreement that will allow us to work more closely together to address common security threats.\nThe President hopes to work together even more closely to resolve regional conflicts that raged across the region for too long. This is the President and His Highness's first meeting, and they have a lot to discuss, including bilateral trade and investment, as well as regional security issues. At the conclusion of the meeting we will make sure to have a readout.\nLater this afternoon, the Vice President will swear in Robert Lighthizer as the United States Trade Representative. Ambassador Lighthizer has spent decades working at the highest levels of American trade policy, including as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under President Reagan. The President is glad to finally have an unquestionably qualified individual in place as we fight for better trade deals that will put the American worker first.\nAnd now that he's officially on board, this afternoon Ambassador Lighthizer is getting straight to work. Tomorrow, he will have a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, and on Thursday he will travel to Vietnam for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings.\nWith Ambassador Lighthizer's swearing-in after an historic show of obstructionism by the Senate Democrats, the President will now finally have his entire Cabinet in place, able to fully implement the President's America First agenda across the entire spectrum of the federal government.\nIn other Cabinet news, Secretary Chao kicked off Infrastructure Week with an event with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this morning, noting the newly reopened I-85 bridge in Atlanta as an example of what can be better accomplished with federal, state and local governments working together. Secretary Chao will be traveling to Atlanta on Thursday for the ceremonial ribbon-cutting.\nSecretary Perry is in Texas today as part of VA Research Week to announce the Vets Project, a joint effort between the Veterans Administration and the Department of Energy to help data-map veterans' health records and solve health-related issues for veterans. This partnership, part of the Trump administration's commitment to modernizing the systems we use to care for our nation's heroes, brings together the VA's unparalleled healthcare and genetic data from its Million Veteran program with the Department of Energy's world-class technology to improve healthcare and quality of life for our veterans.\nSecretary Shulkin of the VA will also be traveling this week to commemorate VA Research Week, speaking at the Brain Trust Pathways event in Boston on Wednesday. This event brings together public and private experts in research, treatment, prosthetics, IT and other specialties to focus on new and innovative ways to support veterans coping with the effects of traumatic brain injury and head trauma.\nThe State Department also had a few briefings today on the next step in addressing the Assad regime and the horrors it has committed on the Syrian people. The Trump administration believes that Syria's political future should be decided by Syrians in a free, credible and transparent process. However, we also believe that in a free process it's unimaginable that Syrians would choose to continue under the Assad leadership.\nSyria will never be stable and secure as long as Assad is in power. The Assad regime has sunk to a new level of depravity, and it has done so with seemingly unconditional support from Russia and Iran. For these reasons, we continue to support the political transition process contained in U.N. security resolution 2254, and support the political process taking place under U.N. oversight in Geneva.\nAs we've said before, the United States remains open to working together with both Russia and Iran to find a solution that leads to a stable and united Syria. But in order for us to work together to bring an end to the violence in Syria, Russia and Iran need to acknowledge the atrocities of the Assad regime and use their influence to stop them.\nAs you can see, it's going to be a busy week for the President, the Cabinet and the staff, leading up to the President's first foreign trip that launches this Friday. We take off for Saudi Arabia later on Friday, and I plan to have General McMaster here hopefully tomorrow to walk through the trip with further detail.\nAnd with that, your questions.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Just in China, NSC Senior Director say the U.S. is forming a working group and say the U.S. company have much to offer. So what's the prospective of the U.S. future collaboration in this --\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned with respect to the 100-day plan, I think there's a lot of areas that we are going to continue to work with China to develop a way forward. I think the relationship that the President established with President Xi down in Mar-a-Lago is continuing to pay dividends for our country. And whether it's this policy, or trade, or market access, we're going to continue to see all of those individuals from the President's Cabinet that were down in Mar-a-Lago continue to work with their counterparts in China to find a path forward.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, a couple of topics, but first of all, back to what you said about Syria. Is the official policy of this administration now regime change in Syria?\nMR. SPICER: I think I've made it very clear what our policy is and continues to be.\nQ: Over the weekend, a lot of complaints from Democrats about the Comey replacement process. First of all, that Jeff Sessions is leading the search -- there are a lot of Democrats who think that because he recused himself from the Russia investigation he should not be in that position. Secondly, some Democrats in the Senate are saying that before they will consider the President's next nominee, they want a special prosecutor appointed to look into the Russia investigation. Can you respond to both of those?\nMR. SPICER: I think this is a process that's running completely as it should. It's being headed by the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General. As we've noted in the past, the FBI director reports to the Deputy Attorney General. They continue to move through a series of highly qualified candidates, and it's -- obviously this is a huge priority for the President to make sure that we have someone that has the ability to administer the proper leadership to the FBI.\nQ: And on the special prosecutor?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's -- there's, frankly, no need for a special prosecutor. We've discussed this before. You have two Senate committees that are looking into this. The FBI is conducting their own review. And I think if you even look at what Acting Director McCabe said last week, he made it very clear that they had the resources that they need and that the work continues.\nBut the bottom line is, again, I think part of it is there's a difference between what we've talked about in that -- and it's been made very clear that there's been, with respect to the President himself, both Senator Schumer, Senator Feinstein, Senator Manchin and everyone else who have been briefed on this have been very clear that there was no collusion with respect to the President himself and no investigation there.\nBlake.\nQ: Thank you. Let me pick up where Mr. Bossert left off about this -- about the ransomeware attack. In the short term -- a short-term question and a long-term question. In the short term, is it the advice of the administration -- should somebody be -- who has their computer system infected not to pay the ransom?\nMR. SPICER: As I said, I think that what we have seen so far that is the most effective is that if people take the necessary proper steps in advance and use the patches that are available to ensure that it doesn't happen. So prevention is right now the key that we're stressing.\nQ: As it relates to the long term, at the end of the day this is extortion from likely hostile foreign actors. Might the administration set some sort of guidelines or policies as it relates to U.S. individuals, U.S. companies? Should they be approached as to what to do and maybe what not to do?\nMR. SPICER: I think we can -- our immediate goal right now is to make sure we're protecting our both individual, commercial and government enterprises. And that work has proved to be -- the prudent steps that were taken have proven to be fruitful. And I think we're going to continue that. Right now, obviously, that's the number-one priority.\nQ: Do you know what -- he mentioned FedEx. Do you know if that was a -- something specific happened to FedEx?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I can have Tom follow up.\nJim. Fred, I'm sorry.\nQ: Thank you. Yeah, I wanted to ask about the election integrity commission. Is the primary goal of this going to be looking for recommending reforms of the federal laws, like the NDRA, or looking at (inaudible) or is it going to be more of an audit of the 2016 election?\nMR. SPICER: The executive order that the President signed, and the Vice President and Secretary of State Kobach are leading, is a bipartisan commission of state elections officials that are going to look at all aspects of election integrity, including voter fraud and proper registration, and allegations of voter suppression. So I think they're looking at this holistically.\nQ: Okay, and one more. As far as North Korea goes, with the new South Korean government coming in, does the administration advise against their reaching out or (inaudible) that they had towards the North Korean regime?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, say the --\nQ: Oh, the new South Korean government -- is the administration advising against South Korea reaching out to North Korea after this weekend's missile test?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President looks forward to having a conversation with the new President and discussing the way forward, but I'm not going to get ahead of that discussion at this point.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. On the search for the new FBI director, the President today said that it's \"moving rapidly.\" One name that was put forward over the course of the past 24 hours by the Senate Majority Leader is that of Merrick Garland. Is that a name that the President would possibly consider in the move to name a new FBI director?\nMR. SPICER: The search for a new FBI director is being handled by the Department of Justice. My expectation would be that once they've conducted that search, they'll present names for consideration to the President. But they are the ones that are leading that effort.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, can I follow up on the tape question from last week? As you know, several Republicans have joined Democrats in seeking additional information from the White House, in writing, about the existence of any tapes, producing the tapes, and any further information about the potential taping of conversations. Is the White House intending to cooperate with those requests and furnish that information as requested in writing?\nMR. SPICER: I think I made it clear last week that the President has nothing further on that.\nHunter.\nQ: Wait, wait -- Sean, does that mean that the President will deny the request?\nMR. SPICER: I said -- I was very clear that the President would have nothing further on that last week.\nQ: You're describing a situation in which the President would defy the legislative branch's request. That's what you're saying.\nMR. SPICER: Alexis, I made it clear what the President's position is on that issue.\nHunter.\nQ: Sean, people clearly still have concerns about Russia's role in the election, even though the President has essentially said there's nothing to it. If there is nothing to hide, why not back a special prosecutor or independent commission just to settle it beyond any doubt?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, it's not a question of -- it's at what point -- you have a House and Senate -- a House committee, a Senate committee, the FBI. I don't know why you need additional resources when you already have three entities.\nQ: Well, we saw polling this weekend from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, but that's --\nQ: -- 80 percent of people want this, and they don't have confidence in Congress.\nMR. SPICER: With all due respect, I think the bottom line is you have three entities already looking into this matter. I think the President's position has been very clear that there's two issues at hand. One is the involvement of Russia potentially in -- with respect to an election, and then the President's involvement. The FBI director and others have made it very clear that the President is not a subject of anything. I think we have plenty of entities looking into that.\nTrey.\nQ: Sean, two questions for you. On North Korea, is there a new sense of urgency for President Trump to act following the successful ballistic missile test over the weekend?\nMR. SPICER: I think there is no question that North Korea continues to threaten the United States and our allies, Japan, South Korea, and its neighbors, including both China and Russia. I think we are calling on all of those folks in the region, particularly China and Russia, to do everything they can in terms of sanctions to help resolve the situation and bring stability to the Peninsula.\nQ: On a quick domestic issue, what characteristics is President Trump looking for in an FBI director?\nMR. SPICER: I think obviously he wants someone with high integrity and the leadership skills to lead the entity. But I have not specifically discussed the qualities with him.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First one -- you told us over and over that, for NAFTA, we were waiting for Lighthizer -- Robert Lighthizer -- to be confirmed. Now he's going to be sworn in. Can you give us a better idea on the pace of the renegotiation of NAFTA now that we have a Trade Representative?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think -- I'd have to check the calendar, but I think we've got an hour or two before he's actually sworn in, so you may want to give him a little bit of time.\nQ: Can we say like --\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- because until he's sworn in and assumes the position -- as I mentioned, he's going to immediately go up to Capitol Hill and then off to APEC in Vietnam. So I'm sure we'll get around to it, but right now we still need to just go through the process of getting him sworn in.\nQ: Last week -- quickly -- H.R. McMaster touched the topic. But when the President will be with NATO allies, is he going to ask for a larger, bigger involvement in Afghanistan with troops on the ground, from the members?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what he will say or will not say. He'll have an opportunity to make his position very clear when he goes.\nQ: But more allies with soldiers on the ground?\nMR. SPICER: I think until -- he hasn't even -- I don't think -- we haven't announced the Afghan strategy yet. I think he's been very clear. With respect to NATO, there's two issues. One is, he'd like to see a greater effort placed on counterterrorism -- on combatting terrorism. And two is to see more of the countries living up to their financial obligation that they agreed to.\nJim.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. A two-part question. Is President Trump still committed to his 15-percent corporate tax rate? He's also under pressure to keep some existing loopholes, such as eliminating the state income tax write-off for high state taxes, such as New York and California. So is he committed to the 15-percent corporate tax rate? And is he also full steam ahead on getting rid of the write-off for high-tax states?\nMR. SPICER: Well, Secretary Mnuchin and Director Cohn outlined the principles of his tax reform plan. We continue to meet with stakeholders and members of Capitol Hill, but that conversation continues. As I said at the outset, they're continuing to meet with individuals and those are part of those talks. So his plan has been pretty clear from the beginning as far as what he wants to see and the framework in which it's being guided.\nQ: Should low-tax states, though, subsidize higher-tax states? Because places like Florida and Tennessee can't write off zero income taxes.\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to get head of that debate. I think the principles that were outlines explain where the President's starting point is. He's going to continue to have those discussions.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. On the search for the new FBI director, there have been some critics who have said in this particular political climate, whoever it is shouldn't be a current or former politician. We saw the list of people who have been interviewed, and we see that at least two of them are either current or former political figures. Does the President have a feeling on whether or not having held elective office is a plus or a minus to hold that job?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- as I mentioned just a minute ago, I have not talked to him about the specific qualities he's looking forward to seeing. But I know the Department of Justice continues to meet with these individuals, and so we'll have to see who they put forward.\nHallie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I have two questions for you, but I guess I'm just looking for some clarity on one of my colleague's questions here. Why won't you just explain whether or not there are recordings of the President's conversation?\nMR. SPICER: The President has made it clear what his position is.\nQ: That's not my question, so why won't you explain it?\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. Because that's what the President's position is.\nQ: So given that you refuse to confirm or deny any of this, how is any senior official supposed to feel comfortable having a conversation privately with the President?\nMR. SPICER: As I've said, Hallie, the President has made it clear what his position is.\nQ: Even with these congressional lawmakers calling --\nMR. SPICER: Hallie, I've answered the question over and over again the same way.\nQ: So the second question that I have for you then is on the arguments that are happening now in the 9th Circuit regarding the administration's travel ban. One of the lines of questioning has been why the President has not disavowed his Muslim ban. Will he do that?\nMR. SPICER: The President -- the executive order is fully lawful and will be upheld. We fully believe that. I think there's no question -- in fact, in one of the arguments in the previous cases, it was made clear that if anyone else had proposed this -- which just shows that it is legally sound. People are misinterpreting it. It was based on the law and the authority that the President rightfully has. That's it, plain and simple.\nQ: My question is more, will he disavow the ban? He's never said it --\nMR. SPICER: But the point is, is that the ban -- the measures that he took in that executive order are fully lawful and fully compliant, and make it clear that they seek to keep this country safe. That's it.\nQ: But given these questions come up, is there any indication the President will come out and say, yes, I disavow what I said about not allowing --\nMR. SPICER: Right now the President is focused on making sure that we make the appropriate arguments to get the ban in place.\nJon-Christopher.\nQ: Thank you. Considering in contrast to much of the expression during the French presidential election -- and that has been reported in France, especially -- there may be a lot more in common between President Trump and the new President, Emmanuel Macron of France. Both former successful businessmen, both leaders of two very powerful countries, and two of the oldest allies going, basically. Knowing this, would the President look forward to an opportunity to bring this young President closer to him? Maybe meeting on the borders in -- at the G7? Or maybe even inviting him here to the Maison Blanche in the next few months?\nMR. SPICER: If we have updates to share on additional -- individual leaders that he will be meeting with or meetings that he'll have during his trip, we'll be sure to give you an update on that. But with respect to whether it's the French President or any other head of government, the President looks forward to reasserting America's role in the world and reestablishing some of the relationships.\nAnd I think what you've seen so far -- whether it's President Xi, or Prime Minister Abe, or other individuals -- as you can see by the week that we're having this week with the UAE, Turkey, Colombia, the President has made it very clear that he is going to do everything he can to reestablish relationships around the globe to help protect and advance our national interests.\nQ: This is a special one.\nMR. SPICER: They're all. Look --\nQ: The oldest one. Before we were a republic.\nMR. SPICER: Look -- right. I understand. There's a lot of relationships that the President wants to strengthen for the good of this country.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two brief questions. First, there are reports -- and it may be confirmed by now -- that Mrs. Callista Gingrich will be the third woman to be U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. Official?\nMR. SPICER: Nothing is official until it's announced.\nQ: All right. Has her name been vetted with the Vatican?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- that's a nice back-try, but I'm not going to -- (laughter.) The answer is we have no personnel announcements.\nQ: The other question is not related to personnel but process with the FBI director. Sarah spoke last week about an interim or an acting director of the FBI. But with the interviews that you describe with the Department of Justice, can we expect that the name who is nominated for the position from that podium will be for permanent director and promptly submitted to the Senate?\nMR. SPICER: That's what I believe the President's expectation is, yes.\nQ: So no interim or acting?\nMR. SPICER: Well, you have acting now until someone is selected. But the reason that the President's team is going through this process is to select the next director.\nMara.\nQ: I have -- I know this isn't on the front burner right now, but I have actually the healthcare question.\nMR. SPICER: Okay.\nQ: As it goes to the Senate, I'm wondering if the President's negotiating strategy will change. Does he want to get involved earlier? Does he want to wait till the Senate kind of comes up with something? Does he have anything in particular he wants them to keep from the House bill, get rid of from the House bill? What's his approach to this new chapter in the AHCA repeal process?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think he feels very strong about the product that came out of the House, but he recognizes that the Senate has a duty to review it and to come up with ideas. And if it could be made stronger, then great. He's continued to have conversations with members of the Senate. His staff has had them as well. Our legislative team and others are in communication with the Senate and we'll continue to work with them.\nBut obviously they're an independent body. They have a right to go through their own process. And if we can make the bill stronger in any particular way, that's something that he'll support.\nQ: But he kind of came in at the end to kind of close the deal in the House. Does he want to get involve more in the earlier stages of the process in the Senate, or just stick with the same negotiating strategy?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the team has been intricately involved in the process for quite some time. And the President by several accounts was involved in a way that people hadn't seen on Capitol Hill in a long, long time.\nQ: Two things. Just going back to the FBI director search, should we expect the President to begin interviewing personally the short short list before he leaves on the trip?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's going to be driven by the Department of Justice. And as soon as the Department of Justice has a recommendation for the President, then we'll move on. But at this time, I don't have -- there's no update on where that is.\nQ: And I want to go back to -- you started off with Syria there. The State Department today, of course, announced that the Syrian government has apparently been carrying out mass killings, burning thousands of prisoners. I'm wondering if that crosses any kind of red line for the President and whether we should expect to see any kind of military response to that.\nMR. SPICER: Well, the President has always been clear that he's not going to telegraph actions that he takes. So that's number one. Number two is, I think what was important about what the State Department did today was to really enumerate the atrocities and the human rights violations that have been committed, and then further ask the world community to join with us to put pressure on Syria.\nQ: Should we expect any direct action by the President --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I don't think -- the President has made clear over and over again that he doesn't telegraph his actions. He's going to be continuing to raise this issue, but when he's ready to act he'll let everyone know.\nJen.\nQ: When it comes to vetting for the FBI director, after the experience with Michael Flynn, is the White House recommending doing anything differently with vetting the FBI director? Are you already doing something different with that vetting?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into internal processes that exist, but obviously, we will -- you'd have the full resources of the FBI. So I'm not going to get into how that process is handled.\nQ: But are you going to change things up?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the processes of how that's being done.\nQ: Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: Okay. Two questions. Wanted to follow up on Hallie's question. How has the President made it clear what his position is on the --\nMR. SPICER: I've answered that several times.\nQ: -- he made it clear. All I've seen is the tweet.\nMR. SPICER: Right. So that's his position. He said that he has nothing further to add.\nQ: Okay, but he had \"tapes\" in quotes.\nMR. SPICER: Kaitlan, I understand.\nQ: Okay, I just wanted you to -- clarification on it.\nMR. SPICER: There's nothing further to add on that.\nQ: My second question is, has he made any other inquiries about the Russia investigation to any other FBI officials?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- no, not that I'm -- I haven't asked him about that but I'm not aware of anything.\nQ: Okay, and one small follow-up. Last week, you said you would get back to us on who requested the dinner between him and Comey.\nMR. SPICER: I still don't -- I apologize, I will follow up on that today. I think one of the things that's important with respect to that -- just to clear something up -- I think that there was clearly bipartisan support that Jim Comey wasn't up to the job. The President has every right to fire a person because he believed Director Comey lacked the judgment and the decision-making skills and wasn't up to the job.\nThe President's reaction to this, to what -- his position has been completely misrepresented. If you think about what he said to NBC News, he said, one, he didn't care that this action would made matter worse for him, that it \"might even lengthen out the investigation\" because he would take action against Jim Comey in firing him. He said that he wants the investigation to be done \"absolutely properly,\" and he said that it might even confuse some people that he would take this action knowing it would make matters worse for him.\nThe actions that he took he knew could be detrimental to himself, but none of those things mattered because the President had to do the right thing for the American people because he believes that Jim Comey was the wrong man for that position. And I think that we've got to be very clear as to the reason that the President took the actions that he did. He knew that what he did could be detrimental to himself, it could lengthen the investigation, but he knew it was the right thing for the country, the right thing for the FBI, and the right thing to get to the bottom of this.\nQ: Why does he feel that Comey was the wrong person for the American people?\nMR. SPICER: Because he didn't have the leadership skills necessary to lead this -- that institution. And as he said in the statement at the time, the FBI is the crown jewel of law enforcement and they deserve a leader that can properly lead the institution.\nThank you guys very much. I'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:53 P.M.

Wow, what a beautiful introduction. Thank you, Chuck. Come here. [Laughter] That was so nice. That was above and beyond. That's the way I'm going to be with you too. And it's a great honor—thank you very much—it's a great honor to address America's heroes on this most solemn occasion.\nWords cannot express the depths of our gratitude, but I hope that our actions will show you how deeply we care and how strongly we feel about protecting those who protect us. America stands strong with our men and women in blue. Believe me, we stand strong together.\nI want to recognize Jim Pasco, Linda Hennie, Chaplain Wiggins, and everyone at the Fraternal Order of Police for all that you do to protect the law enforcement of this country and all of our communities. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. As long as I'm President, you will always find an open door to the White House. And you've already found it, believe me.\nMr. Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, and Members of Congress: We are gathered here today at the U.S. Capitol to pay tribute to those brave law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty. On this Police Officers Memorial Day, we thank God for having blessed so many of us with such incredible heroes, and we pledge our solidarity with their families and loved ones. And many of those great families and survivors are here with us today, and I'd love you to stand up. Families and survivors—what great, incredible people. And your loved ones are looking down on you right now, believe me, and they're very proud. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much for being here. Whatever you need, we are here for you, and we are praying for you.\nAs I look out today at this amazing assembly of police, detectives, marshals, and sheriffs, I want to make all of you remember and heed this promise: I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement as much as you have always supported me. And you did, big league.\nYour presence here reminds us all of what is at stake on this sacred day of remembrance. Each May, during Police Week, new names of fallen police officers are added to the National Law Enforcement Memorial. This year, 394 brave souls joined the over 20,000 men and women who gave up their lives in the line of duty to protect us. The names of these heroes are not only carved into that wall, but carved into the hearts of the American people. And by the way, the American people love you, more than you will ever know. I can tell you that.\nThough your loved ones left us much too soon, the memory of their courage will live on forever. To see so many names together is to gain only a small glimpse of the debt America owes to those who protect our cities and police on our streets.\nWe are privileged this morning to be joined by families of the fallen, to whom we owe that ultimate loyalty. So many people, even back here. Please know that you do not grieve alone. Though we cannot fathom the depths of your loss, nor fully appreciate the bond that forms in the precinct and between partners on the beat, your sadness is left and felt by all of us. Every drop of blood spilled from our heroes in blue is a wound inflicted upon the whole country. And every heartache known by your families in law enforcement is a sorrow shared by the entire family of the American nation.\nNo one asked these selfless men and women to enlist in this righteous cause or to enroll as foot soldiers in the eternal struggle against crime and violence. They joined the cause because their hearts were big and full of amazing courage. They joined because they cared so deeply for the innocent and helpless and forgotten. They put on the uniform because they believed to the very core of their souls, that it was their mission in life to serve and to protect.\nAs the Bible tells us, there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. The names and stories on that wall are each a testament to this pure and unselfish love. And that's what it is: pure and unselfish love. And it is our duty as a people and as a nation to prove worthy of their sacrifice. And that begins with showing our police the appreciation they have earned a thousand times over.\nLiving in New York, I gained a deep appreciation and lasting admiration for law enforcement. Thousands of people are living and enjoying life today in New York who otherwise would be gone because our great police fought to bring safety to our streets and our communities. The entire world witnessed the heroism of New York's finest when they gave their lives on 9/11—I was there—and sacrificed so much in that brutal, horrible aftermath.\nNow, as President, my highest duty is to keep America safe. We will keep America safe. And included in safe means safe from crimes, safe from terrorism, and safe from all enemies, foreign and domestic. At the center of that duty is the requirement to ensure that our law enforcement personnel are given the tools and resources they need to do their jobs and to come home to their families safely.\nYou are the thin blue line between civilization and chaos. You come from every community and all walks of life. You are mothers and fathers and sons and daughters. You rush into unknown danger, risking your lives for people you have never met, people you don't know, performing your duty under the most difficult conditions and often without any thanks at all.\nBecause you do not hear nearly enough, I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police. And a very sad thing is that many of today's politicians don't want to say that, don't want to talk about that because it's not politically correct or they think it might hurt them with the voters. I will say it, and I will talk about it proudly. I will make it the personal priority of my administration to ensure that our police are finally treated fairly, with honor and respect that they deserve.\nTo all Americans watching this event today, next time you see a cop on the beat, take a moment to say two wonderful words, which they so readily deserve: thank you. Thank you.\nAs you all know much too well, we are living through an era in which our police have been subject to unfair defamation and vilification, and even—really, I mean, you see what's going on, you see what's going—even worse, hostility and violence. More officers were slain last year in ambushes than in any year in more than two decades, including—and that's so incredible to even have to be speaking about this—the beloved officers killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in yet another murderous attack of law enforcement. And we have some of those incredible families and survivors with us. Thank you.\nThe attacks on our police are a stain on the very fabric of our society, and you are entitled to leadership at the highest level that will draw a bright line in the sand—not a red line in the sand that isn't gone over—but a bright line in the sand. And we will protect you. That I can tell you. And we will say, \"Enough is enough.\" The attacks on our police must end, and they must end right now.\nAnd just to show you, by the way, how much I love our police, I said, oh, I'm going to need a hat because it's so windy today. [Laughter] I said, when I got out here, there's no way I'm going to put on this hat. So we'll leave off the hat. And this is for you, Micah. That's from—that's for our beautiful Micah down there.\nWe must also end the reckless words of incitement that give rise to danger and give rise to violence. It is time to work with our cops, not against them, but to support them in making our streets safe; not to obstruct them, which we're doing. We obstruct them.\nIt is time for all Americans, from all parties and beliefs, to join together in a simple goal to ensure that every child in America has the right to grow up in safety, security, and peace. True social justice means a future where every child in every neighborhood can play outside without fear, can walk home safely from school, and can live out the beautiful dreams that fill their heart—like you, Micah.\nFreedom includes the right to be free—and I mean totally free—from crime and from violence. MS-13 is going to be gone from our streets very soon, believe me. It's these two guys.\nWhen policing is reduced, it's often the poorest and most vulnerable Americans who are the first to suffer. We have all seen the tragic rise in violence and crimes in many of our disadvantaged communities. We've seen the unbearable horror of the shortcomings in Baltimore and Chicago that have cut short so many lives and so many beautiful, beautiful dreams.\nWe cannot stand for such violence. We cannot tolerate such pain. We cannot, under any circumstances, any longer turn a blind eye to this suffering that's going on any longer. And we won't.\nIt's time for a grateful nation to join hands with our police and with our sheriffs to build the bridges of cooperation and trust and to make our streets safer for every man, woman, and child in America. And someday, many of the young children you are protecting will decide that they, too, want to be police officers, that they, too, want to be sheriffs, they want to be cops—they want to be cops. They want to protect people because they love people. And that's what they're going to do, and they're going to do it well. They're going to be great at it.\nAs we seek this better and brighter future, we do so in the memory of these brave but gentle souls who were stolen from this world when they had so much left to share and to give not only to us but to their incredible families.\nAmong them were Patrolman Justin Martin and Sergeant Tony Beminio, who were murdered last November. Patrolman Martin was on the beat for less than a year and leaves a beautiful, loving mom and dad, Randy and Jayne. And thank you, Randy and Jayne. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sergeant Beminio was a veteran of 11 years and leaves behind his wife Zoe and his wonderful children Cameron, Haley, and Maddox.\nAshley Guindon of the Prince William County Police fell in the line of duty on her very first day on the beat. She swore the oath to protect and serve only a day prior to her death. One day. Officer Guindon was dedicated to serving our Nation; she also served in the Marines. And today our thoughts are with her and her incredible mother Sharon. Thank you, Sharon. Thank you. Thank you, Sharon. Thank you. I also had the privilege to meet at the White House just a little while ago with representatives from the Phoenix Police Department, New Jersey State Troopers, and the Ulster County Sheriff's Department, who are mourning the deaths of State Trooper Frankie Williams and Sergeant Kerry Winters.\nI had the chance to spend time with Officer Glasser's beautiful family, his wife Kristen and his 6-year-old son Micah—who has my hat, and he's now with us. Micah, stand up. Kristen, please stand up. Great people. Kristen and Micah, I know your beloved husband and father is looking down on you right now from heaven, and he is so proud of you both. And thank you very much. Thank you.\nWe also remember those incredible heroes who were so cruelly targeted for execution in Dallas, Texas, rushing into a hail of gunfire, never to return. Dallas Police Sergeant Michael Smith was a 27-year veteran of the Dallas Police. He was decorated a law enforcement officer at the highest level and even paid his own way to attend advanced training sessions. He leaves behind his cherished wife Heidi and his loving daughters Victoria and Caroline. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nLast Friday, in Kirkersville, Ohio, a gunman shot and killed Steven Eric DiSario. He was the Chief of the Kirkersville Police Department. He died responding to a hostage situation at a local nursing home. Chief DiSario leaves behind six children and his wife, who is expecting another child. Our hearts break for the Chief's family. We love you all. We love you all. Thank you.\nTo every child in America who has lost a mom or a dad in the line of duty, I want you to know your parents are American heroes—American heroes. They died keeping us safe. They are the pride of our Nation. And we will hold them in our hearts always and forever. Their sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten.\nTo everyone in the audience here today, I want you to know that my administration is determined—totally determined—to restore law and order and justice for all Americans, and we're going to do it quickly.\nAnd that is why I'm so proud to be here today with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Director John Kelly, two men who are deeply committed to the rule of law, to the rank-and-file officers who enforce it, and to bringing the violent criminals, drug dealers, and gang members to justice. And I mean bring them to justice quickly. Thank you very much for being here.\nAll of you at this ceremony, the men and women who police the streets or who send our loved ones to work with a really very, very, sometimes worried or heavy heart—every single day you do that—you've seen and you've heard things that no one else should ever have to see or hear. You bear this burden on our behalf. You have witnessed the evil of those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain on the innocent. You've seen a lot of that more recently than maybe ever before. It's going to stop. And you've watched great, great people suffer unthinkable harm and unthinkable death.\nAmerica as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them. We owe it to the fallen to act according to our best and highest ideals. We owe it to their memory to put truth before politics, justice before agendas, and to put the safety and security of the American people above everything else. And we owe it to them to build a better future for all of America's wonderful children. May today be the beginning of a new era of respect and appreciation for law enforcement. May this ceremony bring new hope to those in search of healing, harmony, and peace. May Americans learn from the example of the heroes we have lost, and always remember to trust each other, work with each other, and love each other.\nAnd finally—and so importantly—may God bless you. May God bless our police. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-05-15", "title": "Remarks at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service"}

Police officers are the thin blue line whose sacrifices protect and serve us every day, and we pledge to support them as they risk their lives to safeguard ours.\nLast year, 118 officers died in the line of duty, and of those, 66 were victims of malicious attacks. These attacks increased by nearly 40 percent from 2015. This must end. That is why one of my first actions was to direct the Department of Justice to develop a strategy to better prevent and prosecute crimes of violence against our Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers.\nIn addition, my Administration will continue to further the efforts of the Department of Justice to improve the lives of law enforcement officers and their families. This includes supporting the Officer Safety and Wellness Group, which improves officer safety on the job, and accelerating the processing of benefits through the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, which provides vital resources to the families of fallen officers.\nOur liberties depend on the rule of law, and that means supporting the incredible men and women of law enforcement. By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136 and 137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as \"Peace Officers Memorial Day\" and the week in which it falls as \"Police Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2017, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 14 through May 20, 2017, as Police Week. In humble appreciation of our hard-working law enforcement officers, Melania and I will light the White House in blue on May 15. I call upon all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124761", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:09 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Hey, guys. So as we touched on yesterday, the President has got a full schedule here in Washington ahead of the foreign trip. This morning, he had a call with the King of Jordan, following up on the King's recent visit to the White House last month. We expect a readout on that shortly.\nEarlier this afternoon, the President of Turkey arrived for an official visit, as you know. The two leaders obviously made joint statements a little while ago, emphasizing where our countries can come together in their fight against violence and instability in the region. Later this afternoon we'll get a readout on that. They are still wrapping up their lunch together right now.\nLater this afternoon, the President will meet with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, and Director of Office and Budget Mick Mulvaney. Recently, Secretary Price, in HHS, announced that the first public step in implementing one of the President's very first executive orders, minimizing the economic burden of Obamacare, was reevaluating the disastrous Small Business Health Options Program -- or SHOP, as it's called.\nEven Obamacare supporters have to admit that this program has completely failed to meet anything close to the expectations that were set. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated that 2 million employees would enroll in the SHOP exchanges, leveling off at 4 million by this year. According to recent data, there are now fewer than 233,000 people covered by SHOP plans. And the map seen here -- check that out. That's about 6 percent of what was predicted by CBO. So I know in the past some folks have asked about CBO predictions. I'd point you to that one as another one. The numbers don't really get too much better from there.\nTexas has a population of around 28 million people; it had just 1,158 businesses enrolled in the SHOP plan. Florida has a population of around 20 million people and it has 579 businesses enrolled. Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, with 30 million of them supporting communities across the country. And just 0.1 percent of these companies, small businesses, participate in the SHOP program.\nSmall businesses have clearly decided that SHOP is not an option that makes sense for the overwhelming majority of them in its current form, so it's common sense to reevaluate this clearly failed program. And common sense is what the American people elected President Trump to bring to Washington.\nThe bottom line is that whether we're talking about individuals or businesses, signups for Obamacare are well below expectations. Insurance companies continue to flee out of the exchanges. And if we don't act quickly, as the President said, we're going to head for a healthcare meltdown.\nThe President and Secretary Price and this entire administration look forward to seeing the American Health Care Act reach the President's desk soon so that we can bring back some common sense to our entire healthcare system.\nFinally, two quick updates. Secretary Mattis is swearing in Heather Wilson as the Secretary of the Air Force at the Pentagon today at 4:00 p.m. Her distinguished military service, wealth of experience, and wide knowledge base made her an outstanding choice for Secretary of the Air Force. And the President is glad to welcome her on board.\nLastly, Treasury has just announced the sanctions on additional individuals and entities in response to the continuing violent attacks on Syrian citizens by the Syrian government. As long as the Syrian government continues its campaign of brutal violence against its own people the Trump administration will continue to utilize many tools at our disposal to intensify pressure on the Assad regime in support of diplomatic efforts to end this civilian conflict.\nWith that, Hallie.\nQ: I just have a few. If you don't mind, if I just tick through quickly since it's an off-camera briefing. Number one, can you explain the transcripts? Will you share these transcripts that some lawmakers are calling for, or more information regarding the context and content of this meeting with those on Capitol Hill that are asking for this information?\nMR. SPICER: I think there's three individuals who were in the room -- Secretary of State Tillerson, the National Security Director and the Deputy National Security Director who were all in that and all have put out statements regarding that.\nQ: But given that, they want a lot more. They want to see quotes. They want to see transcripts. What do you --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't -- I haven't seen anything. But what I'm telling you is that I think there were three individuals in that meeting that said -- what has occurred today, over the last little while, in terms of these leaks is, frankly, dangerous. The idea that someone who has been given access to information is pushing that information on to the media is -- undermines our national security. I don't think there's any other way to say it than it is, frankly, dangerous.\nQ: Two more questions for you, Sean, just on that. Number one, Israel as the ally here who provided information that the President then shared with the Russians. It's our reporting and others that that is the case. Can you speak to that?\nMR. SPICER: I cannot comment specifically on that. I'm obviously pleased to see Ambassador Dermer's comment. We appreciate the relationship that we have with Israel and appreciate the exchange of information that we have with them. That being said, I'm not going to comment any further on that.\nQ: And my last one question for you just gets to the question of credibility that a lot of folks over on Capitol Hill have been asking over the last maybe 18 hours or so. The President himself tweeted just last week, Sean, that his surrogates can't stand at this podium with perfect accuracy. Are you concerned when you have yourself, when you have General McMaster here, that people perhaps don't trust or find the statements that are being made credible?\nMR. SPICER: I think I addressed this last week, Hallie, that we do everything we can to provide you the most up-to-date information at the time. With respect to the events of last night, I think General McMaster stood at this podium just a few hours ago and made it very clear that he stands by what he said. So I'm not entirely sure -- I think he put out a statement, Secretary Tillerson put out one, and the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy put one out, as well.\nQ: So you're not concerned about eroding credibility in this administration?\nMR. SPICER: Of course. Obviously, I would never -- no one would ever want that. But I suggest to you that the statements put out last night -- completely consistent and the people who put them out, stand by them.\nQ: -- in the room is my last question -- that Dina Powell, Secretary Tillerson --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not sure that -- I don't know the answer to that --\nQ: Can you provide us a readout of who was in that room with him?\nMR. SPICER: I'll follow up with -- I mean, I'm not going to necessarily provide you with information that they're not comfortable providing in terms of who was or wasn't in the room. That is something that is up to the President.\nZeke.\nQ: Sean, do you believe that this is a case of the intelligence community or elements in the intelligence community actively seeking to undermine the President and his foreign policy as he seeks to build a closer relationship with Russia?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think it is appropriate for me to -- but I will tell you, when you look at that story, it would be impossible for the President to reveal the source of the information because, as General McMaster made very clear as he was leaving this podium, the President wasn't briefed on the information and wasn't aware of the source. So the President wasn't aware of this. This wasn't part of his briefing. So, therefore, to suggest that, therefore, he revealed it, is impossible.\nQ: But you did say undermining -- it's, frankly, dangerous.\nMR. SPICER: It is.\nQ: What's the President going to do about it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, that in itself is a whole process, and I'm not at liberty to get into that. And it's, frankly, something that I wouldn't even be aware of.\nQ: If I could ask just one more question. Is it the President's position that he can at any time declassify anything he chooses? He tweeted this morning he has the absolute right to talk to the Russians about whatever he wants to. Is that what he's saying there, that he can declassify anything?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's several issues. One is he can obviously -- there is information that is shared with countries all the time on common threats or common areas of interest. Then there is a second question that you're asking, which is classification authority. My understanding is the President, of course, has classification authority. They're not synonymous though, right?\nSo the President can always discuss common threats or common issues with host nations -- excuse me -- with other heads of government or other government officials as he deems appropriate to tackle the threats our country faces. But that's -- just so you're clear, there are two separate issues. But, yes, he does on the second -- because that's not a question of what he thinks, that's just sort of like a fact.\nBlake.\nQ: Just to clarify the last thing that General McMaster said, what you just said -- so the President wasn't aware -- this wasn't a part of his briefing, so to suggest he revealed it is impossible. Are you saying that the President didn't say what is being --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into -- again, I'm not going to get into the contents of conversation. What I will just say is, as I mentioned, it wasn't part of his briefing. So if that wasn't part of it, to suggest that, therefore, he released something would not -- it just defies logic.\nQ: So if it wasn't part of his briefing, in a way, was there a failure --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not -- look, again, I'm not --\nQ: -- the people underneath him, was there a failure that it didn't rise to the level --\nMR. SPICER: No. I'm sorry. That's a good point. It is not routine. Again, I'm not going to say it doesn't happen. But generally speaking, when the President is briefed -- and it's not just this President -- when Presidents are briefed, they're presented with outcomes. Here's threats that we face. Here's whatever. And it's not like there's always -- and it's not always common that, therefore, they would get into all the sources and methods that undermines it. That's just not always how it happens.\nAnd so they are presented with, here are the threats that we face; here's the circumstances; here's the issues that are in front of you.\nQ: I guess what I'm asking -- he was fully prepared going into this meeting by the --\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Just two for you. Can you say whether or not there's an active investigation of these leaks, either formal or informal?\nMR. SPICER: I cannot.\nQ: Wait, can I just get one more? Something that General McMaster declined to answer on two occasions from behind that podium that's causing some unhappiness on the Hill, the refusal to say whether the Western Wall is in Israel or not. Can you explain why you guys can't answer that question?\nMR. SPICER: The Western Wall is obviously one of the holiest sites in Jewish faith. It's clearly in Jerusalem. But there's been -- it's an issues that's had serious consideration. It will be a topic that's going to be discussed during the President's trip between the parties that he meets with.\nBut obviously I think this stems from a comment that was made yesterday and which was not the policy of the United States. And so I think just because -- so just to be clear about what was said yesterday.\nQ: Can you talk briefly about the ripple of information and how it came out of the meeting that occurred last week in the Oval Office with the representatives of the Russian government? I'm trying to better understand where and how this information could have leaked.\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- if I knew -- I mean, I don't know.\nQ: In talking about it as a national security threat, you've spoken with the President obviously about this. What's his thinking on the information that leaked? And if there were\n-- and what does he think about the article that was released by The Washington Post?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think consistent with what he has said for a long time -- that the leaks of classified information, or sensitive information present -- there's a reason that they're classified. And the disclosure of them, the non-authorized disclosure of them, present a threat to national security.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There's been reporting that suggests Israel is the country that provided that intelligence to the U.S. Whether it was Israel or not, has the administration had contact with that ally to potentially smooth over any complications that might have arisen from this being shared with the Russians?\nMR. SPICER: Have we -- I'm sorry --\nQ: Have you reached out to the country that provided that intelligence?\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, I'm not going to get into that kind of discussion. What I will say is, as I mentioned earlier, that we appreciate the strong relationship that we have with Israel with respect to intelligence-sharing, and hope to continue to grow that bond. But I'm not going to comment on specifically where it came from.\nRonica.\nQ: Sean, can we get a White House reaction or the President's reaction to the report that said Rich was emailing WikiLeaks before his murder?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I'm not aware of -- generally, I don't get updates on DNC -- former DNC staffers. I'm not aware of that.\nQ: It would certainly have a great influence on where the leaks came from, if they could potentially -- I mean, there's a lot of implications in this story, of course. But --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But for me to comment from here about an ongoing investigation -- I believe it's still ongoing; I don't even know the status of it in terms of D.C. -- but it would be highly inappropriate to do that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First, the nature of the information that the President is alleged to have shared are the kinds of things that the Five Eyes allies share among each other. Is this a sign that that list could be expanded or that the President is considering expanding the Five Eyes, the allies we share intelligence with on a regular basis?\nMR. SPICER: I would just go back to the point that I think -- whether it's this particular country or any other, it is quite commonplace for us to share information on common threats that our countries face, or two countries face, or a variety of other information. It is a very commonplace thing to occur.\nQ: And the other thing is, what's lost in all of this was that they -- the President met with Dr. Kissinger. What advice did Dr. Kissinger give him on anything? Was there any readout of their conversation?\nMR. SPICER: I don't have -- I didn't get one at the time. Generally speaking, we don't get readouts of that.\nCecilia.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You had these Comey headlines last week that you didn't want. You've got this story that landed in your lap today. I'm sure you heard Senator Corker say that this White House is in a \"downward spiral.\" How do you view the current state of things right now? Is a \"downward spiral\" fair, unfair? Is \"chaotic\" fair, unfair? And does this White House need a reset?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we're doing -- the President is committed to enacting his agenda. He feels very strongly about what he's doing and why he's doing it. The leaks that occurred today are not helpful, first and foremost, to national security, beyond any other issue. But obviously the President is very proud of the work and the accomplishments that he's had in these first few months, and looking forward to this trip around the world that I think is really going to continue to grow the relationships that he's already started to build.\nQ: Is there any soul-searching that's being done? Any reflection that -- or any blame even being placed for sort of the current state of chaos, if you will, inside the West Wing or in your colleagues, the President himself?\nMR. SPICER: I guess the way I'd answer that is, when you look at what appears to be somebody intentionally leaking classified information, and you're asking where the blame should be placed, I think it's pretty clear. I mean, it is -- to realize that somebody has intentionally gone out, once again -- if you start to go back over the last couple months how many times there has been an unauthorized disclosure of national security, that should be -- I've said it from this podium before, but it's extremely troubling.\nAnd I think that when you ask how we feel about it, when you are committed to doing -- whether it's economic policy or foreign policy that is in the best interest of the country, and people are going out intentionally leaking classified information that threatens national security, as I said, it's dangerous.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, could you tell us how the President gets his intelligence briefings? Because we understand that each President has them differently, they ask for them differently. How does this President receive his intelligence briefings?\nMR. SPICER: That's an interesting question. I don't sit in on the briefing. I know every day a team comes over and -- I should probably follow up on it before I get too far ahead, but they come in person and present him with information, and it's classified.\nQ: Okay. But does he read any part of it, or is he given the information verbally?\nMR. SPICER: I don't sit in on it, so I don't know.\nQ: All right, to follow up on that, a couple questions. The question -- well, the statement from McMaster begs the question as to -- the statement about not having parts of the intelligence that the President talked about to Russia begs a couple questions. Why was that not included? And some are asking, in the intelligence community, does this go to the fact that the President may not be trusted with this information? And also, it goes into, again, how does he get his information and why it was it --\nMR. SPICER: So I know you stepped out for a while. We actually went over this.\nQ: I'm sorry, I was coughing.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, but we went over this. I hope you feel better. Basically, the answer that I gave -- I think it was either Blake or Trey -- was that, generally speaking, the President is presented with the end result of the intelligence -- here are the threats, here are the issues that are facing us. Generally speaking, they don't go into the sources and methods.\nQ: But has there ever been a concern that this President was not able to handle the intelligence information and they've kind of crafted it to a piece where he would not get in trouble if it were to slip out?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Okay, wait, I'm not finished.\nMR. SPICER: No, you are. I mean, this is -- everyone gets a turn. This isn't --\nQ: Well, a couple people had more, and I want to ask something about Secret Service, okay? I understand that David Garrett -- Dave Garrett (ph) is being eyed as the head of the Uniformed Division of Secret Service. And Dave Garrett, during the Clinton administration, was reprimanded for saying the \"N\" word to a female pass-holder here at the White House. What do you say to that?\nMR. SPICER: You have to believe me that I don't get into the different divisions of employment of the Secret Service. I think that --\nQ: But it is under the administration's purview.\nMR. SPICER: Sure, as is all the federal government. But I think specifically a division of the Secret Service, Kathy of the Secret Service is probably -- in the Public Affairs Office -- is probably your best bet.\nGeorge.\nQ: A trip question. There's been a lot of reporting --\nMR. SPICER: We had big news -- it would have been perfect for this --\nQ: There's been a lot of reporting in Israel that the President was going to go to Masada. That's something that General McMaster didn't mention. Has that been scrubbed? If he is going, what's the message you're trying to send?\nMR. SPICER: So, if I can, it is our goal to have an off-the-record briefing tomorrow, probably sometime later in the day, on the logistics of the trip. Once we can lock down that time -- and the goal would be late tomorrow, but it may slip. And we can kind of walk through the logistics of the trip with you. But obviously there's a lot of things that either aren't finalized for security reasons. But I don't want to get into anything beyond what General McMaster said today. And our goal is to -- we'll have notice out to you guys at some point on what the details of the trip are.\nGlenn.\nQ: Sean, it may seem like a small matter, but the President mispronounced President Erdogan's name a couple of times at the event today. We had a report yesterday from Politico about the President reading and embracing a report that was pushed in front of him from a fake 1970s Time Magazine story. We've had numerous things about the way that the President consumes information, including and not exclusive to the events of the last few days.\nTwo questions. Is the President doing his homework? And are you satisfied, or can you tell the American people that the President is getting the best quality information possible to make decisions?\nMR. SPICER: Yes on both.\nSteve Holland.\nQ: Senator Cornyn pulled out of the FBI search. Does the President still think it's possible to name a new director before he goes on the trip? Or is that likely to drag?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's obviously likely, but that's up to both DOJ and then obviously to the President in terms of who he can get.\nQ: Where does it stand at this point, the search?\nMR. SPICER: DOJ is still interviewing candidates. And if we have an update on the process --\nQ: So it probably will drag until after the trip?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I literally don't have an update, because part of it is DOJ will notify us when they believe they have candidates that the President wants to meet with, or the President will ask them who they have. But we're not at that point in the process.\nAnita.\nQ: Can you explain -- you're saying that the leaks, that there's a problem obviously that there's leaks. Other people say that the President said something inappropriate. Regardless of what happened, how can you assure allies that have expressed concern about leaks in the United States that their information is safe with the United States? How can you assure them? Are people calling them? And I don't mean the particular ally; I just mean in general.\nMR. SPICER: Right. I think we take -- look, there is no one who is more outraged about this than the President. And he has been very clear in his statements over the last couple of months that this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated, and that this action undermines our national security.\nI don't know -- I mean, he's taking -- again, and it would be inappropriate for me to discuss anything beyond that.\nQ: Are calls being made?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to get into anything.\nBrian.\nQ: Three quick questions for you. One, President Reagan said -- and they will be quick, I promise -- said of the former Soviet Union that they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, lie, or cheat to attain global revolution.\nThat was their long-term goal.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, what was the beginning part?\nQ: President Reagan has said that the Soviet Union reserves unto itself the right to commit any crime, lie, or cheat to obtain its long-term goals.\nSo what do you think? What does this President think the long-term goals of Russia are? That's the first question.\nThe second is: Do you think a public official has a right at any time to lie to the American public under any circumstance?\nAnd third, I guess going back to our question earlier, but to be more pointed, what do you say to the critics who say this administration in one word, in the last few weeks, has been inept?\nMR. SPICER: I think that --\nQ: I know I nailed you with three.\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- as far as Russia goes, the question is, what do we think their goals are?\nQ: What do you think their long-term goals are?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know -- I'll get -- we'll have to get back to you. I'm not prepared to go over what Russia's strategic goals are at this time.\nSo what was --\nQ: And the second one was, do you think under any circumstance it's all right for a public official to lie to the American public?\nMR. SPICER: The reason I'm hedging on this is that I'm just thinking mentally, going through every position of the United States government. So, in theory, if you were an operative of some sort, or if there was -- I mean, there are cases in which --\nQ: Public officials.\nMR. SPICER: I understand. Yes, if it's a public official, then no.\nQ: And a third one, as far as the last week, the actions from this administration being inept?\nMR. SPICER: Like I said, I think what this is -- when you have people that are leaking information, the President is going to do everything he can, I can tell you that.\nQ: But that's not unique.\nMR. SPICER: I think that the level and number of quotes and the damage, I don't -- I can't say I'm an expert on this, but I would say it's pretty -- it seems like a lot to me.\nQ: A number of Republican lawmakers this morning said they were troubled by what they read in The Washington Post, the story that came out late yesterday afternoon. Senator Lindsey Graham, in an interview that he did today, said, \"The only thing I can say when it comes to Russia is they are an unreliable partner.\" Does the administration share that point of view that Russia is an unreliable partner?\nMR. SPICER: I think, first and foremost, as you saw by the comments of the three individuals, they were troubled by the report in The Washington Post. And so that's the first thing I would say.\nThe second thing is -- because again, look, when you go back and realize that three people who were in a very small meeting come out -- the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, and the Deputy National Security Advisor -- and dispute the account, and yet, on the other hand, you have a bunch of anonymous sources using leaked information that is disputed from what was actually briefed and not briefed, you realize that that -- you have to question the intention of why that was done.\nSo that is something that we're equally concerned with in terms of the report itself, that a leak that came out does this kind of damage. And it was -- and it clearly -- you've got wonder why it was done and who did it.\nQ: But to Lindsey Graham's point that he was making in that comment that I just read to you, does the President share his belief that Russia is an unreliable partner?\nMR. SPICER: I think all I'll say is that on areas like combating ISIS, in particular, we have a shared interest. In Syria, there are areas where we can have a shared interest. And I think in areas where -- whatever country it is, we can find a shared interest to further a goal, whether it's our national interest or our economic interest. That is something that we would have to consider. But to rule out any country on its face is something that is sort of well above -- is something that only the President can decide.\nQ: Sean, why did the President's Counterterrorism Advisor feel the need to reach out to the CIA and the NSA after the meeting with the Foreign Minister?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into calls that any staff member may or may not make, but I will say that to suggest that someone who is the Homeland Security Advisor wouldn't be making calls would somewhat be a little odd that, in the routine part of their job, that they wouldn't be calling around to different agencies.\nThat being said, in terms of what I think you're intending to ask with respect to the article, again, I would go back to the fact that there were three prominent individuals in the meeting that dispute the account.\nQ: Is the White House doing anything to reach out to members of Congress to explain what happened in the meeting with the Russian officials? And Senator Burr, on the Intelligence Committee, said just before you came out that he's still waiting to hear from someone at the White House.\nMR. SPICER: I do believe that there are some folks that people have asked that have walked them through, shared the statements, et cetera, et cetera.\nQ: Are there any plans for the President to reach out himself to any members to explain or reassure?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- not that I'm aware of.\nMatt.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. So you've referenced a few times these statements from McMaster, Tillerson, and Powell. And one thing none of them address is sort of the key point of the article, which is that the President divulged classified information. None of their statements addressed that. So can you clarify for us whether or not the President divulged classified information? Number one. And number two, if so, who gave the okay on that? Was that preapproved by State or by any of these agencies?\nMR. SPICER: So, number one, going back to another question, there is, in the normal course of conversations with different countries -- whether it's threats or information -- information is routinely shared. Secondly, as was mentioned, if the President wanted to share information, that would be within his decision. That all being said, I'm not going to discuss what -- go down a road of parsing what would be and what wouldn't be.\nSarah.\nQ: So you won't clarify whether or not the information he shared was classified?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that the -- as you pointed out, the three statements that were made, they are very clear of what was not addressed. And again, getting into starting to have a discussion about what is and what isn't -- what isn't classified -- is a very dangerous road.\nSarah.\nQ: So, two questions. First, in this meeting with the Russians at the White House, why was the President's first inclination to want to share sensitive information rather than, for instance, to press them on meddling in the U.S. election, which we saw all these intelligence officials agree just last week was something that Russia certainly did?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think to presume that -- I mean, that conversation is still private. And to just assume what was and wasn't discussed would not be accurate. I'm not going to get into the contents of that.\nBut I also think that, again, we're missing what was shared and the purpose. There was a discussion about a shared aviation threat. As General McMaster pointed out, they had an airplane that was taken down in some way in October of 2015, which over 200 lives were lost. They shared and discussed a shared threat that our two countries have and a concern that we have. I think that is extremely appropriate.\nQ: And secondly, one of the knocks against this administration has basically been that you guys do things in a sloppy manner and that makes stories like this worse. So when you look at the way this played out -- yes, we routinely share information, but we routinely share information that is sensitive with our allies. We don't routinely share sensitive information with the Russians.\nSo I guess, did you guys take the proper procedures to let intelligence agencies know ahead of time that you wanted to share this information -- that the President did -- with Russian officials? Or did he just make the call on the spot, and was that the reason that Bossert made these calls afterward to the CIA and to the NSA? And was this a learning experience in any way for this administration about following protocols to ensure you guys don't get the kind of headlines next time that you did this time?\nMR. SPICER: Well, number one, to make any assumptions about what was shared, what wasn't shared, and what processes were or were not followed would be highly speculative.\nNumber two, as I've said repeatedly, the information that was shared was on a common threat and one that we both have a shared goal in eradicating. So to suggest that -- which I think is the nut of the question -- why wouldn't we want to share a common threat and the efforts that both countries are taking to eradicate a threat that we both feel?\nQ: But there's no indication that you guys went through the proper protocols.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, with all due respect, you have no understanding of that. For you -- and I'm not -- but to sit back and say, because it hasn't been leaked out -- I mean, that's the nature of the leak. Somebody is selectively leaking information and facts. And there's a reason it's selective; it's because they're trying to create -- you know, and again, for me to guess why -- but at least it appears as though somebody is trying to create a narrative or a problem.\nBut to further suggest that somehow because you get one piece of a puzzle, that you know what the entire puzzle looks like -- even to suggest that that piece is accurate, which, in this case, you've heard our position on that. But this is clearly a pattern of people releasing sensitive information to further what appears to be someone's agenda.\nAnd I think that, again, the President has raised this. Several people in the administration have raised this. But the idea that there is no concern or seemingly no concern over something like this being put out in the open I think is, frankly, concerning. And it should be to every American that we have information of a sensitive and classified nature that is being sent out into the open.\nQ: But it can be --\nMR. SPICER: Hey, Brian, Brian, brain.\nQ: Right?\nMR. SPICER: That's not how it works. Thank you.\nJessica.\nQ: Sean, if I could follow up on Jon Decker's question, a couple of questions about the fight against ISIL in this context. That was what the President talked about was the source of the conversation, or, I should say, framework of the conversation that he had with the Russians last week. So is the President actively looking for new partners in the fight against ISIL? And is it his intent to look to partners that have previously been unconsidered because they were not part of traditional alliances and partnerships with the United States?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's safe to say that the President is going to look to anybody who wants to share our goal of eradicating radical Islamic terrorism, ISIL, and other threats from around the globe.\nThank you guys very much. Have a great day. We'll talk to you tomorrow in Connecticut.\nEND 2:40 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-16", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Spicer"}

That's a lot of press. Really, a lot of press. I'm shocked.\nIt is a great pleasure to welcome President Erdogan for his first visit to the White House in years. The American and Turkish peoples have been friends and allies for many, many decades. Turkey was a pillar in the cold war against communism. It was a bastion against Soviet expansion. And Turkish courage in war is legendary. That is so true.\nTurkish soldiers fought bravely alongside of American soldiers in the Korean war, and we haven't forgotten what they did. In some ways, when we looked at their great bravery in the fight of Korea—and in Korea, it was just something that our soldiers and our great generals still remember. Supreme Commander General Douglas MacArthur singled out and praised the exemplary valor of the Turkish soldier—said, some of the great soldiers of the world.\nToday, we face a new enemy in the fight against terrorism, and again we seek to face this threat together. The Turkish people have faced horrible terrorist attacks in recent years and even recently. We offer our compassion to the victims, and we offer our support to the Turkish nation.\nWe support Turkey in the first fight against terror and terror groups like ISIS and the PKK, and ensure they have no safe quarter, the terror groups. We also appreciate Turkey's leadership in seeking an end to the horrific killing in Syria. The Syrian civil war shocks the conscience of the whole world. And all you have to do is look on the front page of the papers today, and you'll see exactly what we're talking about. We also support any effort that can be used to reduce the violence in Syria and create the conditions for a peaceful resolution.\nPresident Erdogan and I are also discussing the need to reinvigorate our trade and commercial ties. These are areas where we can build our relationship that will benefit both of our countries. Military equipment was ordered by Turkey and the President, and we've made sure that it gets there quickly.\nI look forward to working together with President Erdogan on achieving peace and security in the Middle East, on confronting the shared threats, and on working toward a future of dignity and safety for all of our people.\nMr. President, thank you for visiting our country and joining us today at the White House. It is a great honor to have you with us. Thank you.\nPresident Erdogan. Thank you. Mr. President, my dear friend, distinguished members of the press, at the outset, I'd like to whole-heartedly salute you all. And I would like to take this—all this opportunity to thank President Trump and his team for the generous hospitality they have shown us upon arrival, not only to my personal self, but to the entire members of my delegation. On behalf of the entire Turkish nation, thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. President Erdogan. And once again, in your presence, I would like to congratulate President Trump for the legendary triumph that he has garnered in the aftermath of the elections.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nPresident Erdogan. Quite recently, we've had bilateral discussions with President Trump, and we've had the opportunity to focus on the outstanding relations between Turkey and the United States that date back a long time in history, which are very well rooted and which are quite—happily reached a level of strategic partnership.\nThe relations between Turkey and the United States have been erected upon common democratic values and common interests. Keeping our outstanding relations stronger than ever will be very important not only for our common interests, but also stability of the globe and peace around the world.\nThe close cooperation that the—both of the countries shall demonstrate, especially in the region, which is currently in turmoil, will be very important for the rest of the world. And primarily, we are alongside by each other as Turkey and the United States, under the roof of the United Nations, NATO, and the G-20.\nWe have been enjoying a close cooperation in all of these platforms, in all of these fora around the world. And in the future to come, we are going to focus on making sure that we're going to expand our close cooperation and build on the outstanding dialogue that we enjoy.\nWe are determined to expand our relations, and I believe my current official visit to the United States will mark a historical turn of tide. Whether it be throughout our bilateral discussions, whether it be the discussions that we shall have between the delegations, I think we are going to enjoy some further gains in terms of the future of our relations. We seem to agree on expanding further relations—expanding our relations in the field of economy, trade, reciprocal investments, energy, and defense industry.\nIt is going to be very important for us to forge a close solidarity and cooperation in the field of fighting terrorism, primarily with Daesh and all the other terrorist organizations in the region. And we are committed to fighting all forms of terrorism, without any discrimination whatsoever, that impose a clear and a present threat upon our future.\nThere is no place for the terrorist organizations in the future of our region. Taking YPG and PYD in the region—taking them into consideration, the region will never be accepted, and it is going to be against a global agreement that we have reached. And we should never allow those groups to manipulate the religious structure and the ethnic structure of the region, making terrorism as a pretext or an excuse.\nThose who are willing to turn to chaos in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya are bound to lose eventually. They will never be able to turn that chaos in that part of the world into an opportunity, and the terrorist organizations with blood in their hands are bound to fail.\nAnd as I have previously done so, I have been very frankly communicating our expectations with regard to the Fethullahist terrorist organization, which we have notified our friends of their involvement in the failed coup of July the 15th in Turkey. And we have taken into consideration the joint steps that we can take forward in Syria and Iraq.\nOf course, President Trump's recent election victory has led to the awakening of a new set of aspirations and expectations and hopes in our region. And we know that, by the help of the new U.S. administration, these hopes will not be lost in vain. And we find that it was the most necessary answer to be given to the Syrian regime, especially in the aftermath of the recent chemical attacks that took place. And we know that, in terms of keeping up with the principled and committed fight against the terrorists organizations all around the world, we will not repeat the mistakes of the past, and we will continue down this path together.\nIn the restoration and the establishment of stability and security of the region in question, the alliance and this partnership and cooperation between the United States and Turkey is of vital importance. I hope and pray that both of us will be committed to expanding further our cooperation in the future along with consulting each other more frequently. We are laying the foundation of a new era between the two countries in terms of our relations. I hope and pray that this new administration will bring forth auspicious results for the relations.\nAnd I would like to thank President Trump for his very kind and cordial invitation, and I'm looking forward to hosting him in Turkey along with his entire family.\nPresident Trump. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it. We're going to go to meetings now.\nPresident Trump's May 10 Meeting With Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov of Russia/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization\nQ. Mr. President—[inaudible]—about the intelligence that you spoke with the Russians about?\nPresident Trump. Well, we had a very, very successful meeting with the Foreign Minister of Russia. Our fight is against ISIS, as General McMaster said. I thought he said, and I know he feels, that we had a—actually a great meeting with the Foreign Minister.\nSo we're going to have a lot of great success over the next coming years, and we want to get as many to help fight terrorism as possible. And that's one of the beautiful things that's happening with Turkey. The relationship that we have together will be unbeatable.\nSo thank you all very much. I appreciate it. We're going to meetings right now. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-05-16", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and an Exchange With Reporters"}

How are you? I hope you all enjoyed your time in New London. I think the President is getting some pretty wide acclaim for the speech at the Coast Guard Academy today.\nI think just to kind of recap a couple of the points, he made it very clear in the speech, the advice that he gave to students, to not only defend the American security, but you protect American prosperity. It's a mission that goes back to the earliest days of the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\"Today, the Coast Guard helps keep our waters open for Americans to do business, it keeps our rivers flowing with commerce, and it keeps our ports churning with American exports. You help billions of dollars of goods to navigate our country every day. You're the only federal presence in our inland waterways. You police the arteries we need to rebuild this country and to bring prosperity back to our heartland.\"\nHe talked about the fact, as you heard, that together, they have the same mission -- \"Your devotion and dedication makes me proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.\" And then lastly, he basically made it clear and highlighted, as you heard, the speech trip he's about to take when he said, \"In a few days I will make my first trip abroad as your President, with the safety, security and the interests of the American people as my priority. I will strengthen our old friendships and seek new partners. I will ask them to unite for a future of peace and opportunity for our peoples and for the world. First, in Saudi Arabia where I'll speak to Muslim leaders and challenge them to fight hatred and extreme -- and embrace a peaceful future for their faith. Then in Israel, I'll reaffirm our unbreakable alliance with the Jewish state. In Rome, I'll talk with Pope Francis about the contributions of Christian teachings to the world. Finally, I'll attend the NATO Summit in Brussels and the G7 in Sicily to promote security, prosperity and peace.\"\nTonight, after the President returns, he's going to spend a good chunk of today preparing for the visit of the President of Colombia tomorrow.\nThis evening, the Vice President will deliver remarks on behalf of the First Family at an Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month reception in his ceremonial office. He'll be joined by Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao; Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, Seema Verma; and Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton. The Vice President will discuss his recent trip to the Asia Pacific, the many contributions that Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent have made around the country.\nAnd lastly, the President will continue to meet with candidates for FBI director this afternoon. He'll meet with four more -- Andrew McCabe, Frank Keating, Richard McFeely, and Joe Lieberman. So those will all happen upon return to the White House this afternoon.\nAnd then, again, obviously, I mentioned yesterday that there will be some additional logistical guidance that will be given to the press, both to the pool and to the traveling members of the\n-- the traveling journalists, as far as logistics and questions later tonight. I think the time has been provided on the guidance. If it hasn't, it will be updated. But we're looking -- I'm sorry, I've been out with you guys -- but there will be an opportunity I think to make sure that both with the pool and with members that are planning on traveling, just some off-the-record guidance in terms of timing and other movements that will occur, and events.\nSo with that, I'll take a few.\nQ Sean, does the President support former Director Comey testifying before Congress about his recollection of their conversations and the investigation, and would he be willing to waive executive privilege about their conversations to allow them to discuss fully the nature of those conversations?\nMR. SPICER: The President wants the -- is confident that the -- in the events that he has maintained, and the truth will\n-- he wants the truth and these investigations to get to the bottom of the situation.\nQ Does he support --\nMR. SPICER: There's two investigations going on in the House and Senate, and he wants to get to the bottom of this.\nQ Have you gotten a chance to look into a little bit more what took place in the meeting between the President and Comey in February? What's the President's side of this? We know that he says he did not ask about the Flynn investigation. Can you tell us more about what the President says took place at that meeting?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into -- the President has been very clear that the account that was published is not an accurate description of his -- of how the event occurred.\nQ I guess can you confirm, though --\nMR. SPICER: I think that we've made it very clear. I'm not going to give any further comment on that.\nQ So do you have any evidence to back up, like, what -- is it just that the President says that this didn't happen, this conversation didn't happen? Or is there any recording or --\nMR. SPICER: This is not -- the President has been very clear that this is not an accurate representation of that meeting.\nQ Are we just corroborating that based on his words, though? I mean, he said in a tweet about tapes last week -- are there records, transcripts of those conversations?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've been clear about that. I think we've been very -- we put out a statement regarding that.\nQ Two quick questions. Is the President considering having personal lawyers, like outside of White House counsel, in light of these kinds of allegations and things that have come up?\nMR. SPICER: If I have any updates for that at some point I'll let you know.\nQ The White House disputed some of the characterizations of the conversation the President had with the Russian Foreign Minister. It sounds like the Russian President said that their side is willing to release a transcript of the conversation. Do you support the Russians releasing a transcript of that conversation to Congress? And were you aware that they were recording the conversation?\nMR. SPICER: I think each side -- I am not aware of anything on that, I don't have any update on that. But I think we put out a statement very clearly about the President does not believe that is an accurate representation of that --\nQ If the Russians have some sort of transcript, are you willing -- would you like it made public?\nMR. SPICER: The Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor and the Deputy National Security Advisor have been very clear with their recollection of that meeting, with their account of that meeting.\nQ -- that the President spoke to Bibi Netanyahu yesterday. Can you discuss a little bit more about what they talked about? And were the specific allegations that Israel intelligence was behind the -- what he told the Russians -- was that -- did that have anything to do with it?\nMR. SPICER: That phone call was purely a logistical and trip preparation.\nQ Did they discuss the fact that the source of the intelligence that was told to the Russians --\nMR. SPICER: That was preparation.\nQ Okay. Also it seems that the President has been a bit quiet in the last 24 hours, at least on Twitter and making any public remarks outside the official events. Is there an effort to scale back events until -- or any kind of other comments about the issues that have been going on in the White House right now until he takes off on this trip?\nMR. SPICER: I think that we put out a statement last night very clear what our position was. I think there's been a lot of questions that other people have -- that are out there talking about this or that in terms of what was appropriate with respect to some of the stuff that Director Comey did or did not do. But the White House has put out a statement very clearly with our account.\nQ How concerned are you by the comments that some of the Republicans in Congress are making, saying that this is starting to approach Watergate proportions and will affect the agenda?\nMR. SPICER: -- very clear that -- the President is obviously focused on his speech that he gave today, winning widespread praise for what he talked about -- the role of the Coast Guard and the future of these young ensigns that will go out there and help defend our homeland, and obviously he's going to continue to prepare for the meeting with the President of Colombia tomorrow and looking forward to taking off on this trip.\nThank you, guys. Enjoy.\nQ Can you comment about --\nQ Can I --\nQ Can you just comment on the video --\nQ Do you have a date for the budget?\nMR. SPICER: The State Department put out a statement on that.\nQ Was the President aware of that? Did he see the video and did he --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I know the State Department has put out a statement on that.\nThanks, guys.\nEND 2:53 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-17", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

I'm very humbled by that warm introduction and very grateful for the presence of so many great Americans at this special gathering on behalf of the First Family and the President of the United States. Welcome to the White House. (Applause.)\nAnd would everyone join me in thanking the 18th Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Elaine Chao, for her distinguished career in public service? (Applause.) She is a role model for millions, and I just am so grateful to be able to welcome you here, welcome this outstanding group to the White House to join a celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. It is great to have you all here. (Applause.)\nLet me also say I was in the back room listening to another friend of mine who you heard from today and is another great member of this community, and now is the head of the Center of Medicaid and Medicare Services -- and a Hoosier -- (laughter) -- Seema Verma. Thank you so much for being here. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings from the President of the United States, President Donald Trump. And I bring the President's gratitude for all that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders do every day to enrich the life of this nation. (Applause.)\nThis room is living proof that people of Asian-Pacific descent -- from Indonesia to India, from the Solomon Islands to South Korea, from every nation in between -- you are an indispensable part of the American story, and your communities have contributed leaders like those two standing next to me in every facet of American life.\nIn addition to Secretary Chao and Seema Verma, we have a room filled today with leaders from the Asian American community and Pacific Islander communities across America. And give yourselves a round of applause for building a stronger and more prosperous America. (Applause.)\nMy wife Karen and I just traveled the Asia Pacific on President Trump's behalf last month, and throughout my trip I saw firsthand the immensely varied and vibrant cultures that call that region home. It made me all the more grateful that those cultures and their people and so many others from the continent of Asia and islands of the Pacific have come here and made such a profound impact on the United States of America.\nThat's really why we're all here today. And since 1978, when President Jimmy Carter signed a joint resolution passed by the Congress, this has been a time here at the White House where we celebrate the contribution of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders throughout the country's history. And President Donald Trump is proud to continue this tradition tonight. (Applause.)\nEarlier this month, the President issued a proclamation declaring, and I quote, that \"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have distinguished themselves\" in every area of American life. And today we honor all those who have helped to shape the nation that we love and the country that we know today.\nFor the better part of our nation's history, the people of Asia and the Pacific have come to America in search of a better life and a brighter future, and now our history books are literally filled with the names of trailblazers. And today, Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent are the fastest-growing group in America. More than 20 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders now call the United States their home, and they make a difference in the life of our nation every single day.\nIn our economies, in our churches, in our charities and our universities, in homes all across the country, communities large and small, and in government offices at every level, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are contributing every day to everything that makes America thrive and will make America great again. (Applause.)\nIt's particularly meaningful for me to be with you all today because while my people came from across the other ocean, the Atlantic Ocean -- my grandfather was an immigrant of this country. My great-grandmother, as the legend in our family remembers, walked my grandfather across the street and up a hill and looked west to the Ox Mountains in Ireland, and she said to my grandfather, who was a young man, that you need to go to America because there's a future there for you. And my grandfather went as a young man, and didn't see or speak to his mother for another 25 years. But it was extraordinary for me to literally grow up on the footstool of the American Dream. And that Irishman's brogue still rings in my ears as I expect the accents of the parents and grandparents and great-grandparents of those that are gathered here today still ring in your ears and in your hearts.\nIt's that story of America coming from the East and coming from the West, bringing the best -- our children and grandchildren here and then building a great life. That's the story of my little family, and that's the story of the families that are gathered here. And we're celebrating it tonight.\nSo let me simply say, President Trump is firmly committed to strengthening the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in the years ahead, to seeing to it that your forbears, the confidence that they had in America, becomes your reality on an increasing basis. Because your success is America's success, and this President wants you and every American, no matter the background, to accomplish more, to climb higher, to make tomorrow even better than today.\nThe truth is that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are an integral part of America's past, but they're even a bigger part of America's future. So today I say with confidence our future is bright -- brighter than ever before. For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, I know with your help, we will make America great again.\nThank you for joining us to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. And God bless you. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-05-17", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at a Reception for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month"}

You've been trained here to handle the toughest of situations, the hardest of moments, really, that you can experience, and the hardest in people's lives, and to help the weak in their hour of need. But even for the Coast Guard, this class has been exceptionally dedicated to public service.\nYou served breakfast at the local food bank every single weekday. You rebuilt a home with Habitat for Humanity. Last year, you led cadets in donating a total of 24,000 hours—a lot of time—to community service. You've done amazing work. And in the true Coast Guard fashion, you had fewer people and fewer resources, but you accomplished the objectives, and you did it with skill and with pride and, I'd like to say, under budget and ahead of schedule. We're doing a lot of that now in the United States Government. We're doing a lot of that.\nI won't talk about how much I saved you on the F-35 fighter jet. [Laughter] I won't even talk about it. Or how much we're about to save you on the Gerald Ford, the aircraft carrier. That had a little bit of an overrun problem before I got here. You know that. Still going to have an overrun problem. We came in when it was finished. [Laughter] But we're going to save some good money. And when we build the new aircraft carriers they're going to be built under budget and ahead of schedule, just remember that. That will allow us to build more.\nNow, of course, there are always a few slip-ups from time to time. You know that. For example, I understand that once or twice, First Class Cadet Bruce Kim—where's Bruce? [Laughter] Where's Bruce? Oh, Bruce, how do you do this to yourself, Bruce? [Laughter] As Regimental Parking Officer, might have accidentally caused a few tickets to be issued or a few of your cars to be booted. Bruce, what's going on with you? [Laughter]\nBut, cadets, from this day forward, we want everyone to have a clean slate in life. That includes Bruce, right? [Laughter] And so, for any oversights or small violations that might have occurred this year, as tradition demands, I hereby absolve every cadet serving restrictions for minor offensive.\nNow, Bruce—stand up once again, Bruce. [Laughter] They saved you, Bruce, because they all wanted me to do that, okay? Thank you, Bruce. Congratulations, Bruce. Now you're—everyone's the same. Good job. By the way, Bruce, don't worry about it. That's the tradition. I was forced to do that. [Laughter] You know that. Don't worry. [Laughter]\nThis is truly an amazing group of cadets that are here today for commission. You could have gone to school anywhere you wanted and with very, very few responsibilities by comparison. Instead, you chose the path of service. You chose hard work, high standards, and a very noble mission: to save lives, defend the homeland, and protect America's interests around the world. You chose the Coast Guard. Good choice. Good choice.\nYou've learned skills they don't teach at other schools right here on the grounds of this academy and also on your larger campus, the open sea. That is a large, large campus, isn't it? A beautiful campus. But the greatest lesson you've learned at this proud institution is the knowledge you've learned about yourself. It's the knowledge that each and every one of you is something very special: You are leaders.\nFrom the first stormy days of your Swab Summer to your final weeks as a first class cadet, you have been expected to take responsibility, to make decisions, and to act. And I—like all leaders, that's exactly what you have to do. You have to act, and you have to act properly. And you have to learn how to act under great, great pressure. You're all going to be under great pressure. You have to learn how to respond and to act under great pressure.\nJust days from now, you will put this vital skill into the service of your ships, your sectors, and your country. You'll serve as deck watch officers on our amazing Coast Guard cutters. You'll bring law and order to the dangerous waters as boating officers. You will block illegal shipments of cash, weapons, and drugs. You will battle the scourge of human trafficking, something that people haven't been talking about. One of the big, big plagues of the world—not our country only—the world: human trafficking.\nAmericans will place their trust in your leadership, just as they have trusted in generations of Coast Guard men and women, with respect for your skill, with awe at your courage, and with the knowledge that you will always be ready. You are \"Always Ready.\"\nNot only will our citizens trust in your leadership, your commanders will trust you as well. The Coast Guard is the gold standard in delegating decisionmaking down to chain command. So just as your instructors have at the academy, your Coast Guard commanders will explain their vision, and then they will trust you to get the job done. Just like I, as your President, will also trust you to get the job done.\nIt's amazing to think of the adventures that are about to begin for you. Across the country this month, millions of other students are graduating high school, college. Many others are wondering, just what am I going to do? They're saying to themselves, what are they going to do? You know what you're going to do. Many, many students are graduating from college right now. They're saying, what am I going to do? Where am I going to go to work? You know it. You picked a good one, by the way. You picked a beautiful one, a good one, and we're really proud to have you, I can tell you.\nYears from now, some of them may look back and ask themselves whether they've made the right choice, whether they've made the most of the opportunities they've been given. In the Coast Guard, you will face many challenges and many threats, but one thing you will never have to face is that question of, what will I do? When you look back, you won't doubt. You know exactly how you spent your time: saving lives.\nI look at your admirals, I look at General Kelly, I look at some of the great people in service, and I want to tell you, they're excited about life. They love what they do. They love the country. They love protecting our country, and they love what they do. Is that right? Good. I didn't think anyone was going to say no. What would—[laughter]? That would have ruined our speech, right? [Laughter] They're great people.\nYou always know just what you'll be: the leaders and officers of the United States Coast Guard.\nAnd when they see your uniform, everyone in the world will know exactly what that means. What standard—and really if you think of it, when you talk about the great sailors, and the great sailors of the world, we have them. But what stranded sailor doesn't feel relief when those red racing stripes break the horizon? What drifting soul at sea, with only a short time left to live, doesn't rejoice at the sound of those chopper blades overhead, coming back and coming down to rescue them from death? What poison-peddling drug runner, the scourge of our country, doesn't tremble with fear when the might of the Coast Guard comes bearing down on them? In each case, we know the reason: America's lifesaving service is on the way. The Coast Guard is truly vital to the United States Armed Forces and truly vital to our great country.\nOut of the five branches of our Armed Services, it's only the Coast Guard that has the power to break through 21 feet of rock-solid Arctic ice, right? You're the only ones. And I'm proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years. We're going to build many of them. We need them. We need them. The Coast Guard stands watch at our ports, patrols our waterways, and protects our infrastructure. You defend America in a world of massive and very grave threats. Soon, some of you will be leading boardings of suspicious vessels, searching for the most deadly weapons, and detaining criminals to keep our people safe. Others of you will work with partners in scores of countries around the globe, bringing in the full power of the United States Coast Guard right up to those distant shores. And some of those shores are very far away.\nTo secure our borders from drug cartels, human smugglers, and terrorist threats, Coast Guard Cutters patrol more than 1,500 miles below our southern border. A lot of people didn't know that. When enormous pride hits your heart, you realize that it's with this great skill and tremendous speed, our Coast Guard men and women interdict dangerous criminals and billions and billions of dollars' worth of illegal narcotics every single year. Your helicopters launch from the decks of world-class national security cutters, and they chase drug smugglers at speeds far in excess of 50 knots.\nIn rough seas, at high speeds, our incredible Coast Guard snipers take their aim at the smugglers' engines. And time after time, they take out the motors on the first shot. They don't like wasting the bullets, right? [Laughter] They actually don't. Your slice through roaring storms, and through pouring rain and crashing waves is a place where few other people will ever venture—exciting. Exciting. But you have to have it in your heart. You have to love it. And you love it.\nIn the Coast Guard, you don't run from danger, you chase it. And you are deployed in support of operations in theaters of conflict all around the world. But not only do you defend American security, you also protect American prosperity. It's a mission that goes back to the earliest days of the Revenue Cutter Service. You've read about that and studied that.\nToday, the Coast Guard helps keep our waters open for Americans to do business. It keeps our rivers flowing with commerce. And it keeps our ports churning with American exports. You help billions and billions of dollars in goods to navigate our country every day. You are the only Federal presence on our inland waterways. You police the arteries we need to rebuild this country and to bring prosperity back to our heartland. And we are becoming very, very prosperous again. You can see that.\nThink of the glorious mission that awaits. You will secure our harbors, our waterways, and our borders. You will partner with our allies to advance our security interests at home and abroad. And you will pursue the terrorists, you will stop the drug smugglers, and you will seek to keep out all who would do harm to our country, all who can never, ever love our country. Together, we have the same mission, and your devotion and dedication makes me truly proud to be your Commander in Chief. [Applause] Thank you.\nNow, I want to take this opportunity to give you some advice. Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted. But you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never, ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine.\nLook at the way I've been treated lately—[laughter]—especially by the media. No politician in history—and I say this with great surety—has been treated worse or more unfairly. You can't let them get you down. You can't let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams. I guess that's why I won.\nAudience member. We love you—[inaudible]. The President. Thank you. I guess that's why we won.\nAdversity makes you stronger. Don't give in. Don't back down. And never stop doing what you know is right. Nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. And the more righteous your fight, the more opposition that you will face.\nI've accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time as President. Jobs are pouring back in to our country: a brandnew Supreme Court Justice, who's going to be fantastic for 45 years; a historic investment in our military; border crossings—thank you to our General—are down more than 70 percent in just a short period of time—a total record, by the way, by a lot. We've saved the Second Amendment, expanded service for our veterans—we are going to take care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before.\nI've loosened up the strangling environmental chains wrapped around our country and our economy, chains so tight that you couldn't do anything—that jobs were going down. We were losing business. We're loosening it up. We've begun plans and preparations for the border wall, which is going along very, very well. We're working on major tax cuts for all. We are going to give you the largest tax cut in the history of our country if we get it the way we want it, and we're going to give you major tax reform. And we're also getting closer and closer, day by day, to great health care for our citizens.\nAnd we are setting the stage right now for many, many more things to come. And the people understand what I'm doing, and that's the most important thing. I didn't get elected to serve the Washington media or special interests. I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women of our country, and that's what I'm doing. I will never stop fighting for you, and I will never stop fighting for the American people.\nAs you leave this academy to embark on your exciting new voyage, I am heading on a very crucial journey as well. In a few days, I will make my first trip abroad as President. With the safety, security, and interests of the American people as my priority, I will strengthen old friendships and will seek new partners, but partners who also help us—not partners who take and take and take, partners who help—and partners who help pay for whatever we are doing and all of the good we're doing for them, which is something that a lot of people have not gotten used to, and they just can't get used to it. I say, get used to it, folks. I'll ask them to unite for a future of peace and opposition [opportunity]* for our peoples and the peoples of the world.\nFirst, in Saudi Arabia, where I'll speak with Muslim leaders and challenge them to fight hatred and extremism and embrace a peaceful future for their faith. And they're looking very much forward to hearing what we—as your representative—we have to say. We have to stop radical Islamic terrorism.\nThen, in Israel, I'll reaffirm our unbreakable alliance with the Jewish state. In Rome, I will talk with Pope Francis about the contributions of Christian teachings to the world. Finally, I'll attend the NATO summit in Brussels and the G-7 in Sicily to promote security, prosperity, and peace all over the world.\nI'll meet scores of leader and honor the holiest sites of these three great religions. And everywhere I go, I will carry the inspiration I take from you each day, from your courage and determination to do whatever is required: save and protect American lives. Save and protect American lives. We want security. You're going to give us security. In just one example, we see how priceless that gift of life is to the people you touch every day. A few years ago, a Coast Guard helicopter and rescue swimmer took off in the direction of three terrified fishermen who clung to their sinking and burning vessel. That day, our Coast Guard heroes did their jobs well. They flew over the sea, despite tremendous danger, and extended a helping hand at the moment it was most urgently needed. There was very little time left.\nBut that's not the most remarkable part of that story. As one Coast Guard swimmer put it, you do that stuff all the time. You do it every hour of the day. Something is happening all the time with the United States Coast Guard. You do an amazing job. A remarkable thing happened with that rescue, but when you think of it, you do those rescues all the time. There, the Vietnamese fishing captain grabbed the swimmer's hand. He looked at his Coast Guard rescuer in the eye and said: \"I was asking God to please let me live. . . . I need to see my kids. Please, God, please, let me live so that I can see my kids. Then God sent me you.\" That's what he said.\nTo every new officer, and to every new Coast Guard member here today, or out protecting life around the world on some of the roughest waters anywhere, you truly are doing God's work. What a grateful heart you must all have. Because it is with my very grateful heart and America's cheers for the Coast Guard—and America cheers for you often—that we wish you good luck.\nAs your Commander in Chief, I thank you. I salute you. And I, once again, congratulate the Coast Guard Class of 2017. God bless you. God bless the Coast Guard. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Good luck. Enjoy your life.

Thank you all for that warm welcome.\nAnd on behalf of President Trump, let me just say thank you to Tom Donohue for your decades of tireless advocacy for business in America. Would you all join me in showing your appreciation for Tom Donohue's years of leadership for American free enterprise? (Applause.)\nIt's an honor for me to be back at the United States Chamber of Commerce, the leading voice for American industry for more than 100 years, and to have the privilege to participate in this Invest in America Summit.\nI bring greetings this morning from a champion of American workers and of American free enterprise -- the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nFrom the very first day of this administration, President Trump has been fighting to restore jobs and opportunities for the forgotten men and women of this country.\nAnd whatever Washington, D.C. may be focused on at any given time, rest assured, President Donald Trump will never stop fighting for the issues that matter most to the American people -- good jobs, safe streets, and a boundless American future. (Applause.)\nBut I'm here today with a very specific message to all of those that are gathered here, on behalf of the President, it's my pleasure to announce: America is open for business. (Applause.)\nIt's great to be with you all today. I'm especially honored to be joined by two friends who were job creators in their prior life and now they're leading two of the great states of America -- Governor Doug Ducey and Governor Matt Bevin of Arizona and Kentucky respectively. Thank you for being with us today. Thanks for being such great, great leaders. (Applause.)\nI'm also grateful to have with us so many American and international business leaders, and representatives of nearly 40 nations across the wider world. On behalf of President Trump and the American people, thank you for all that each of you do to strengthen the bonds of commerce and friendship between our land and yours.\nFrom factories to finance, from real estate to retail, your nations, your businesses recognize that investing in America means investing in success -- for you and for us.\nAnd as you know, placing a bet on America is really no bet at all. It's a prudent, safe, and smart decision, and one that will reap rewards for many years to come.\nThe advantages of investing in the American economy are really too numerous to count. They include our unparalleled system of capital, the quality and caliber of our workforce, and, of course, the entrepreneurial spirit that fuels the economic engine of the most powerful economy in the world.\nFor all these reasons, and so many more, today foreign direct investment in America tops a stunning $3.1 trillion. No other nation in the world even comes close.\nThe benefits of foreign investment, either from firms headquartered overseas or in domestic businesses with majority foreign ownership, are felt in American communities large and small.\nYou know I saw it firsthand, as Tom mentioned, back when I was Governor of the state of Indiana. My former Secretary of Commerce, Victor Smith, is with us here today, and he can attest that foreign investment means jobs and opportunities for people all across our state and all across America.\nIn our case in 2014, over 170,000 Hoosiers worked at foreign-owned companies, and the billions of dollars invested in our economy by international businesses contributed to Indiana's reputation as a great place to live and work and raise a family.\nThe truth is America as a whole is better off.\nAll told, foreign investment is responsible for more than 6.3 million American jobs -- $57 billion in research and development in every field and industry and $425 billion in annual American exports.\nSo let me just say on behalf of President Trump, thank you to all of the nations that are represented here for your businesses playing such an indispensable role in the prosperity of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nYour investment in our nation is vital to the American people, and ultimately it's a win-win for both of us. But we're here today because the truth is that we have a tremendous opportunity for growth in America.\nAnd rest assured, President Donald Trump is firmly committed to renewing America's reputation as the best place in the world to make an investment and the premier investment destination on Earth.\nSince day one, President Trump has taken decisive action to strengthen the American economy and extend our competitive edge. This President has signed more bills to slash red tape than any President in American history. Before this administration, only one President had ever signed a Congressional Review Act measure -- President Trump has already used that legislation 14 different times.\nHe's used what is known as the Congressional Review Act to repeal overreaching, unnecessary, and harmful regulations ranging from the Department of the Interior, the Department of Labor, the SEC, the Federal Communications Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and more. It's been a restoration of common sense in regulations in America.\nAnd beyond that legislation, President Trump has ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on American businesses and American free enterprise. (Applause.)\nOverall, this President has already eliminated rules and mandates that would have cost our economy as much as $18 billion every single year. And the President's leadership doesn't start there.\nHe's been rolling back the ban on offshore drilling. He's put the Clean Power Plan on a path to extinction. President Trump recently approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines what will create thousands of American jobs and strengthen America's energy future. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump is keeping his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, and to end its burden on businesses and give the American people finally the quality of healthcare that they deserve.\nThe President's leadership has made a tremendous impact on our economy, and we're just getting started.\nSince the start of this year, businesses from across this country and across the wider world have created more than 700,000 American jobs. Company after company all across this nation are making record investments in American workers and in America's future -- billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs.\nThis represents nothing short than a vote of confidence in the President's agenda. And make no mistake about it, we've only just begun.\nIf you take nothing else from what I say today, know this: President Donald Trump is committed to signing the most significant and consequential tax relief in American history, releasing the boundless potential of the American economy. (Applause.)\nAs Secretary Mnuchin said just a few weeks back, the President's plan will strengthen the American economy and create untold opportunities of investment from across the wider world.\nWe're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We're also going to put more money in the American people's pockets -- and make the tax code simpler, flatter, and fairer for everyone.\nBut when it comes to business, like all of you gathered here, President Trump's tax plan will give you more incentive to invest in America than ever before. Our administration under President Trump's leadership is going to fight to cut the corporate tax rate in America to 15 percent and make America competitive -- American businesses competitive again with businesses all over the world. (Applause.)\nHe'll end the outdated policy of worldwide taxation and enact a territorial system in its place. And President Trump will make sure that our businesses can finally bring back the trillions of dollars that are locked overseas and invest them in American workers and America's future.\nThe bottom line is that President Trump's tax plan will strengthen our economy and strengthen our reputation as the best place to invest and the best place to do business anywhere in the world.\nThe same is true of the rest of our agenda. In case you hadn't noticed, the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States, and President Donald Trump is going to rebuild the infrastructure of America. (Applause.)\nThe President is committed to make historic investments in our infrastructure to ensure that our businesses and yours have the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports, and the best future possible.\nThe truth is that every dollar we invest in infrastructure is a dollar we invest in America's future, and we look forward to leveraging the expertise of other nations, including many of you here today. We have much to learn from one another in areas we can work together to strengthen the infrastructure of this great nation and our great economy.\nAnd President Trump, I can assure you, has a deep appreciation for the role that international trade plays in enriching the American economy and opening doors of opportunity to the American people.\nBut as the President has made clear, too many of America's established trade relationships don't fulfill the stated goal of being a win-win agreement for both sides. In fact, in far too many cases, as the President has observed, America has been on the losing side of its trade deals.\nThe President has placed a high priority on fostering trade relationships that are free and fair; trade relationships that don't work for one party simply don't work at all.\nAnd under the President's leadership, our administration will continue to work with all of our trading partners on a bilateral basis to roll back the policies that put American businesses at a disadvantage. We're going to work to break down barriers to investment. We're going to work to create a truly level playing field for companies on both sides so we can prosper together. (Applause.)\nThe agreement announced last week between America and China is actually a model of what President Trump will continue to achieve. It opens the path to greater commerce by breaking down barriers to trade and investment in beef, biotechnology, energy, financial services, and more.\nIt was an important accomplishment. I'm confident this agreement will be the first of many -- not only with China but with nations across the wider world.\nIn fact, just last month I traveled to the Asia Pacific on the President's behalf to promote our economic relationships with South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia. And at the President's direction, together with Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, I had the privilege of announcing a new U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue.\nWe look forward to this dialogue, to seeing it progress, and to exploring ways that we can begin similar discussions with other nations around the world, including many of those gathered here.\nPresident Trump and our administration, I can assure you, will work tirelessly to ensure that our trade policies with all of trade partners are mutually beneficial and that they maximize the opportunity for investment in America.\nThanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, there simply is no better time to invest in America and no better time for you to attend this summit.\nOur President has already taken decisive action to renew America's promise as a land of opportunity and prosperity. And in the days and weeks ahead, we will continue to work tirelessly to enact our agenda to make the strongest economy in the world stronger still.\nSo today I say with confidence that with your continued help, with your innovation and with your industry, the companies that are represented here today, along with the leadership of President Donald Trump, I know the best days for America and all of her friends across the world are yet to come.\nThank you. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America.

Thank you very much. It is a great pleasure to welcome President Santos to the White House. Colombia is one of our closest allies in the hemisphere, and today we reaffirm partnership between our two great nations.\nPresident Santos and I had a very productive meeting, and we will continue to work very closely together to bring peace, safety, and prosperity to the hemisphere. Perhaps no area is really more important in terms of cooperation than our joint effort to end the terrible drug crimes that plague both of our countries.\nRecently, we have seen an alarmed—and I mean really a very highly alarmed and alarming trend. Last year, Colombia coca cultivation and cocaine production reached a record high, which, hopefully, will be remedied very quickly by the President. We must confront this dangerous threat to our societies together.\nToday I affirmed the United States willingness to assist Colombia's strategy to target and eliminate drug trafficking networks, illicit financings, coca cultivation, and cocaine production, of which there is far too much. The drug epidemic is poisoning too many American lives, and we're going to stop it many different ways. One of them will be the wall.\nMy administration is committed to keeping drugs and gangs from pouring into our country. Already, border crossings are down more than 73 percent. Secretary Kelly is with us; he's done a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And in short, we have a tremendous group of people working with us in terms of ICE, the ICE patrol and the Border Patrol agents. They've done a fantastic job, and I'd like you to give them my highest compliments, Mr. Secretary.\nAnd MS-13, likewise—a horrible, horrible, large group of gangs that have been let into our country over a fairly short period of time—are being decimated by the Border Patrol, by ICE, and by our incredible local police forces. And they are getting out of our country or, in some cases, going directly into prisons throughout our country. But they've literally taken over towns and cities of the United States. They will be gone very quickly.\nI look forward to working with President Santos as we target drug trafficking. Both the United States and Colombia have strong law enforcement and security relationship. We've had it and especially over the last fairly short period of time. Together, we will continue to fight the criminal networks responsible for the deadly drug trade that our people have a really strong commitment to getting rid of, because they want a much brighter future.\nPresident Santos and I also discussed the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and it is really in a very bad state, as you see and as we all see through the media. The stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere, and America stands with all of the people in our great hemisphere yearning to be free. We will be working with Colombia and other countries on the Venezuelan problem. It is a very, very horrible problem. And from a humanitarian standpoint, it is like nothing we've seen in quite a long time. The United States and Colombia are also strong economic partners, and we will continue to pursue trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. The nations' common goals of protecting our citizens, expanding opportunity, and confronting the drug crisis will improve the lives of our people and many throughout the region.\nSo many people are being so horribly affected by what's going on in terms of violence and in terms of drugs, and we're going to take care of the situation. And we've both agreed to take care of it strongly and quickly.\nPresident Santos, it was an honor to meet with you and your entire group of representatives, very talented people indeed, who have been working with us and my representatives. And I look forward to many more productive meetings, such as the one we just had. I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House, being our guest. And I'd like to congratulate you on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. That's a very great achievement. Thank you very much.\nPresident Santos. Mr. President, I want to thank you personally for this warm and productive visit and for the strong support Colombia has received from your administration, from Congress, and from the American people.\n[At this point, President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Santos. As you know, our nations have had for a long time a strategic alliance and extraordinary friendship. We believe in the same principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. And we work so that the Western Hemisphere can be more prosperous and safe.\nThe United States and Colombia, they're both democracies of greater—of longer standing in the hemisphere, we have supported each other. Our soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder in the Korean war. At the request of the United States, we sent antidrug experts to Afghanistan. And today, Colombia and the United States are working together to support Central America in their fight against drug cartels and the violence of organized crime.\nI can say, Mr. President, based on our conversation this afternoon, that I have no doubt that the United States and Colombia continue to be, today, more than ever, a support, one for the other. Our alliance was strengthened. Our most valuable cooperation has been Plan Colombia, which I can sum up in very simple terms.\nWhen Colombians were fighting to survive—for our democracy to survive, actually—faced with the threat of terrorism and drug trafficking, the United States stretched out a hand and helped us win that battle. We will never forget it.\nToday, we live in a different country. Today, Colombia is a more peaceful society, a more modern and a fairer society. In November last year, we ended the longest and last armed conflict existing in our hemisphere. The guerilla is putting down weapons at this precise time to the United Nations. Insecurity has gone down significantly. Today, we have the lowest levels of violence of the last 40 years.\nAt the same time, we have had significant progress for our citizens on issues such as education, housing, health, and social services. Millions of Colombians have been lifted out of poverty. Today, we continue next to you as partners in Peace Colombia to consolidate peace in the most affected areas. With the robust support of your Government, we are removing thousands of antipersonnel mines that murdered and mutilated children, women, and soldiers. We are healing the wounds of our victims, and we are embarking on a big social development program.\nSuch as we said today, we are working with your administration to take advantage of the unique opportunity peace offers so as to reduce permanently the production of coca leaf in Colombia and fight more effectively the other links in drug trafficking, including consumption. We must continue and deepen the fight against organized crime, transnational crime responsible not just for drug trafficking, but also for human trafficking and illegal mining.\nOur shared agenda, framed within a high-level dialogue that we Colombians value so much, includes cooperation which has allowed us to have unprecedented progress towards quality education for everyone. And this is a priority in the policies of my Government, and we wish to do more with regards to innovation and technology.\nWith the active participation of the private sector, we have reached trade agreements, investment agreements that are mutually beneficial. This morning we established the entrepreneurial council between the United States and Colombia. We are and wish to continue to be the best destination in Latin America for American businesses. Colombia will continue to be very proudly a close friend and a strategic ally of the United States.\nDear President Trump, I hope you can visit us soon so that you can personally witness the transformation underway in our country. I hope to be able to welcome you to a Colombia in peace, a more equitable Colombia, a better educated Colombia that you have so much contributed to.\nThank you so much.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. Does anybody have any questions? [Laughter] I'm shocked.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], go ahead.\nQ. Mr. President, thank you very much.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nRussia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Job Creation and Growth/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\nQ. I'd like to get your—Mr. President, I'd like to get your reaction to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's decision to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the Russia—Russian interference in the campaign. Was this the right move, or is this part of a \"witch hunt\"?\nPresident Trump. Well, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself—and the Russians, zero.\nI think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things. So I can tell you that we want to bring this great country of ours together, Jon. And I will also say very strongly, we've had tremendous success. You look at our job numbers, you look at what's going on at the border, as we discussed before; if you look at what will be happening—you're going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation. The numbers are staggering, how successful they've been, the military has been. Tomorrow, as you know, I'm going to Saudi Arabia, going to Israel. I'm going to Rome. And we have the G-7. We have a lot of great things going on.\nSo I hate to see anything that divides. I'm fine with whatever people want to do, but we have to get back to running this country really, really well. We've made tremendous progress in the last hundred-some-odd days. Tremendous progress. And you see job numbers; you see all of the production that's starting. Plants starting to open again. Haven't been open in years. I'm very proud of it. That's what I want to be focused on. Because, believe me, there's no collusion. Russia is fine. But whether it's Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America.\nSo thank you very much.\nPresident Santos. [Inaudible]\nVenezuela\n[A reporter spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nQ. President Trump, President Santos, can we say that today we are setting a new roadmap in the relationship between Colombia and the United States? Which are the concrete commitments? You were talking about the postconflict time. Many funds are needed for that.\nAnd on the issue of Venezuela, President Trump, many deaths, human rights violations. There's plenty to be done.\nPresident Trump. Well, that's true. Venezuela is a very, very serious problem. We haven't really seen a problem like that, I would say, Mr. President, in decades, in terms of the kind of violence that we're witnessing. The President was telling me—and I knew—that Venezuela was a very, very wealthy country, just about the wealthiest in your neck of the woods, and had tremendous strengths in so many different ways. And now it's poverty stricken. People don't have enough to eat. People have no food. There's great violence. And we will do whatever is necessary—and we'll work together to do whatever is necessary—to help with fixing that. And I'm really talking on a humanitarian level.\nWhen you look at the oil reserves that they have, when you look at the potential wealth that Venezuela has, you sort of have to wonder, why is that happening? How is that possible? But it's been unbelievably poorly run for a long period of time. And hopefully, that will change, and they can use those assets for the good and to take care of their people. Because right now what's happening is really a disgrace to humanity.\nAnd, Jon, I think you also had a question for the President, if you'd like to.\nQ. Does he have another one?\n[President Santos spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nPresident Santos. I answered his question about the commitment.\n[President Santos continued in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Santos. The commitment on President Trump's side and his administration was shown through the approval of the budget that, for Colombia, means an increase in the support to fund the postconflict era. Last night we received from a very important organization, The Atlantic Council, a report, which includes both parties presided by a Republican Senator and a Democrat Senator with a roadmap recommending the governments of the United States and Colombia to follow.\nThis morning we established this entrepreneurial council, United States-Colombia, so that the private sector can also have a voice in that roadmap. This means we are working together on every front that can be convenient for both countries. But we'll continue to work together. We have ratified that commitment today during our conversation.\nAnd as I said before, we have the best of relations with the United States. We are strategic allies in the region, and we will continue to be so.\nMexico-U.S. Border Security\nMr. Karl. Thank you, Mr. President. President Santos, to you, you heard President Trump say that critical to stopping the flow of drugs into the United States will be the wall that he wants to build on the Mexican border. Do you agree with him? Would that wall be a step, a positive step and a step towards reducing the flow of drugs across the border?\n[President Santos spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Santos. I believe that the best way to fight the drug trafficking is by collaborating. This is not a problem of Colombia only or a problem of the United States only, it's a world problem. And we have to all work together. We declared the war on drugs 40 years ago. The world declared the war on drugs. And it's a war that has not been won. So we must be more effective and more efficient.\nNow, we are doing a very big effort, because of the peace process, to have a new strategy: carrot and stick. Stick, by forced eradication. We have already eradicated, this year only, 15,000 hectares, which is the whole volume that we eradicated last year. And we're starting to eradicate—to substitute voluntarily, through a program where the peasants—and we have 80,000 families already in the program—that they are going to substitute for legal crops. And this is the first time that this could be done because of the peace. Before, the conflict did not allow us to build roads and to give these peasants an alternative. Now we have. So we have to take advantage of this opportunity and continue reducing the production of coca.\nIn the meantime, we will work together, the U.S. and Colombia, with other countries—Central America—to fight the other links of the chain, the intermediaries. We have destroyed 22,000 laboratories in the Colombian jungles, seizing the cocaine in the transit. We have seized record amount of tons last year, and this year, we're doing even better than last year.\nSo by working together, we can be much more effective, and that is the commitment we just made or ratified this afternoon.\nPresident Trump. And that was a long and very diplomatic answer to your question. [Laughter] I will say it a little bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel. They work. Believe me, they work. And we have no choice.\nPeter Baker [New York Times]. Yes.\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. In the light of a very busy news week, a lot of people would like to get to the bottom of a couple of things, give you a chance to go on record here. Did you at any time urge former FBI Director James Comey in any way, shape, or form to close or to back down the investigation into Michael Flynn?\nAnd also as you look back——\nPresident Trump. No. No. Next question. [Laughter]\nInvestigation of Russia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr./Health Care Reform/Job Creation and Growth\nQ. Next question. As you look back over the past 6 months or year, have you had any recollection where you've wondered if anything you have done has been something that might be worthy of criminal charges in these investigations or impeachment, as some on the left are implying?\nPresident Trump. I think it's totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. And again, we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We've done a fantastic job. We have a tremendous group of people. Millions and millions of people out there that are looking at what you had just said and said, \"What are they doing?\"\nDirector Comey was very unpopular with most people. I actually thought when I made that decision—and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. But when I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision, because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side—not only the Republican side—that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.\nThen, he had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance, so poor, in fact, that I believe—and you'd have to ask him, because I don't like to speak for other people—but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.\nAnd then, on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made. And I thought that was something that was terrible.\nWe need a great Director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It's special. All over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special. The FBI has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say—directly or indirectly—with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.\nWe're going to have a Director who is going to be outstanding. I'll be announcing that director very soon, and I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very thrilled.\nAnd just in concluding, we look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that when we go for the jobs, we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we've been pushing so hard and so successfully, including health care—because Obamacare is collapsing. It's dead; it's gone. There's nothing to compare anything to because we don't have health care in this country. You just look at what's happening. Aetna just pulled out. Other insurance companies are pulling out. We don't have health care. Obamacare is a fallacy. It's gone. We need health care. We need to cut taxes. We're going to cut taxes. Forget what I want; it will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our Nation. And that's what I want. It's going to bring back companies. It's going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies to countries that are not so far from you, Mr. President—they're very close to you, actually—and to many other places throughout the world. We're going to change that. We're going to have expansion.\nWe already do. You look at what's happening with Ford and with General Motors in Michigan and Ohio. You look at the tremendous number of jobs that are being announced in so many different fields. That's what I'm proud of, and that's what we want to focus our energy on.\nThe other is something I can only tell you: There was no collusion. And everybody—even my enemies have said, there is no collusion.\nSo we want to get back and keep on the track that we're on. Because the track that we're on is record setting, and that's what we want to do, is we want to break very positive records.\nThank you. You could ask a question.\nPresident Santos. Ricardo.\n[President Santos spoke in English as follows.]\nOh, sorry, you have another question?\nMr. Baker. For you—yes, sir, Mr. President. My question is, as someone who led a nation that's really done a lot of rebuilding and had to rebound from an epidemic of crime and drugs over quite a many years, what do you make of Mr. Trump's America first policy? And further, you've had a tough time with conservative radio, sometimes been called a punching bag. And you've said you have to persevere. I'm curious if you've given any advice to President Trump on how to do so.\n[President Santos spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Santos. I don't think I'm in a position to give any advice to President Trump. He can take care of himself. [Laughter]\nAnd what I—what we did in Colombia, you quite rightly mentioned it, is persevere. We—when you know your port of destination and we know—you know that you're doing the correct thing, you simply have to persevere. And that's what we've done in Colombia, and that's why we were on the verge of being a failed state some years ago. And now we're one of the stars of the region. And that's through hard work, perseverance, and clarity of your objectives. And that's what we have done, and we have to continue, because the trip is not over.\nRicardo Ávila [Portafolio].\nColombian Peace Agreement/Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Insurgent Group\n[A reporter spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nQ. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about trade. You're about to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. And Colombia—and like other countries in the hemisphere—has a large trade deficit with the United States. Are you worried about the fact that that could contribute to increasing that trade deficit? [The reporter continued in English as follows.]\nPresident Trump, what is your position on the peace process in Colombia?\nPresident Trump. Well, it's been a long process, and it's been a great thing to watch in the sense that the President did a fantastic job. That's not easy after so many years of war. So I'm very, very proud to get to know you, and I really congratulate you. There's nothing tougher than peace, and we want to make peace all over the world. And you are really a great example of somebody that started it.\nI mean, FARC is—that was a long, tough situation, as you know very well, coming from the country. But I think the President has done a magnificent job. Not easy. But he's done a magnificent job.\n[President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Santos. Clearer impossible. [Laughter]\nOn the trade issue, our deficit with the United States is not so large. It is a moderate deficit, which, of course, both countries will try to increase the volume of trade in both directions and investments also in both directions.\nColombia is becoming an important investor here in the United States, and this is something not many people know. But we have considerable investments in the United States.\nWe have attempted to give dynamism to these flows of trade, of investment, getting together those main players who are the investors in the private sector. I believe the foundations have been laid. We have the free trade agreement, which is working well. The number of Colombian businesses that are exporting to the United States has grown. And we both believe that we can take greater advantage of those agreements in order to increase flows in both directions for the benefit both of the Colombian and American peoples.\nPresident Trump.

I will be visiting with the leaders in many different countries to strengthen our old friendships, build new partnerships, and unite the civilized world in a fight against terrorism.\nIn that spirit of unity, I will travel to lands associated with three of the world's great religions. My first stop will be Saudi Arabia, the heart of the Muslim world. There I will address a historic gathering of the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations. I will represent the views of the American people frankly and clearly.\nMany of these leaders have expressed growing concern about terrorism, the spread of radicalization, and Iran's role in funding both. Now it appears Muslim leaders are ready to take more responsibility and a much bigger role in fighting terrorism in their region. It's about time we do it, we'll do it together, but it has to be done. America cannot solve all of the world's problems, but we can—and we must—help any nation willing to join in the common cause of eradicating terrorism from the face of the earth.\nNext, I'll travel to the ancient city of Jerusalem to talk with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, about bringing peace and prosperity to both our nations. Israel is an important American ally, but in recent years, we haven't always treated them that way. It's time to renew our friendship.\nWhile I'm there, I'll also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem to discuss ways to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\nFrom there, I'll head to the Vatican, where I will have the great honor of an audience with Pope Francis. I look forward to speaking with the Pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace.\nI will also meet with friends and allies in Europe at a gathering of NATO in Brussels and at the G-7 summit in Italy. Finally, I will close my trip by saying thank you to some of the courageous men and women of the United State military serving their nation overseas.\nIn my Inaugural Address, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, to seek new partners in pursuit of peace, and above all, to always put American people first.\nI also pledged that our partners must show that they're partners, they must show that they're friends, and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost. The money that we're spending is so big, it's so much, and it's not fair for our Nation. They have to help, and I'm sure they will. The fact is, I'm excited about new possibilities for peace and prosperity, and I hope you are too.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-05-19", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Through the hard work and dedication of these career and volunteer first responders, Americans receive the finest emergency medical treatment in their most vulnerable moments. We also honor those EMS providers who have made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in the line of duty.\nDay or night, in every city, suburb, rural community, or wilderness area, our Nation relies upon EMS providers to respond to every kind of emergency situation to save lives and reduce suffering. In January, when more than 70 tornadoes touched down in Georgia and Mississippi, injuring many, EMS responders were there to help. In March, when wildfires threatened Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas, taking lives and forcing thousands from their homes, our EMS personnel were there providing urgent medical care and patient transportation. Last month, when flooding and tornadoes ravaged Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas, EMS personnel once more came to their neighbors' aid. Whether they are assisting during natural disasters or providing lifesaving care after car accidents, heart attacks, sports injuries, or violent crime, EMS personnel respond to tens of millions of requests for help each year in our country. We rest easier knowing that they stand ready to answer the call.\nOver the past 50 years, our Nation's EMS system has evolved with ever-developing medical, transportation, and communications technologies to meet the changing needs of our communities. The EMS Agenda 2050 project—a joint effort by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, and the EMS community—will help develop a vision for meeting our communities' future emergency medical services needs and improve the health of all Americans. We commend these efforts to develop innovative new treatments, advance and adapt medical skills, establish stronger professional standards, and promote public education and health. This week, we thank our EMS professionals for their sustained commitment to excellence and dedication to service, and share our hopes for a bright future that will make us all safer and healthier.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2017, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this occasion by showing their support for local EMS professionals through appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

During National Safe Boating Week, the U.S. Coast Guard and its Federal, State, and local safe boating partners encourage all boaters to explore and enjoy America's beautiful waters responsibly.\nSafe boating begins with preparation. The Coast Guard estimates that human error accounts for 70 percent of all boating accidents and that life jackets could prevent more than 80 percent of boating fatalities. Through basic boating safety procedures—carrying lifesaving emergency distress and communications equipment, wearing life jackets, attending safe boating courses, participating in free boat safety checks, and staying sober when navigating—we can help ensure boaters on America's coastal, inland, and offshore waters stay safe throughout the season.\nAmerica's diverse waterways are waiting to be explored. But before enjoying a day on the water, Americans should take time this week to familiarize themselves with safe boating practices so that everyone makes it home unharmed.\nIn recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as \"National Safe Boating Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2017, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities. I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety through events and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

During World Trade Week, we recognize the power of open markets around the world and celebrate the many benefits that fair international commerce can bring to our Nation. We also highlight the importance of expanded trade to our economic growth, and we commit to breaking down trade barriers and opening new markets for American exports.\nOpen, fair, and competitive markets increase opportunities for American workers and employers and contribute to a higher standard of living. Job creation with increased wages is a top priority of my Administration, and increasing trade—while reducing our trade deficit—is a key component of that mission. We will promote our economic growth by strengthening our manufacturing base and expanding exports in manufacturing, agriculture, and the service industries. We will also challenge unfair trade practices that leave American workers, farmers, and businesses competing in global markets at a disadvantage.\nTrade has a large role in the United States economy today, but it can be even greater. Our exports contribute $2.2 trillion, or 12 percent, to our national income, supporting 11.5 million private-sector jobs. Manufacturing exports total $1.265 trillion, behind only China and Germany. The United States leads the world in both agricultural exports, which currently total $139 billion, and services exports, at $750 billion today. The United States, however, has a large and persistent trade deficit in manufacturing, overall as well as with certain trading partners. Through an increased commitment to opening markets, reducing barriers to our goods, and firmly addressing unfair trade practices, we can do far better for American workers and manufacturers.\nMy Administration will negotiate future trade agreements that ensure that all Americans reap the benefits of global commerce. This includes small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy. While past agreements have not always accounted for the consequential effects of trade on small businesses and the American workforce, future agreements will.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2017, as World Trade Week.

On Armed Forces Day, we salute the bravery of those who defend our Nation's peace and security. Their service defends for Americans the freedom that all people deserve.\nThis year, we also reflect on the 100th anniversary of our Nation's entry into World War I. More than 4.7 million Americans would ultimately serve in the United States Armed Forces during that terrible conflict. Their sacrifice has not been forgotten. One hundred years later, we face different threats and challenges. But our safety and security, and the defense of our way of life, rest in the same able hands of our Armed Forces.\nBecause our Armed Forces must constantly adapt to new threats, our Nation is committed to ensuring they have the tools and resources they need as they train, deploy, and fight in defense of our country and defending our values. This is why my budget calls for a $54 billion increase in national defense spending.\nToday, we salute our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen for their dedication as they carry out the extraordinary duty of protecting our country. We also pay tribute to the families who serve alongside them, lending their steadfast love and support.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

We honor the proud history of our merchant mariners and their important contributions in strengthening our economy.\nAmericans have long looked to the sea as a source of safety and well-being. Bounded by two oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, and crisscrossed by inland waterways, America was destined to be a maritime nation. Our fledgling Republic expanded and became stronger, as our Nation's growing Merchant Marine connected the States and cemented ties among our new allies.\nToday, the men and women who crew ships remain essential to our Nation's prosperity and security. Those in the maritime industry, including merchant mariners, promote our economic growth, facilitating the export of more than $475 billion in goods just last year and sustaining our critical defense industrial base. Merchant mariners also actively protect our homeland, serving as our eyes and ears on the seas. They serve with distinction and courage, heading into war zones, and too often sacrificing their own lives for our protection.\nThe Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as \"National Maritime Day,\" to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship, in 1819 by the S.S.

(Applause.)\nIt's a joy to be with you today. I look out across this gathering, I see 606 men and women of accomplishment, of character, and of great promise. And it really is an honor for me to be with you all.\nToday is a day of celebration and appreciation -- especially for all of those who believed in you and saw you through, many of whom are here today: your friends, your teachers, and your wonderful families.\nNow let me say on behalf of the moms and dads here, I can attest that this ceremony is one of the proudest moments of their lives, too. I've been a governor, and now I'm Vice President of the United States, but the most important job that I will ever hold is husband and father to three wonderful kids. (Applause.)\nIn fact, she's been mentioned already, but my wife of 31 years, now the Second Lady of the United States of America, is with us today. Would you join me in welcoming Karen Pence to Grove City College? (Applause.)\nNow I mentioned before, Karen and I are the proud parents of three amazing kids -- one of whom just joined the ranks of the college graduates this last month. So I know firsthand that while today is an accomplishment for all of you in the cap and gowns, it's just as much an accomplishment for your families.\nYou're going to be able to walk across this stage -- I know you know in your heart of hearts -- because your parents and your loved ones gave you a foundation of love and education. They encouraged you, they prayed for you, and in most cases, they signed a whole lot of checks to bring you to this day.\nSo before I go one step further, Class of 2017, why don't you go ahead and stand up, turn around, catch the eye of loved ones in the crowd, just show them how thankful you really are for all the support that made this day possible, would you please?\nYou know, it's especially meaningful for me, as Vice President, to have the opportunity to address graduates of a college for more than 140 years that has fostered an identity of excellence and independence, a college that literally rose to national prominence by standing firm for the principles upon which it was founded.\nIn 1876, in the shadow of the new birth of American freedom, secured by a decade of the fires of Civil War, Grove City College was founded with a very simple mission to preserve that freedom that had been defended and wrought through \"a program of intellectual, moral, and spiritual education, capable of pushing civilization forward on every frontier.\"\nAnd to preserve its independence, history records that beginning in the beginning in the 1980s, Grove City College refused any federal funding, and defended its position before the Supreme Court of the United States of America. And to this day, Grove City College is one of only a few colleges in the United States to refuse all federal funding. (Applause.)\nSo let me say to the graduates who are here, the diploma that you will receive today was minted in an institution of principle and independence, and you can be proud of it for the rest of your lives. (Applause.)\nYou have received an education not just in facts and figures -- but in principled leadership grounded in faith and freedom.\nThose who have stood where you stand today have left this place to become leaders -- leaders in their communities, leaders in faith, in industry, and in public life. And now their legacy will become your legacy.\nAnd it hasn't been handed to you. You've earned that seat you're sitting in today. You've read the books, you passed the tests, you probably pulled a few all-nighters, and now you're ready to add your voice to the chorus that is America.\nBut as the Bible says, to whom much is given, much will be required. I believe that you leave here today with one particular responsibility, it's what I came here to tell you: You leave here with a responsibility to lead.\nAll of you, without exception, are called to be leaders no matter where you go from here. Now, some of you will walk in the fields of faith -- whether it be missions, pastoring, or counseling. Many of you will enter into technology and industry, where you will use your minds and your hands to turn dreams into reality. Some of you will choose a path of law, to uphold justice, right great wrongs, others of you may heal the sick through medicine.\nSome of you may choose a career in public life, and a brave few may step forward to protect our families and our communities in the uniform of law enforcement or the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States.\nBut while your paths may all be different, I would offer you today that the same call of leadership falls on each of your shoulders. And so to be leaders, I have a few thoughts.\nFirst, to be leaders, you must inspire those around you by being salt and light in every walk of life. Remember now, people follow people they respect. So first and foremost, you must aspire to be men and women of character.\nSecondly, servant leadership, not selfish ambition, must be the animating force of the career that lies before you. For it's written, whoever would be first of all must be servant of all.\nYour education these past four years has prepared you to lead. You hold within you all that you need to leave this place and succeed. All you need to add to it is courage.\nC.S. Lewis said memorably that, courage was not one of the virtues, it was actually a form of every virtue at the testing point.\nAnd if you aspire to lead, you'll need courage, because leadership brings both honor and opposition. Anyone who dreams big will encounter those who think small. Anyone who dares to step forward will find those who'd rather they stay put. And anyone who thinks they can will always hear from those who are sure they can't.\nYou need look no further than a friend of mine as an example of leadership and perseverance, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nSince the first day of our administration, and in the great tradition of this college, our President has been freeing the American economy by rolling back the heavy hand of big government. He's been expanding educational choice opportunities for some of our most disadvantaged children. He's been rebuilding our military, restoring safety to our streets.\nAnd I can't tell you how proud I am to be Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of life and all the God-given liberties in the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.)\nBut as the President said just about a week ago at a ceremony just like this, \"nothing worth doing ever came easy. Following your convictions,\" he added, means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the courage to do what's right.\nSo I say to all the graduates here today: Don't fear criticism. Have the humility to listen to it, learn from it, and most importantly, push through it.\nPersistence is the key. Never quit on your dreams. Dreams may be deferred, but they must never be abandoned.\nNow, let my own small life be an example to you graduates. My calling from the time I'm old enough to remember was public life. I grew up in a small town in southern Indiana. My grandfather had immigrated to this country from the land of Ireland. One of the heroes of my youth then and now was President John F. Kennedy. I got it in my head somewhere when I was a kid that if John F. Kennedy's grandfather came from Ireland, and he was able to serve in Washington, D.C., maybe someday I could too. And so I did what so many of you have done. I worked hard. I studied hard. I pursued my dreams. And when I was not much older than those of you sitting here at this graduation, I ran for public office for the first time.\nNow, President McNulty left this part out of the biography that he read. Because you see I actually ran for the Congress of the United States twice before I was elected on the third time. I ran in 19-and-88, met my second favorite President, Ronald Reagan when I was a young man and a candidate. (Applause.)\nBut I wasn't successful. I tried again, I wasn't successful again. And I looked at my young bride, who hasn't changed a bit since that day. (Laughter.) And I said to her, well, maybe that's not for us. But I never let go of that dream. I never did.\nYou're going to face challenges in the days that will unfold after this day and occasionally encounter a setback. But I want you to trust that dream that's in your heart and never let it go.\nFor Karen and me it meant going into a completely different business. It meant starting a family, starting a life. It meant really pushing on and trusting God for the path that he'd called us on. And then that dream came back around, and I had a chance to serve in that Congress, serve as governor of my state. And I stand before you today deeply humbled to serve as Vice President of the United States of America.\nSo hold on to your calling. Never let it go.\nAnother President, Calvin Coolidge, put it this way: \"Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence.\" Talent will not: Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. \"Genius will not: Unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: The world is full of educated derelicts,\" he wrote. \"Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.\"\nAnd so persistence, men and women: Hold on to your dreams and drive forward.\nFrom this day forward, to the Grove City College Class of 2017, you are called to lead fearlessly. Be men and women of integrity with a servant's heart, expect opposition and persevere, and lastly have faith.\nFor as the Good Book says, He knows the plans he has for you -- plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.\nAs you go from here today, to live your life according to the precepts and principles that you've learned here at Grove City College, strive every day to lead with courage and conviction in the places where you live and work.\nAnd in all that you do, have faith. Have faith that He that brought you this far will never leave you and never forsake you -- because He never will\nIf you hold fast to Him, to the faith that deepened in this special place, and to all that you learned from this extraordinary faculty, I know in my heart of hearts you will not only persevere, you will prevail. And I look out in the black robes at a sea of leaders that will lead your families, your professions, and our country to unimaginable heights.\nGrove City College Class of 2017, this is your day, the future is yours. Go get it.\nThank you. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.

Wright-Pat, thank you. (Applause.)\nBut thanks to all those who are stationed here -- 5,200 active duty servicemembers; 1,900 reservists. And today is your day. Since 1950, the third Saturday in the month of May has been set aside as a time for all Americans to join together and show the profound gratitude that we all feel each and every day to the men and women of our armed forces.\nAnd President Trump is proud to continue that tradition this year. In honor of Armed Forces Day, the President issued a proclamation in his words to \"salute the bravery of those who defend our nation's peace and security.\" And salute you, we do.\nToday, in communities large and small on Main Streets and meeting halls, in homes, and in hearts, and in gatherings at military bases across the nation, the American people are taking a moment to pause, to say thank you to you heroes who protect our freedom, our families, and our very way of life.\nAnd to every American that's looking on, I say if you see a member of our armed forces on Armed Forces Day, make sure you just reach out your hand and say those most deserving of words to this all-volunteer military: Thank you for your service to the United States of America. (Applause.)\nYou're part of the cord of service that stretches back into the midst of American history. In every generation, the sons and daughters of liberty from every corner of our country have answered the call of duty and answered it with courage and self-sacrifice and commitment. Their service and their sacrifice kept the flame of freedom alive in their time, and now you've stepped up and stepped forward to defend our freedom in your time.\nYou are among the rest of us, but make no mistake about it, you are the best of us. And so are all of your brothers and sisters stationed around the wider world.\nToday nearly 1.3 million Americans are serving in active duty in the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. Another 800,000 Americans stand ready in our reserves. But wherever they are at home or abroad, the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States stand stall and stand together. And you form the unbreakable backbone of American freedom. (Applause.)\nToday we recognize what you do every day, but we also recognize that you do not in many cases serve alone. So allow me to take a moment to say thank you to the family members who serve beside you, stand behind you. Let's give thanks to the families of our armed forces, especially those that are with us today. (Applause.)\nThe truth is that while our servicemembers enlist, it's a family that serves, isn't it? It's family that makes the sacrifices. And know today that the family members who are here, the spouses, the children, the grandchildren, you have the gratitude of our Commander-in-Chief and every American.\nMy wife and I know a little bit of what it's like to be in a military family. While neither of us wore the uniform, our fathers both served in the military. And we're the proud parents of a United States Marine who happens to be an aviator. So that's close the Air Force, right?\nI couldn't be more grateful as the proud parents of a member of our military to serve a President who is so dedicated to the men and women of our armed forces, their families, and our veterans. And I want to assure you, President Donald Trump is fighting tirelessly every day, and we will rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and we will once again as a nation give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training you deserve to accomplish your mission and come home safe. (Applause.)\nAnd with the strong support of President Trump and our armed forces, we'll give you the resources to accomplish that paramount mission of combating and defeating the terrorist threat to our nation in ISIS.\nAnd today because of our armed forces, I'm pleased to report ISIS is on the run, and we will not rest, we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source so you can eliminate the threat to our nation and to our allies in the years ahead. (Applause.)\nYou'll be glad to know as members of our armed forces, earlier this month, President Trump signed at $21 billion increase in funding for our armed forces. It was the biggest investment in military readiness in nearly 10 years. And President Trump is working with leaders in Congress, like those that are gathered here today. And in the coming budget that will be unveiled this next week, we're going to propose the largest increase in defense spending since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nWith the strong support that you all deserve and receive in the Congress of the United States, our President is going to make the strongest fighting force in history even stronger still. And with renewed American strength, President Trump is standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies.\nAt this very moment, President Trump is overseas renewing America's role as leader of the free world. As we speak today, the President is in Saudi Arabia, strengthening our alliances across the Arab world. In just a few days, he'll be in Israel. He'll close out his trip in Europe, where our President will reaffirm America's commitment to our treaty allies in NATO.\nPresident Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. And I know in my heart -- serving with him as I do every day -- that President Donald Trump will be the best friend the Armed Forces of America will have ever had in the White House. (Applause.)\nHe will faithfully support you just as you have faithfully stood forward to defend our nation and the precious gift of freedom.\nBut today, all of America celebrates the men and women of our armed forces. You are patriots, all. You're heroes. Not just to your families and your community, but to every American. Frankly, you're the pride of the American people, the best among us, and we're grateful one and all.\nTo wear the uniform of the United States of America plain and simple is to earn the eternal appreciation and the prayers of the American people. And be confident of this: On this Armed Forces Day, your Commander-in-Chief and every American who lives under the protection that you provide will stand up this day and simply offer a word of thanks. And we salute you for your service.\nWe pray today God's protection on you as you serve and defend this nation. May God bless you as you serve this, the greatest nation on Earth, and may God bless your families, and may God bless the United States of America.\nThank you all and happy Armed Forces Day!

To that end, both countries welcome a new period in their strategic partnership, built upon their continued trust and shared interests. Furthermore, the two nations plan to form a Strategic Joint Consultative Group, hosted by The President of the United States of America and The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques The King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or their appropriate designees, to chart the course of this strategic partnership. The Group will meet at least once a year, alternating between our two countries, and it will review areas of cooperation.\nOur two great countries share a desire to address the threats to our shared security interests. Thus, the United States of America and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seek to embark on new initiatives to counter violent extremist messaging, disrupt financing of terrorism, and advance defense cooperation. Violent extremists who threaten peace in the Middle East will find a growing group of regional partners arrayed against them, confronting their aggression and sowing the seeds of peace. The United States of America and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hope that responsible governments willing to commit to peace will build upon these efforts to realize these objectives.\nA robust, integrated regional security architecture is critical to our cooperation. The United States of America and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia intend to expand engagement with other countries in the region over the coming years and to identify new areas of cooperation. Over the course of our history, the United States of America and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have developed a productive partnership built upon trust, cooperation, and shared interests.

We are proud of you all. (Applause.)\nFor this son of Indiana, it is great to be back home again. (Applause.) But I have to tell you it's deeply humbling for me to participate in the 172nd commencement here at University of Notre Dame in her 175th year.\nMy first-generation Irish-American mother is actually with us today, 83 years young, Nancy Pence Fritsch. (Applause.) And I'm pretty sure my mother thought she'd see me at a graduation at Notre Dame. (Laughter.) Hi, Mom.\nThe Notre Dame Class of 2017 is a class of extraordinary accomplishment. You came from every corner of America and from all across the world -- representing all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and a stunning 74 foreign nations.\nSome 3,143 men and women will graduate today with 3,171 degrees. Now by my count, that difference means that we have about 28 graduates earning multiple degrees from Notre Dame today. (Applause.)\nWe have with us a two-time Olympian, two Rhodes Scholars, two Truman Scholars, 15 Fulbright Fellows, a quadruple Domer, national champions in fencing and soccer, the Indiana Campus Compact Wood Award winner -- and most impressive of all, I say with gratitude, that 38 of you will leave here and serve as officers in the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. And we thank you for your service. (Applause.)\nNow, today is a day of celebration and the sun is out. (Laughter.) It's also a day of appreciation -- especially for all those who believed in you and saw you through -- your friends, these great professors, and your wonderful families.\nOn behalf of all the moms and dads here, I can attest firsthand that this ceremony is one of the proudest moments of their lives. (Applause.)\nI've been a governor, and now I'm Vice President of the United States, but the most important job I will ever hold is that of husband and father. (Applause.) In fact, my wife of 31 years, the Second Lady of the United States of America, is also with us today. Would you join me in welcoming Karen Pence? (Applause.)\nKaren and I are the proud parents of three amazing kids -- one of them who just joined the ranks of college graduates this last month. So we know firsthand that while today is an accomplishment for all of you who are graduating, it really is just as much an accomplishment for your families. You know you have come to this point because your parents and your families gave you a foundation of love and education. They encouraged you, they prayed for you, and in most cases, they signed a whole lot of checks to make this day possible. (Laughter.)\nSo before we go one step further, Class of 2017, why don't you just stand up, turn around, catch the eye of the loved ones who are with us today, and show them just how thankful you are for all the love and support that carried you to this day? (Applause.)\nBecause of your hard work, and their support, you're graduating from an exceptional university today. My charge to all of you is simply this: Be exceptional from this day forth.\nOne-hundred and seventy-five years ago, the Reverend Edward Sorin and seven of his companions left their home in Vincennes, Indiana. They traveled north along the Wabash, through fields and forests, amid the valleys and over the hills until they reached the very ground on which we stand today.\nHere, they broke bread. They said their prayers. And in the words of Father Sorin, they established an institution with the noble mission to in their words \"become a powerful means for good.\"\nAnd so it has.\nFor 175 years, the men and women who have come before you in this place, graduated from this university have gone forth to do good. The University of Notre Dame is special. (Applause.)\nFrom the arts to engineering, from politics to prose, you have been given a strong foundation of critical thought and knowledge. You have studied the textbooks of your discipline and learned the facts and figures that you'll need to succeed in your chosen field and profession.\nBut a Notre Dame education doesn't end with the formation of the mind. In these halls, you have experienced the formation of the heart. Your education here has prepared you for a life of service to your families, your communities, and our country, and the countries to which you will return.\nNotre Dame is exceptional.\nThis university stands without apology for human freedom and the inherent dignity of every human person, and it holds fast to the faith that gave it birth.\nAnd the impact of Notre Dame reaches far beyond the sight of the Golden Dome. Your educational initiatives bring knowledge to the children across this country and the world who need it most. Your commitment to social concerns melds faith and action to overcome poverty worldwide. Your focus on ethics and culture promotes the value of all human life.\nAnd know that in so many causes, I can assure you, that in these matters you have an ally in our still-new administration. You know, the greatest honor of my life is to serve as Vice President to the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nJust as Notre Dame has stood strong to protect its religious liberty, I'm proud that this President just took steps to ensure that this university and the Little Sisters of the Poor could not be forced to violate their consciences to fully participate in American civic life. (Applause.)\nAnd just as Notre Dame has stood for those who are persecuted for their faith around the world, just a short while ago in Saudi Arabia, this President spoke out against religious persecution of all people, of all faiths. And on the world stage, he condemned, in his words, \"the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.\" (Applause.)\nAnd where this President has stood for the unalienable right to life at home and abroad, I'm so proud that the University of Notre Dame has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.)\nYour education at the University of Notre Dame has been exceptional -- but, as the Good Book says, to whom much is given, much will be required.\nSo I urge you, as the rising generation -- carry the ideals and the values that you've learned at Notre Dame into your lives and your careers.\nBe leaders in your families, in your communities, and in every field of endeavor for the values you learned here at Notre Dame. And in these divided times, I urge you to take one more aspect of the culture of this historic institution into the mainstream of American life.\nIf the emanations of free speech were charted on a map like infrared heat signatures, one would hope that universities would be the hottest places -- red and purple with dispute; not dark blue and white -- frozen into cant, orthodoxy, and intellectual stasis.\nIf such a map were to exist, Notre Dame would burn bright with the glow of vibrant discussion. This university is a vanguard of freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas at a time, sadly, when free speech and civility are waning on campuses across America.\nNotre Dame is a campus where deliberation is welcomed -- where opposing views are debated and where every speaker, no matter how unpopular or unfashionable, is afforded the right to air their views in the open for all to hear. (Applause.)\nBut Notre Dame is an exception -- an island in a sea of conformity, so far spared from the noxious wave that seems to be rushing over much of academia. While this institution has maintained an atmosphere of civility and open debate, far too many campuses across America have become characterized by speech codes, safe zones, tone policing, administration-sanctioned political correctness -- all of which amounts to nothing less than suppression of the freedom of speech. (Applause.)\nThese all-too-common practices are destructive of learning and the pursuit of knowledge. And they are wholly outside the American tradition. (Applause.)\nAs you, our youth, are the future, and universities, the bellwether of thought and culture, I would submit that the increasing intolerance and suppression of the time-honored tradition of free expression on our campuses jeopardizes the liberties of every American. This should not -- and must not -- be met with silence. (Applause.)\nA little more than two years ago, I was here when this university, this nation, and the world, bid farewell to a giant of this institution and of the 20th Century, Father Theodore Hesburgh. (Applause.)\nHis contributions as the longest-serving president of this institution are legion. But his moral example is greater still and will impact generations.\nAnd on this point of which I speak, he wrote words of admonition that I hope you will carry into the careers of consequence that unfold before you. He wrote: \"Notre Dame can and must be a crossroads where all the vital intellectual currents of our time meet in dialogue, where the great issues are plumbed to their depths, where every sincere inquirer is welcomed and listened to, where differences of culture and religion and conviction can co-exist with friendship, civility, hospitality, respect and love.\"\nFather Ted said Notre Dame was to be, as she is today, \"a place where the endless conversation is harbored and not foreclosed.\"\nAnd so I say to this rising generation: So, too, must America be in your time. (Applause.)\nSo as new graduates of this exceptional university, I urge you: Be leaders for the freedom of thought and expression. Carry the example and principles you've learned here to all the places where you will live and work.\nFrom this day forward, like the generations who have gone before for the past 175 years, the graduates of the Class of 2017, you are called to lead for good, to be men and women of integrity and values, to be salt and light in these ever-changing times. And you're called in one other way: to have faith.\nFor, as the Old Book says, He knows the plans he has for you -- plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.\nStrive every day to lead for good with courage and conviction. Live your life according to the precepts and principles that you have learned and seen here at Notre Dame.\nAnd in all that you do, have faith that He who brought you this far will never leave you, nor forsake you -- because He never will. If you hold fast to Him, to the faith that you have deepened in this place, and to all that you have learned and the examples you've seen, I know you will not only persevere, you will prevail. And you will lead your families, your professions, and our country to unimaginable heights.\nUniversity of Notre Dame Class of 2017, this is your day. So go, Irish -- the future is yours.\nThank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-05-21", "title": "Commencement Address by the Vice President at the University of Notre Dame"}

I would like to thank King Salman for his extraordinary words and the magnificent Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for hosting today's summit. I am honored to be received by such gracious hosts. I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived.\nYou also hosted me in the treasured home of King Abd al-Aziz, the founder of the Kingdom, who united your great people. Working alongside of another beloved leader, American President Franklin Roosevelt, King Abd al-Aziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. King Salman, your father would be very, very proud to see that you are continuing his legacy. And just as he opened the first chapter of our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to all of our citizens.\nLet me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours—thank you. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and to mine.\nI stand before you, as a representative of the American people, to deliver a message of friendship and hope and love. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic faith.\nIn my Inaugural Address to the American people, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust.\nOur vision is one of peace, security, and prosperity in this region and all throughout the world. Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God.\nAnd so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leaders—unique in the history of nations—is a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture, and commerce.\nFor Americans, this is a very exciting time. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country. In just a few months, we have created almost a million new jobs, added over $3 trillion in new value, lifted the burdens on American industry, and made record investments in our military that will protect the safety of our people and enhance the security of our wonderful friends and allies, many of whom are here today.\nNow, there is even more blessed news that I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King Salman, the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. Yesterday we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia. This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase, and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world. This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a far greater role in security and operations having to do with security.\nWe have also started discussions with many of the countries present today on strengthening partnerships and forming new ones to advance security and stability across the Middle East and far beyond.\nLater today we will make history again with the opening of the new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, located right here in this central part of the Islamic world. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for his strong demonstration and his absolutely incredible and powerful leadership.\nI have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you.\nAmerica is a sovereign nation, and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lecture. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership—based on shared interests and values—to pursue a better future for all of us.\nHere at this summit, we will discuss many interests that we share together. But above all, we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history's great test: to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces that terrorism brings with it every single time.\nYoung Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. When young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves, it has to be done, and we have to let them do it.\nWith God's help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East and maybe even all over the world.\nBut this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared the violent reach of terrorism. America has suffered repeated barbaric attacks, from the atrocities of September 11, to the devastation of the Boston bombings, to the horrible killings in San Bernardino and Orlando. The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and South America. India, Russia, China, and Australia have all been victims.\nBut in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim, and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim.\nWe now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure. The true toll of ISIS—if you look at what's happening—Al Qaida, Hizballah, Hamas, and so many others must be counted not only in the number of dead. It also must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams.\nThe Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity. This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock.\nSaudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world's great faiths. Each year, millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones, including soaring achievements in architecture. Egypt was a thriving center of learning and achievement thousands of years before other parts of the world. The wonders of Giza, Luxor, and Alexandria are proud monuments to that ancient heritage.\nAll over the world, people dream of walking through the ruins of Petra in Jordan. Iraq was the cradle of civilization and is a land of natural beauty. And the United Arab Emirates has reached incredible heights with glass and steel and turned earth and water into spectacular works of art.\nThe entire region is at the center of the key shipping lanes of the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz. The potential of this region has never, ever been greater. Sixty-five percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home.\nBut this untapped potential, this tremendous cause of optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it.\nEvery time a terrorist murders an innocent person and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death.\nIf we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen and what will be the end result. Terrorism's devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing, then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God.\nThis is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people, all in the name of religion. People that want to protect life and want to protect their religion. This is a battle between good and evil.\nWhen we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the strains of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims; we see only that they were children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy.\nBut we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread all across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their country, and frankly, for their families and for their children. It's a choice between two futures, and it is a choice America cannot make for you.\nA better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and drive out the extremists—drive them out. Drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your Holy Land, and drive them out of this Earth.\nFor our part, America is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not worked and will apply new approaches informed by experience, talent, and judgment. We are adopting a principled realism rooted in common values, shared interests, and common sense.\nOur friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes, not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms, not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection, and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, America seeks peace, not war.\nMuslim nations must be willing to take on the burden if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil.\nMany are already making significant contributions to regional security. Jordanian pilots are crucial partners against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and a regional coalition have taken strong action against Houthi militants in Yemen. The Lebanese Army is hunting ISIS operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. Emirati troops are supporting our Afghan partners and supporting them strongly. In Mosul, American troops are supporting Kurds, Sunnis, and Shias fighting together for their homeland. Qatar, which hosts the U.S. Central Command, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to enhance security in the region. Our courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban and others in the fight for their country.\nAs we deny terrorist organization control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let ISIS sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements.\nI am proud to announce that the nations here today will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, cochaired by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and joined by every member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It is another historic step in a day that will be long remembered.\nI also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror and for designating Hizballah as a terrorist organization—which they certainly are—last year. Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing sanctions on one of the most senior leaders of Hizballah. Of course, there is still much work to be done. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds. We must stop what they are doing to inspire, because they do nothing to inspire, but kill. And we are having a very profound effect, if you look at what's happened recently. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.\nReligious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory; piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned.\nAnd political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: Heroes don't kill innocents, they save them. Many nations here today have taken important steps to raise up that message. Saudi Arabia's \"Vision for 2030\" is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development.\nThe United Arab Emirates has also engaged in the battle for the hearts and souls and, with the United States, launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. Bahrain, too, is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism.\nI also applaud Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees living—and just living so poorly—that they're forced to leave the Middle East, depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions.\nThat means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life, including women, children, and the followers of all faiths. Numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens Arab and Muslim communities.\nFor many centuries, the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims, and Jews living side by side. We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once again and make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope.\nIn that spirit, after concluding my visit in a fabulous place that we're at today, Riyadh—which I've gotten to know so well in so short a time—I will travel to Jerusalem and Bethlehem and then to the Vatican, visiting many of the holiest places in the three Abrahamic faiths. If these three faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible, including peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Abbas.\nStarving terrorists of their territory, of their funding, and the false allure of the craven ideology will be the basis for easily defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the Government that gives terrorists all three: safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in that region. I am speaking, of course, of Iran.\nFrom Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a Government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room. Among Iran's most tragic and destabilizing interventions, you've seen it in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Asad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Asad regime, launching 59 missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region and as quickly as possible.\nThe Iranian regime's longest suffering victims are its own people. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders' reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism—cannot do it—and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they so richly deserve. The decisions we make will affect countless lives.\nKing Salman, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history and for your massive investments in America and its industries and its jobs. I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world. The fertile region—and it is so fertile—has all of the ingredients for extraordinary success: a rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise. But you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror, and violence.\nWe in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers and for action. And when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice and yearns for peace.\nToday, billions of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time. Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on Earth? If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bring: more suffering, more death, and more despair.\nBut if we act, if we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the world, then there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have. The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what tomorrow could bring: glorious wonders of science, art, medicine, and commerce to inspire mankind; great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns; new jobs and industries that will lift up millions and millions of people; parents who no longer worry for their children, their families and who no longer mourn for their loved ones; and the faithful who finally worship without fear.\nThese are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every single human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved people.\nI ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to fight together—because united, we will not fail. We cannot fail. Nobody, absolutely nobody, can beat us.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless your countries. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-05-21", "title": "Remarks at the Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125541", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:35 P.M. EDT\nMR. CZWARTACKI: Good afternoon, everyone. We are here to announce -- proudly announce -- the fiscal year 2018 presidential budget. I just want to remind you that this is an on-the-record briefing, but it is embargoed until 9:00 p.m. tonight. That includes all audio. And folks on the phone, it includes you guys, too.\nSo without any further ado, let me introduce Director Mulvaney.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Hello, hello. Thank you all for coming out today to talk about the budget. Before I start, I want to thank -- I don't usually come with such a large crowd, but this is like 1/100 of the budget team. There's about 500 people across the street who worked on this, so I wanted to have them come and see this live, see what it's like, and maybe even help me answer some questions later on.\nBut here's where we are. The budget comes out tomorrow. We're delivering it to the Hill tomorrow. This is it. We'll be taking this to both the budget folks on the House and the Senate side tomorrow during the day. I'll be testifying on Wednesday in front of the House Budget Committee and Thursday in front of the Senate Budget Committee.\nThe title on the front is: A New Foundation for American Greatness. That's the title that we came up with. And as I was reading through it this weekend, I was trying to figure out, okay, what's new and what's a foundation? And what's American greatness?\nSo I want to break it down and talk about it like that for a few minutes before I take your question.\nWhat's new? I said if I had sort of a subtitle for this budget, it would be the Taxpayer First Budget. This is I think the first time in a long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the taxes. So often in Washington I think we look only on the recipient side: How does the budget affect those who either receive or don't receive benefits?\nAnd it's been a long time. I can't remember the last time we actually looked through -- looked at a budget through the perspective of the people who are paying it. The question we asked ourselves, as we were going line by line -- and believe me this team here when line by line with me through this budget: Can I ask somebody, a family in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to pay tax money to the government so that I can do X?\nAnd if the answer to X is to help a vet who has lost both limbs in an explosion in the Middle East, the answer is, yeah, I can do that without any reservation. And my guess is they'd be happy to pay it.\nIf the answer to X is some program that only helps one out of every 15 people it's designed to help, and it hasn't had any type of really good research on it in 10 years, and oh, by the way, it's not authorized by Congress, that's a different result.\nAnd that's what I mean when I say it's a taxpayer-first budget, going line by line through the budget, trying to put yourself in the shoes of the people who are paying for those lines.\nWhat else is new about it? It balances in 10 years. It balances in the 10th year. In fact, it begins to reduce the deficit as a percentage of the overall economy in year one. We can talk a little bit about the details on that, if you'd like, during the Q&A.\nThe foundation -- what's the foundation? What is this all about? What's the heart of this? I'm trying to figure out a way to articulate this the best. There was an article a couple weeks back about \"What is Trumponomics?\" And I think what Trumponomics is and what this budget is a part of is an effort to get to sustained 3 percent economic growth in this country again.\nI think it's sad that the previous administration was willing to admit that we couldn't get better than 1.9 percent growth over the next 10 years. I think it's sad that the CBO does the same thing. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that we'll never grow at more than 1.9 percent again, out into infinity.\nThat assumes a pessimism about America, about the economy, about its people, about its culture that we're simply refusing to accept. We believe that we can get to 3 percent growth.\nAnd by the way, we do not believe that that is something fanciful. In fact, there was a very well-written piece, by the way -- I don't know if The Washington Post is here or not today -- a very well-written piece I thought in the Post this morning. But one of its lines was that: \"The budget relies on an unprecedented level of economic growth.\" An unprecedented level of economic growth? No, it's not. It's 3 percent, which is below the average since the founding of the country. It's below the average since World War Two. The average is slightly above 3 percent. That is what an ordinary, healthy American economy is supposed to look like -- not 1.9 percent growth forever.\nIf you are a 30-year-old adult, you have never had a job in a healthy American economy. You've either been in a recession or sluggish recovery. And you think this is normal. And we are here to tell you it is not.\nI grew up. I was a young man during the '90s when we had healthy economic growth in this country, and if I got fired, I could find another job -- because that's what you can do with 3 percent economic growth. When I didn't like my job -- and I didn't -- I quit, so I could go start my own company. That's what you can do with 3 percent economic growth. That's a dynamism that used to be normal in the American economy. And that's what we're trying to get back to, and that's what this budget is part and parcel of. It drives our tax reform policy, our regulatory policy, trade, energy, welfare, infrastructure, and our government's spending priorities. Everything is keyed to getting us back to 3 percent.\nThe ugly truth is this: You can never balance the budget at 1.9 percent growth. Just not going to happen. So those out there who say you're never going to grow beyond 1.9 percent are condemning us to a future filled with nothing but debts and deficits.\nHow do we get there? Amongst other things, we'll talk about that. We talk about this in terms of tax policy. We talk about capital investment. Right now, one of the things that touches on the budget and how we get 3 percent growth, we need folks to work. We do. We need people to go to work. If you're on food stamps, and you're able-bodied, we need you to go to work. If you're on disability insurance and you're not supposed to be -- if you're not truly disabled, we need you to go back to work. We need everybody pulling in the same direction.\nI think the difference right now between the U3 and the U6 unemployment rate -- I'll look at this, don't want to get this wrong -- remember U3 is the unemployment rate as we look at it; and then U6 is the unemployed, plus the marginally attached, plus part-time for economic reasons, right? So it's folks who want to work more but can't. That's the difference between U3 and U6 -- U3 unemployed, U6 unemployed plus folks who aren't working enough but want to. That's 6.8 million people. Okay? We want those folks to work. We need them to work. They want to work as evidenced by the fact they're part-time against their will.\nThis is one of the things the budget focuses on. We go through the various reforms that we talk about. There's a dignity to work, and there's a necessity to work to help the country succeed. And we need everybody to pull in the same direction.\nAt the same time, the budget -- while it does balance in 10 years, it also funds the President's priorities. I was here with most of you in March. We talked about some of the increases in spending to suit the President's -- to meet the President's campaign promises. It will be familiar to you by now: more money for national security, more money for border security -- and that means bricks and mortar for a wall, technology people, infrastructure at the border. It also means more money for law enforcement at the federal and the state levels. It means more money for veterans, more money for school choice. What we didn't talk about in March but it's part of this budget is a -- for the first time ever, by any administration of any party, we are proposing a nationwide paid parental leave -- $25 billion for that over the course of the 10-year budgets -- a truly groundbreaking thing for this President to do, and to prove to folks that we can do things like that, okay, and we can still balance the budget if we prioritize our spending right.\nBy the way, people ask, you say, Mulvaney, you're used to be a Freedom Caucus guy, how can you support paid parental leave? It goes right to the heart of the matter on 3 percent growth. We need men and women who are sitting home thinking you know what, I don't know if I can go back to work because we're getting ready to have a kid. And what happens if I have to stay home? We try and create the environment where people are more comfortable going back to work and staying at work knowing that if they do have a child, they'll be able to spend time with that child under the paid parental leave program.\nWe can do all of that and balance -- because there's a certain philosophy wrapped up in the budget, and that is that we are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs. We're going to measure compassion and success by the number of people we help get off of those programs and get back in charge of their own lives. We're not going to measure our success by how much money we spend, but by how many people we actually help.\nAlong those lines, by the way, we take a really, really hard look at unauthorized programs. We've not finished counting yet, but I think the last time anybody counted, it was close to $300 billion -- $300 billion of money that we spend every single year on unauthorized programs. What does that mean? It means that Congress has not seen fit to extend programs that by their natural terms are supposed to expire.\nSo if they're not important enough for Congress to take up, are they really important for me to spend your money on? And I think that's a valid conversation and drives a large part of what we're trying to do in the budget.\nI want to give two examples of these things. We talk about waste, fraud, and abuse. We talk about authorized programs. We talk about how to prioritize spending and how to look at programs that work and don't work. The childcare tax credit and the earned income tax credit. One of our proposals is that we are going to require you to have a Social Security number now to collect those. Why is that? Because I can ask you for your money, I think, in good faith and good conscience and say, look, I need to take some of your tax money and give it to this family who deserves the childcare tax credit. But I can't do it to give the earned income tax credit, which is designed to help folks who work, to give it to somebody who is in the country and working illegally. That's just not fair. It's not right when you look at it through the perspective of the people who pay the taxes. And it's one of our proposals.\nThe other one that I talk about -- I'll pull out some notes on this -- is that the TRIO Program. It's an education program - - and I can never remember what TRIO stands for -- T-R-I-O. It's actually got five parts to it, as only a federal program can. It's a TRIO Program with five parts. There's three parts that actually work, and they are the Upward Bound, the Talent Search, and the Students Support Services Programs part of TRIO. What do we say when it works? It means that when Department of Ed, either internally or paid somebody externally to come and look at those programs, they accomplish their goal. They helped people who would not have gone to college or not have stayed in college to graduate, okay? That's what those programs are designed for, and that's what I'm comfortable going and asking you for help with by giving us some of your taxpayer money.\nThe other two programs -- the McNair grad school program and the Educational Opportunity Centers -- don't. In fact, the McNair program is the McNair post-baccalaureate something, something. It's designed to take folks from -- after they graduate from college to get a post-bachelor's degree. The last time the Department of Education looked at this, it was 6 percent effective -- 6 percent. I can't do that anymore. We can't do that anymore. We cannot defend programs like that -- 6 percent just doesn't cut it. The 21st Century Community Learning Center Program says that less than 20 percent of the kids enrolled improved because of the program -- 20 percent doesn't cut it anymore. Okay? We're $20 trillion in debt. Every single one of you in here owes the federal government roughly $60,000. Each of my 17-year-old triplets owes the federal government $60,000. Every man, woman, and child in the country is $60,000 in debt because of the $20 trillion debt we've run up. We cannot continue to simply measure our compassion or our success by the amount of money we spend. We're going to measure our passion and our success by actually helping people and by respecting the taxpayers who paid for it in the first place.\nAnd that is the last piece of the puzzle. That is the American greatness part of it.\nSo with that, I apologize for talking so long. You know I don't usually do that. Mostly I was practicing for tomorrow. But I guess you're going first with questions? Is that what -- raise your hand.\nQ: So Congress says that -- or at least there are people on the Hill who say the Medicaid cuts that are proposed in this budget are not sustainable. I'd like to get your reaction to that.\nAnd number two, what about the critics who say that this budget is incredibly hard-hearted for those -- the least of our\nbrothers, those who have the least amount of income?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, let's deal with Medicaid first. We assume the Affordable Health Care Act that passed out of the House passes. That has some Medicaid changes into it. We wrap that into our budget proposals. We go another half a step further and ratchet down some of the growth rates that are assumed in the AHCA. So if you assume growth rates -- I can't remember what the exact measure is -- it's a CPI-plus measure. We take a measure that we think is closer to what the actual growth rates look like.\nBut to your larger part about hard-hearted, for the school teacher in Kenosha, Wisconsin, who is trying to raise two kids by herself, save for their college and save for their retirement, isn't it hard-hearted to go to her and say give me money for a program that's only 6 percent effective?\nQ: You're still asking her for the same amount of money, you're just diverting it somewhere else.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: We are. Absolutely. But I think it is hard-hearted to look at her and say, I want to take your money so that this 6-percent-effective program can continue to fund at the same time instead of what we're doing now and saying, can we have your 6 percent to help defend the nation? Can we have your 6 percent to help the veterans? Can we have your 6 percent to help law enforcement? And I think the answer to that question is yes.\nPeople don't mind paying their taxes -- people don't mind paying their taxes as long as they know their money is not being wasted. And for too long I think the federal government has been unwilling to prove to them that that's the case.\nYes, sir, in the back.\nQ: This budget doesn't address entitlement programs.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks for that. I appreciate that.\nQ: And so how does 3 percent growth deal with the more than 3 percent growth in those two main programs?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: And I forgot to mention -- do not touch mainline Social Security, and we do not touch Medicare in this program.\nAnd I could tell you exactly how it went down. In fact, I think I've talked about in a limited fashion. I went into the President with a list of proposed entitlement reforms -- some reductions, some eliminations -- and gave him a list. I don't know -- the list was probably a page long. And we went down the list. Yes, yes, no, no, yes, no, yes, no, no. Okay?\nQ: What were the yeses?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: And the no's -- well, we'll do the -- and we'll talk about that in a second.\nThe no's were all Social Security and Medicare. That's it. He said, I promised people on the campaign trail I would not touch their retirement, and I would not touch Medicaid.\nAnd we don't do it. I honestly was surprised that we could balance the budget without changing those programs, but we manage to do that. We'll talk about how we did that in a second.\nAt the same time, before I get the question -- people are going to say, oh, but Social Security disability insurance is part of Social Security. If you ask 999 people out of 1,000 would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security. It's old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social Security. In fact, the paid parental leave program that we are running, we are running it through the unemployment insurance program. And I think a couple of states right now actually that do it at the state level run it through their disability program. That does not mean that paid parental leave is unemployment or disability any more than the Social Security disability insurance program is part of Social Security. It just happens to be where they are structured.\nQ: But how do you stand behind a budget that doesn't deal with those two issues? I understand the President doesn't want to. But you voted for programs that -- in that past that --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I absolutely did. And I made the case for why those programs needed to be reformed. The President said, no, I'm going to keep my promises.\nAnd I said, well, I'd still like to balance the budget.\nHe goes, I still want you to balance the budget, just don't do it changing these programs.\nAnd we were able to do it. You asked the question about, how does 3 percent economic growth contribute to that? It actually does help the program, as you can probably imagine, as more people go into work -- and the President talked about this a little bit I think on the campaign trail -- as people come -- that U3-U6 split, which again is like 6 million people, if those folks go back to work full-time, they're now paying into the system. If the folks who are on Social Security disability insurance who are not supposed to be, if they go back to work, they're paying into the system, and they're not taking out of the system. So it does make the programs healthier. It does not solve their long-term deficiencies.\nQ: The spending is a higher rate than 3 percent, combined?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I think that's fair, but again, the programs get healthier with 3 percent than they do at 1.9 percent. And, yes, we do not change them in this budget.\nYes, sir.\nQ: What about the President's promise not to touch Medicaid?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I think we assumed that in the Affordable Health Care Act, and the President has made it very clear that he supports what the House is doing because it's better than the alternative. And the alternative right now is Obamacare. We can have a long conversation about the drawbacks with Obamacare, the shortcomings, the fact that -- didn't Iowa just lose a bunch of its coverage in a bunch of its counties? So we can go over that again.\nI think once the President said I support the American Health Care Act, part of that was Medicaid reform.\nYes.\nQ: Briefly about the border wall funding. It went from $4.1 billion to $1.6 billion. What conversations did you have with the President? Where are things going to have to sort of come to the table? And where were cuts made?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'm not sure where the $4.1 billion number is. The spending on the border security is $2.6 billion, of which I think $1.6 billion is actual bricks and mortar construction. The other $1 billion is infrastructure and technology. I'm not sure where the $4.1 billion number comes from.\nQ: From the blueprint to what you're looking at now, tomorrow what you're going to present to Congress, what changes do you have to make?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Oh, oh, oh. Yes, the number in the blueprint was DHS writ large, okay? So that DHS includes border security and other stuff, okay? So when I say $2.6 billion for the border, I think the equivalent in the 2017 request was $1.6 billion. I'm looking at Russ. I think that's the right answer. So apples to apples, it's a larger request in 2018, which you would expect because the 2017 request as part of that omnibus discussion was only for five months out of the year.\nThe woman behind you had a question. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Hi. About half of all U.S. births are covered by Medicaid now. Is there any provision in here for pregnant women or preventative care?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: There are a bunch. If you could ask us that again after the meeting, that would be great -- because I don't have the list with me of all the Medicaid programs. But we do expand a bunch of women's health programs. And the Medicaid proposals that we make -- mostly changing the growth rates and so forth -- don't touch on precisely what you've mentioned. So I don't want to give you an answer that's not accurate. But the short answer is I don't know the answer.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you walk us though the list of cuts that are proposed for mandatory programs, for entitlements like SNAP and other?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can. There's a notebook full of them, and I think you're going to get --\nQ: Well, can you just give some highlights?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can. At the end you all are going to get the tables? Is that what it is? Here you want to -- actually, I'll just run through it. I tell you what, why don't you pick an agency. Let's do --\nQ: Let's do SNAP.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: SNAP, oh, sure, okay. Let's talk about SNAP. The programs at SNAP. One of the things we've seen with SNAP, formerly food stamps. I still refer to them as food stamps. I know that's not technically correct -- is that as you might expect, they spiked during the recession. But they've not come down like we would expect them to do. In fact, they've stayed up at very, very elevated levels. I think at the height of the recession there were 47 million people on SNAP, and now there's 44 million -- even though we're at supposedly near full employment, notwithstanding that differential between U3 and U6. So I think that raises a very valid question, which is that: Are there folks on SNAP who shouldn't be?\nAnd so our primary -- we do two primary things. We do have an able-bodied work requirement. If you don't have any dependent children, and you're an able-bodied adult, we start to phase in that requirement.\nWe also look to -- and we're doing this in a couple of programs -- we look to the states to help us. And what we do is to ask them to start to participate in a cost-sharing program.\nWith SNAP, I believe that the states already participate 50 percent in the administrative costs. But 100 percent of the costs of the actual providing the programs -- providing the benefits fall to the federal government.\nAnd what we've done is slowly try to phase in a state match for this reason, which is that they're the folks who are administering the program, and they probably do a better job than we do on recognizing where the programs can be improved.\nAs a former state legislator, I can assure you that's the case. When I was in South Carolina, we knew where the difficulties were in some of our federal programs, but we didn't have the flexibility to fix it. Plus on food stamps, we didn't have the motivation to fix it. We didn't have the incentive to fix it because the Feds were picking up all the whole tab. So what we do is go to the states and say, look, we want you to have a little bit of skin the game and help us -- because you know how to make the programs better -- to improve the programs and save money.\nAnd those are the two major drivers in SNAP. Again, the goal is this, and this is the goal with all of our safety net -- we believe in the social safety net. We absolutely do. I know folks want to say that -- the narrative is that Republicans don't. I believe in the social safety net. I also think that it helps us get to that 3 percent growth because having that social safety net does provide people with the confidence of knowing they can take a gamble and fail, and they won't be completely wiped out, okay? So I believe in the social safety net. And what we've done is not to try and remove the safety net for folks who need it, but to try and figure out if there's folks who don't need that need to be back in the workforce.\nQ: So would that come through the farm bill? Would you have to wait till the farm bill to make a change like that? Or do you foresee some other strategy?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, I think it's part of -- because SNAP is part of the farm bill.\nQ: Do you also see crop subsidies?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I see that as separately.\nGo ahead.\nQ: Thank you, two questions. One for the foreign aid budget, there have been reports that with regards to foreign aid, military aid, much of that is going to be replaced by offers of loans -- countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia, Pakistan, Philippines, and Ukraine. Can you confirm that? That's the first question.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, this is embargoed. Yes, I can confirm that. Yes, we do change a couple of the foreign military programs from direct grants to loans. Our argument was instead of loaning somebody -- giving somebody $100 million, we can give them a smaller number worth of loan guarantees and they can actually buy more stuff. We did not change it for Israel. We did not change it for Egypt.\nAIDE: I think a lot of the specifics the State Department is still working on.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Got you. But we do change -- we do propose to change some of those programs.\nQ: And the second question. With regard to the earned income tax credit, you mentioned requiring a Social Security number for receiving that. Do you mean a Social Security number for parents, or for children -- particular children who are born American citizens?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I think it's the parents.\nQ: So the earned income tax credit is meant to help parents raise families -- the idea is you have a child -- and if you look at the tax credit, if you don't happen to have children --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: You're not supposed to get the tax credit if you don't have children.\nQ: Right. And so how does that help people, whether they're here legally or not, raise families if those families have American citizen children?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thank you. That's the exact difference we're talking about in the perspective on this budget. You're sitting there focusing only on one side of the equation, okay? And we're trying to focus on both -- both recipients of the aid and the folks who pay for the aid. How do I go to somebody who pays their taxes and say, look, I want you to give this earned income tax credit to somebody who is working here illegally? That's not defensible. And it's a reasonable accommodation to simply ask them for Social Security numbers.\nQ: But it's supposed to help the kids, is what I'm saying.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's supposed to help the families. Okay? There are other programs all up and down our federal government, all up and down the budget that help the children. We help them at school and we help them after school, we help them in preschool. I mean, Title I --\nQ: But that's --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Give me a second. Now, hold on a second. Title I is $15 billion, I think, in terms of programs to help kids like that. So I hear what you're saying. The point of the matter is it's not unreasonable to ask for a Social Security number before they get those benefits.\nQ: Can you explain, where does the tax for locations come in in this budget with respect to the API -- American Pacific Islanders?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'm sorry, I do not know the answer to that question. But if you can reach out to my office afterwards -- I tried really hard to get every line item in the budget memorized. It's just not going to happen.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: So what are the three major areas of savings?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The repeal of Obamacare I think is the number one item. I want to say that's $800 by itself?\nAIDE: Yeah, it's $800 billion.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: -- $800 billion by itself for repeal of Obamacare.\nAIDE: With the additional Medicaid reforms --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: On top of that. So I think that's the big one. After that, we've got some --\nAIDE: Food stamps --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: SNAP programs, student loans -- and what was the other?\nAIDE: Federal retirees.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Federal retirees. And all of this will be in the tables that you folks get at the end of the day.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Director. Real quick question -- I have two questions for you. The real quick one is, is there aid in your budget for Pakistan?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, but we changed the program in Pakistan from a -- we don't? Yes, we do maintain aid to Pakistan in the budget. I believe -- I don't believe it's at the same levels as previous.\nSorry, do you have a follow-up?\nQ: That's a loan, or you changed the process for them?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Rob is our national defense specialist, and he was telling me that State still has some flexibility to come up with a final plan on that. But I do know that, writ large, we have moved several -- we have proposed to move several countries from a direct grant program to a loan guarantee program.\nCLARIFICATION:\n\"Director Mulvaney stated that FMF funding for Pakistan would be provided in the form of a loan guarantee. This is one of the options that the Administration had explored in its internal deliberations, but the request itself does not make that determination. Whether the funding is provided through grants, or as a subsidy for a guaranteed loan, is an option the State Department can exercise to ensure our foreign assistance best supports our national interests.\"\nQ: And I have another one on this. You've been a congressman before, you've seen these budget proposals, budget blueprints being sent over from the White House to Congress. You know as a congressman, when key proposals, budget blueprints are sent over, they look at them -- congressmen who lead committees\n-- congresswomen who lead committees -- and they go, thank you, we're going to start anew. What makes you think that this Congress isn't going to do the same thing with the budget proposal that you're sending them?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's a fair point, and I think legislatures everywhere sort of look at the executive budget like that. But they look at it -- this is how we offer, this is what the law intends, okay? We're required by the Budget Act of 1974 to do this. Why? Why do we do it? And why do we spend so much time on it? Why do we actually get down in the details like this? Keep in mind, the 2019 budget -- this is the '18 -- the 2019 budget, work on that will begin in September, right, of '17. That's how far off we work.\nSo we take this very seriously. Why? There's a certain message here, okay, and it's the message from the President of the United States to the Congress that says, look, here are my priorities in terms of where I want to spend more; here's where I think we shouldn't be spending nearly as much; and here's some of the big-ticket items. And one of the big-ticket items is I want more money for defense; I want more money for border security; I want more money for the vets and school choice; and I don't want to add to the deficit this year; and I want to be responsible for the taxpayers in a way that we haven't been before.\nIf Congress has a different way to get to that endpoint, God bless them. That's great. And that will be part of my testimony to both the House and the Senate this week. Do I expect them to adopt this 100 percent, wholeheartedly, without any change? Absolutely not. Do I expect them to work with the administration on trying to figure out places where we're on the same page? Absolutely. But I don't think it invalidates the importance, the credibility of the President's budget just because they're not going to pass it wholeheartedly.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: You may have covered this already, but does it defund Planned Parenthood? And number two, does it defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, and yes. It does the first one because it assumes the American Health Care Act passes and the AHCA in its current form, which is the one we assumed -- and that's making a bunch of assumptions, here -- that it assumes that passes and that defunds Planned Parenthood.\nThe elimination of -- actually, it's not eliminated, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. There's a little money left in the budget to allow us to wind down the federal position. I think we account for 15 percent of their funding right now. So we don't take it to zero right away, but we do anticipate to.\nI have time for one or two more. Yes, sir.\nQ: I guess I'm wondering if, in the table that you're going to give us, if it includes both the economic assumptions beyond --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I think I give you the economic assumptions, we're going to give you the inflation assumptions, give you the unemployment rates -- all the basic macroeconomic --\nQ: And then is the President's tax plan incorporated into this budget?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's a good question. Yes and no. The tax plan, as you know, is in its very early stages. We released our one-page summary that's sort of to drive -- start to drive the debate, I don't know, probably three or four weeks ago now. We do assume in this budget that that plan is deficit-neutral, just because it was, in all honesty, the most efficient way to look at it, because if we said it's going to add to the deficit, then we have to go into more detail than what's in the summary right now. If we say it's going to reduce the deficit, we have to go into more detail than what's in it right now. And we simply are not in a position to do that.\nWe released our principles. We've sent them to the Hill. Discussions are ongoing. In fact, I think Mike Pence is going to be talking with members of the --\nQ: -- not going to see like what those income tax plans actually correspond to or --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, you won't see any more detail on this than you already have.\nLast one. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you talk about the cap in discretionary spending? We know the $54 billion next year. What's that number at the end of the 10 years, and do you have a total for the 10 years?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's in the tables. I don't remember off the top of my head, but I do know the concept that we put in place. And the concept we put in place is a general, what we call the two-penny plan, which is that every single year we see those reduced by two cents on the dollar, every single year. So you do see this sort of reduction in the nondefense discretionary in order to hit the Budget Control Act caps and to accommodate the President's other priorities.\nAll right, look, let's do this. I'll leave you the summary tables. I know you have a lot more questions. I'm coming back tomorrow to do this on TV, and I'm doing the committee hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, so there will be plenty of chance to talk about this during the week.\nThank you all very much for your accommodation. And we'll pass this stuff out now.\nEND 2:06 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-22", "title": "Off-camera Briefing of the FY18 Budget by Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney"}

President Trump, Donald, Sara and I are absolutely delighted to welcome you and Melania to the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people, the united capital of the Jewish state.\nWe've known each other for many years, and it's always good to see you. But it's also wonderful to see the blossoming friendship between our two beautiful wives, Sara and Melania. You're so welcome here, and we're so pleased to see you. We're honored to have you in our home.\nYou've been today, Mr. President, to the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites of Judaism. You have been to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the holiest sites of Christianity. We protect the Christian sites as no one else does anywhere in this region. We protect Christian sites, Muslim sites, obviously Jewish sites. We're committed to the freedom of all faiths and to the rights of all.\nMr. President, I appreciate the fact that you went to the Western Wall and you're the first acting President who's done that. The people of Israel applaud you for it. [Applause]\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. We had a terrific discussion today. And when I say terrific, it encompasses everything. We can talk about deregulation; we can talk about economics. I think we quote each other. We understand each other and so much of the things that we wish to accomplish for both our countries.\nBut I want to thank you especially today for your deep commitment to Israel's security, its well-being, and its future. I have no doubt that, as we work together, you and I, the alliance between our countries will grow ever stronger. I want you to know how much we appreciate the change in American policy on Iran, which you enunciated so clearly just an hour ago.\nI want you to know how much we appreciate your bold decision to act against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. And I want to tell you also how much we appreciate the reassertion of American leadership in the Middle East.\nI look forward to working closely with you to confront the dangers we face together in this violent and volatile Middle East. I believe that together we can roll back Iran's march of aggression and terror in this region, and we can thwart Iran's unbridled ambition to become a nuclear weapons state.\nI also look forward to working closely with you to advance peace in our region, because you have noted so succinctly that common dangers are turning former enemies into partners. And that's where we see something new and potentially something very promising. It won't be simple. But for the first time in many years—and, Mr. President, for the first time in my lifetime—I see a real hope for change.\nThe Arab leaders who you met yesterday could help change the atmosphere, and they could help create the conditions for a realistic peace. These are all great signs on your historic visits. It's a visit that I think has echoed down the ages, because the great Abraham Lincoln is reported to have said that there was no city on Earth he so much desired to see as Jerusalem.\nWell, Mr. President, Donald, there's no city on Earth where you are more welcome than right here with us in Jerusalem. Welcome to Jerusalem. Welcome to Israel.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. And it's a great honor to be with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and of course, Sara. Thank you.

Thank you very much.\nYou honored me and Melania by being one of the first world leaders to visit the White House, as you know. And we had a very good and sound discussion. And now you honor us again by welcoming us to your home on my first trip abroad as the President of the United States.\nThis is a land filled with beauty, wonder, and the spirit of God. I've been amazed by the glorious and beautiful monuments and holy sites and the generosity of your incredible people.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Because it's all about the people.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. That's right.\nPresident Trump. I was deeply moved by my visit today to the Western Wall. Words fail to capture the experience. It will leave an impression on me forever.\nToday we reaffirmed the unbreakable bond of friendship between Israel and the United States, a friendship built on our shared love of freedom, our shared belief in human dignity, and our shared hope for an Israel at lasting peace. We want Israel to have peace.\nBut we are more than friends. We are great allies. We have so many opportunities in front of us. But we must seize them together. We must take advantage of the situation, and there are many, many things that can happen now that would never have been able to happen before. And we understand that very well. That includes advancing prosperity, defeating the evils of terrorism, and facing the threat of an Iranian regime that is threatening the region and causing so much violence and suffering.\nDuring my travels, I have seen many hopeful signs that lead me to believe that we can truly achieve a more peaceful future for this region and for people of all faiths and all beliefs and, frankly, all over the world.\nIn my visit to Saudi Arabia, I met with many leaders of the Arab and Muslim world, including King Salman, who treated us so beautifully and really wants to see great things happen for the world. He really does. I got to know him well, and he really does.\nThese leaders voiced concerns we all share: about ISIS, about Iran's rising ambitions and rolling back its gains, and about the menace of extremism that has spread through too many parts of the Muslim world. I'm encouraged that they pledged cooperation to confront terrorism and the hateful ideology that drives it so hard. America welcomes the action and support of any nation willing to do the hard but vital work in eradicating the violent ideologies that have caused so much needless bloodshed and killing here and all over the world.\nWe are willing to work together. I believe that a new level of partnership is possible and will happen, one that will bring greater safety to this region, greater security to the United States, and greater prosperity to the world. This includes a renewed effort at peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and I thank the Prime Minister for his commitment to pursuing the peace process. He's working very hard at it. It's not easy. I've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all, but I have a feeling that we're going to get there eventually, I hope.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. I'm certain we will have very productive discussions. And we're going to have very productive discussions, in my opinion, with the leaders of other nations also. And I feel strongly about that, because there's a lot of love out there. And people from all nations, even nations that you would be surprised to hear, they want to stop the killing. They've had enough.\nAmerica stands ready to assist in every way we can. Our deep and lasting friendship will only grow deeper and stronger as we work together in the days ahead. I thank you again for hosting us in this beautiful and ancient land. Truly, it's a land of wonders. And it's my honor to be here with you.\nSara, thank you. Bibi, thank you.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. I appreciate it very much. Great honor. Thank you.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu.

President Rivlin and his wife Nechama, President Trump, Madam First Lady, Donald, Melania: Welcome—a very warm welcome to Israel.\nYour visit here, Mr. President, is truly historic. Never before has the first foreign trip of a President of the United States included a visit to Israel. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for this powerful expression of your friendship to Israel.\nMr. President, yesterday in Saudi Arabia, you delivered a forceful speech of clarity and conviction. You called on all nations to drive out terrorists and extremists. You called for the forces of civilization to confront the forces of barbarism. Mr. President, for 69 years, Israel has been doing precisely that. We've manned the front lines of civilizations, we've fought terrorism, and we've built a moderate, vibrant, democratic, Jewish state.\nIn doing so, Mr. President, we've protected all faiths: Muslims, Christians—everyone. Throughout the Middle East, Christian communities are decimated, minorities persecuted. But here in Israel, we are proud to have a growing and thriving Christian community, and we guarantee the rights of all.\nMr. President, Israel also shares the commitment to peace that you expressed yesterday. We've already made peace with Egypt and with Jordan. And Israel's hand is extended to peace—in peace to all our neighbors, including the Palestinians. The peace we seek is a genuine and durable one in which the Jewish state is recognized, security remains in Israel's hands, and the conflict ends once and for all.\nMr. President, you just flew from Riyadh to Tel Aviv. I hope that one day an Israeli Prime Minister will be able to fly from Tel Aviv to Riyadh. May your first trip to our region prove to be a historic milestone on the path towards reconciliation and peace. I look forward to working with you in the years ahead, Mr. President, to advance security, prosperity, and peace. I'm confident that, under your leadership, the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States will become ever greater, ever stronger.\nDonald and Melania, the entire U.S. delegation, on behalf of the Government and the people of Israel, we welcome you to the State of Israel. May God bless you, Mr. President, may God bless Israel, and may God bless the United States of America.\n[The master of ceremonies spoke briefly in Hebrew and then continued in English as follows.]\nMaster of Ceremonies. Ladies and gentleman, the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America. President Trump. Thank you, and shalom. It is wonderful to be here in Israel. President Rivlin, Mrs. Rivlin, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Mrs. Netanyahu: Thank you very much.\nI am deeply grateful for your invitation and very, very honored to be with you. On my first trip overseas as President, I have come to this sacred and ancient land to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between the United States and the State of Israel.\nIn this land so rich in history, Israel has built one of the world's great civilizations: a strong, resilient, determined, and prosperous nation. It is also a nation forged in the commitment that we will never allow the horrors and atrocities of the last century to be repeated. Now we must work together to build a future where the nations of the region are at peace and all of our children can grow and grow up strong and grow up free from terrorism and violence.\nDuring my travels in recent days, I have found new reasons for hope. I have just concluded a visit to Saudi Arabia, where yesterday I met with King Salman and with the leaders from across the Muslim and Arab world. In that visit, we reached historic agreements to pursue greater and greater cooperation in the fight against terrorism and its evil ideology. My future travels will take me to visit Pope Francis at the Vatican and then our NATO and European allies.\nWe have before us a rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace to this region and to its people, defeating terrorism, and creating a future of harmony, prosperity, and peace. But we can only get there working together. There is no other way.\nMr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with both of you during my stay. We love Israel, we respect Israel, and I send your people the warmest greetings from your friend and ally: all of the people in the United States of America. We are with you.\nThank you, and God bless you.

And you would love to see that, wouldn't you? Huh? And David Friedman, likewise, one of the most successful lawyers in the United States. And he said, I want to do something. He's your Ambassador, as you know, David Friedman.\nSo we're very honored to have the two of you working so hard to try and bring about peace. And I think you'll be very successful. And if you're not, you'll get blamed, because I just put it on record that you're going to do a good job. [Laughter]\nSo that's all right, but my staff has been fantastic. And as you know, Rex, our Secretary of State, has done an incredible job. We just got back from the Middle East. We just got back from Saudi Arabia. And we were treated incredibly well. And there's tremendous—well, really good—feeling toward Israel. And I will say, one of the things, I think—we can call it an outreach—but what's happened with Iran has brought many other parts of the Middle East toward Israel. And you could say that's one of the—if there's a benefit, that would be the benefit, because I've seen such a different feeling toward Israel from countries that, as you know, were not feeling so well about Israel not so long ago. And it's brought a lot of folks together, and I think you've seen it, and you've even mentioned it many—on many occasions. So that is a real positive, and we're very happy about that.\nPresident Rivlin. Every challenge creates opportunities.\nPresident Trump. It's a challenge, and it's an opportunity.\nPresident Rivlin. And I'll——\nPresident Trump. But you have a great opportunity right now. There's a great feeling for peace throughout the Middle East. I think people have just had enough. They've had enough of the bloodshed and the killing. And I think you're going to see things starting to happen.\nWhat we did over the weekend was—they say there's never been anything like it ever before. And it was really a coming together. And now, today, being in Israel is just very, very special for us. So we expect to have some very interesting talks.\nPresident Rivlin. Absolutely. We are praying for peace, and we are pushing for peace for the last 100 years. And with God's help, somebody will bring us peace, all together—all together. Thank you.\nPresident Trump.

And I have to express our appreciation not only for that, but also for your friendship for the State of Israel, your understanding of our story, our struggles, our desire for peace. Which is—all of these things I want to talk to you about, including, including——\n[At this point, a reporter in the audience could be heard speaking over President Netanyahu.]\nJournalists can do that. They can take over.\nPresident Trump. I know.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Including Iran, including Syria, including the Palestinians, including the wonderful cooperation between our two countries, and anything else that you care to think about.\nPresident Trump. Well, it's just been an honor to be here. The Western Wall was just incredible being there—spent time. And your folks have been so nice. As you know, I've been a big supporter of Israel for a long time. I've been a big supporter of yours for a long time. But it's just a magnificent place, with magnificent people. Many, many friends come from Israel. My great friends come from Israel. And I'm very honored to be here.\nI was just told I'm the first active President been to the Western Wall, and that's a great honor. I was just told that. That, to me, is a great honor. And thank you very much. And I know we're going to have a meeting in a little while, which is momentarily, and ideally, we're going to work on a couple of things.\nI just left—I will say, I just left Saudi Arabia, the King—we had an amazing 2 days. And their feeling toward Israel is really very positive. Tremendous progress has been made. I think a lot of that progress has been made because of the aggression of Iran. And it's forcing people together in a very positive way. And if you look at King Salman and Saudi Arabia, and others that I was with—UAE and Bahrain and Kuwait and so many others, it was something. It was very historic what took place over the last 2 days. But I could see a much deeper path to friendship with Israel, and I think a lot of that's spurred on—whatever it takes—but a lot of it's spurred on by what's happening with Iran. So progress has been made.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. I think that the fact that you've taken a very strong position on Iran—different position—not only helps security, but also helps propel the possibilities of reconciliation and peace between Israel and the Arab world. And that will help reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians. Of course, not all of that I like to discuss before the cameras, but I do look forward to our discussions, which I think are pregnant with possibilities. President Trump. But you know, with Iran—Iran should be very grateful to the United States, because Iran negotiated a fantastic deal with the previous administration, a deal that is unbelievable from any standpoint. Some people don't understand even how it could be even thought of. And instead of being thankful and saying thank you—because they were in serious trouble—I think they would have failed, totally failed within 6 months. We gave them a lifeline, and we not only gave them a lifeline, we gave them wealth and prosperity. And we also gave them an ability to continue with terror and with all of the things they've been doing. Because no matter where we go, we see the signs of Iran in the Middle East.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Everywhere.\nPresident Trump. No matter where we go—whether it's Syria where we were really forced to shoot the 59 missiles a few weeks ago. No matter what area we're in—we see Yemen, Iraq—no matter where we are, we see the signs—every sign—whether it's soldiers, whether it's money and guns, it's Iran.\nAnd instead of saying thank you to the United States, they now feel emboldened. Maybe they figure the deal was so good, we can do it every time. They can't do it, believe me. But it was a terrible, terrible thing for the United States to enter that deal. And believe me, Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. That I can tell you.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you, Mr. President.\n[President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu posed for photographs.]\nQ. Mr. Prime Minister, are you concerned about intelligence cooperation?\nPrime Minister Netanyahu.

I wanted to make a brief statement before we start about things that are probably more important than the numbers. And folks like me sometimes get caught up in the numbers. I want to talk very briefly about what happened in Manchester, England.\nThe President this morning summed it up emotionally for a lot of us who just called these people who perpetrated this -- the one person, there may be more -- \"evil losers.\" The President has -- I think Barron is 11 or 12. I took my son to his first concert when he was 11 or 12. And I think all of us who have children that age and take them to concerts, this is something that hits especially close to home.\nAnd we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our ally and our friends in the UK, and also have the victims and their families in our hearts as we talk about these other things that somehow pale in comparison.\nWith that said, let's talk about the budget. And I know that some of you were here yesterday, and some of what I'll say at the opening will be a repeat. But a lot of folks were not here. So let's talk about what this is.\nThis is the President's FY2018 Budget. The name on the cover is \"The New Foundation for American Greatness.\" As I read through it over the weekend, as I did -- in fact, we've been working on this since before I actually got here -- it struck me that the title should have been different; that the title should have been, \"A Taxpayer First Budget.\" Because that's what this is.\nAnd as I was trying to reconcile those two things -- well, it's called the \"New Foundation for American Greatness,\" but I wanted to call it the \"Taxpayer First Budget,\" that it struck me that that was what was really new, or one of the things that was new about this budget; that we looked at this budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the bills.\nI think for years and years we've simply looked at a budget in terms of the folks who are on the back end of the programs, the recipients of the taxpayer money, and we haven't spent nearly enough time focusing our attention on the people who pay the taxes.\nI got a couple questions yesterday -- I know I will today -- about compassion. Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation. Yes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it. And that is one of the things that is new about this President's budget.\nWhat else is new? It's new in that it balances for the first time in at least 10 years. The last time we looked, we couldn't find a President Obama budget that balanced ever. I think he tried a couple times to convince us that primary balance, which was balance without regard for interest payments on the debt, was balanced. We reject that. We get to an actual balance on this budget within the 10-year window.\nIt begins to reduce the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy in year one, okay? That's how important it was and is to this President to try and bring some fiscal discipline.\nAgain, if you're looking through the perspective of the people who pay, you'd like to be able to tell them at some point in the foreseeable future, you're going to be able to balance. The previous administration completely gave up on that. As I've said before, to the previous administration, if you borrow money -- if I take money from you and I have no intention of ever giving it back, that is not debt. That is theft.\nAnd if we're going to borrow money from people, we have to have a plan for how we are going to pay it back. And that's what this budget does, and that's one of the things that is new about this budget.\nThe next word in the title is foundation. What is the foundation that we're trying to build here? And I sum it up this way -- again, I saw an article a couple weeks ago about \"What is Trumponomics?\" and that Trumponomics is part of the foundation here. What is it? It's sustained, 3 percent economic growth.\nEverything that we do in this administration, every single time I am called into the Oval Office -- whether it's on immigration policy, healthcare policy, tax reform policy, trade policy, budgets and spending -- the focus is sustained, 3 percent economic growth.\nWe have been attacked, stunningly, by some folks on the left and even in the mainstream who say that that's an unreasonable assumption. We should stop and think how absurd that is to think that 3 percent growth in an American economy is to some people an absurd assumption. It used to be normal. Ten years ago it was normal. In fact, it's been normal for the history of the country. I think the average over the 240-odd years that we've been a country has been over 3 percent. It's certainly been over 3 percent since World War II.\nThe 1.9 percent growth rates that the previous administration assumed towards the end of their administration, and the 1.9 percent growth rates for the entire 10-year window that the CBO growth rates assume -- that the CBO assumes, the Congressional Budget Office assumes, are something we simply reject. That is a pessimistic look at what the potential for this country and for what this country's people is. We reject that pessimism.\nAnd so you know what? We probably should have gone in and assumed 3.5 percent or 4 percent growth because that would be aggressive. Three percent growth is just getting back to normal.\nI've said it before, I say it again: If you are 30 years old and you are watching this, or you're sitting here, you have never had a job as an adult in a healthy American economy. It's either been a recession or a slow, sluggish economy stumbling along at less than 2 percent growth.\nThe differences between 2 percent growth and 3 percent growth doesn't sound like much. In fact, I cringe when I hear people say it's only a 1 percent difference. It's not; it's a 50 percent difference. But that's just math. The difference in that is tangible.\nAt 3 percent economic growth in a healthy American economy, if you don't like your job, you can quit because you know you can go get another job. If you get laid off, you know you can go off and start your own business. These are the opportunities that people have forgotten about. And these are the things, the optimism in the country, the dynamism in the country that the President is so eager to push back and to bring back to the country.\nIt's what drives every one of our policies, especially when it comes to anything dealing with jobs and the economy. We will bring back 3 percent economic growth to this country, and those numbers are assumed in this budget.\nBy the way, if you don't, the budget will never balance. If you assume 1.9 percent growth, my guess is you'll never see a balanced budget again. So we refuse to accept that that's the new normal in this country. Three percent is the old normal. Three percent will be the new normal again under the Trump administration. And that is, part and parcel, one of the foundations of this budget.\nAlong those same lines, the budget also speaks to and funds a lot of the President's priorities. We've talked about this since March when we unveiled the budget blueprint. National security, obviously a priority for this President. Border security another priority for him. We can talk at length, if you want today, about the details of the additional money that we spend in those areas.\nThe total plus-up, again, for the 2018 budget is $54 billion over the Congressional Budget Office baseline. The law enforcement gets a significant increase here, and that's both at the federal and the state and local level as we follow through on our efforts to enforce the law.\nVeterans see more money here. That's a classic example of looking at the budget through the eyes of the taxpayer. I put myself in the role of the person who is actually taking the money from you as taxpayer and giving the money to someone else in terms of a benefit. And if I can look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you so that I can help this injured vet, I can do that in good conscience -- I can look you in the eye, and my guess is you're okay with that -- I am a lot less comfortable to the point of not wanting to look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you to give to this person over here who really isn't disabled but is getting a disabled benefit, or this person over here who is supposed to use the money to go to school, but isn't actually going, or a program that is supposed to encourage you to graduate from high school -- or from college, but is only 6 percent effective.\nThat's the type of compassion we talk about, and that's the type of different perspective that we bring to the budget. And it's one of the things that I like to talk about when we talk about the veterans. People don't mind paying their taxes as long as they know that that money is not being wasted and frittered away.\nWe also increase spending for school choice and paid parental leave, making this President the first President of either party to propose a nationwide paid parental leave program for parents and adopted parents. There's $20 billion in that over the course of the 10-year window. I think I gave an incorrect number yesterday of $25 billion.\nWhat are those, by the way? National security, border security, law enforcement, veterans, school choice, paid parental leave. They are all -- all -- campaign promises that the President made while he was running for office.\nAnd that's why I say these numbers are simply the President's policies put onto paper. We took the President's speeches, we took his priorities. We turned them into numbers, and that's what it's in the document.\nIt does not -- along the same lines, not a single thing in here touches Social Security retirement or Medicare. Why? Because that's what the President said when he was campaigning, that he would not change those things.\nIn fact, I've told the story several times of sitting in the President's office with a list of possible reforms to mandatory -- what some people call entitlement spending -- and have the President at the end of the list go: Yes, yes, no, no, no, no. And the \"no, no, no's\" were always Social Security retirement and Medicare. Didn't change those at all because he promised people that he wouldn't.\nWe can do all that and balance at the same time because we look at spending differently. We're no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those programs. We're not going to measure compassion by the amount of money that we spend, but by the number of people that we help.\nAnd that is how you can get 3 percent economic growth. That is how you can balance the budget in 10 years. That is how you can borrow money from people while still promising and intending to pay it back from them. That is how you can help people take charge of their own lives again, and that is the part of the budget that deals with the American greatness.\nSo with that, I'll take questions for a little bit. I know there is a couple. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: So President Trump is sticking to his campaign promise not to touch Medicare or Social Security retirement benefits, but not Medicaid. So how does he intend to square that with his supporters?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: A couple things about Medicaid, and this is one of my favorite stories to tell about Washington spending. Keeping in mind -- and I know that you all probably get this, but if you're watching this at home -- in Washington, D.C., if you spent $100 last year on something, and we spend $100 on it this year -- on that same thing -- in Washington, people call that a cut. $100 last year, $100 this year -- you all call it a cut.\nIn fact, I've seen several occasions where we've spent $100 last year, and $102 this year, and many people will still call that a cut -- because the budget is hard-wired by the Congressional Budget Office to go up every single year. And if the Congressional Budget Office says we spent $100 last year, and we're supposed to spend $106 this year, for a lot of people anything less than $107 is a cut. In fact, I've actually heard $106 referred to as a \"freeze\" because it simply says in line with the Congressional Budget Office. A classic example of how Washington speaks differently than the world back home.\nSo a couple things about Medicaid, okay? There are no Medicaid cuts in the terms of what ordinary human beings would refer to as a cut. We are not spending less money one year than we spent before. What we are doing is growing Medicaid more slowly over the 10-year budget window than the Congressional Budget Office says that we should or says that we will under current law.\nWhy do we change it? We change it -- we change those growth rates in Medicaid spending because of the American Health Care Act, which this President does support. We've said from the very beginning we support the House efforts. We're looking forward to and are working right now with the Senate, working on what their healthcare bill would look like. But we support the American Health Care Act, and that does change Medicaid.\nHow does it change it? And this is something that I don't think enough people are talking about. It makes it a lot better and a lot more able to deliver the necessary services to the people who need it. Here's how: Medicaid is funded in large part by the states. In fact, I was in the state legislature, and our second-largest line item I think after K-12 education was Medicaid. And we would see this program come down from Washington will all of these instructions on how to use it, and say, goodness gracious, this won't work in South Carolina.\nWe happen to think, for example, that Medicaid is designed for more of an urban poor population than a rural poor, as predominates in South Carolina. And we would ask them every single year -- would ask them, the federal government -- give us more control over how this money gets spent. We think we can do it better. We think we can either provide the same services to the same number of people cheaper, or we can provide better service to more people at the same amount of money if you let us do it better. And the federal government always said no. In the American Health Care Act, we say yes, and we give the governors and the state legislatures a lot more control over Medicaid.\nEveryone is interested in seeing the truly needy in their state and in our nation get the care that we promised them in Medicaid. But there's a better way to do it than under current law, which is Obamacare. We can also talk about what a failure that is. But there's a better way to do it, and that's what the American Health Care Act does.\nIn the back. Yes, sir.\nQ: Director Mulvaney, you mentioned the previous administration, the stagnant growth, and that the deficit has actually doubled since 2008 from about $10 trillion to $20 trillion. But a member of that administration, Larry Summers, today actually went on the attack. I'm curious, how do you respond to his assessment of the budget? He called it \"simply ludicrous,\" and that the administration is double-counting the tax cut and the benefit from the growth.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I did get a chance to just see the piece that Mr. Summers wrote, on the way out the door, and the ideas were rushing into my head what I might say to Larry if he were here. So if he's hiding in the back, now would be a good time for him to come out and identify himself.\nI went back and looked at some of the economic assumptions that the Obama administration made in its first couple of years, and I want to say, on a couple of different occasions, their assumed growth rate was more than 4.5 percent. Keep in mind this is the first administration in history -- it was the first decade and the first eight-year period of history not to have a 3 percent growth rate, and yet they were promising us 4.5 percent growth. So if Larry wants to talk about unreasonable assumptions, we talk about my 3 percent growth rate and his 4.5, and we'll talk about who actually is closer to reality.\nRegarding the double-counting, here's one of the things I think that a lot of folks have overlooked. And we did it on purpose because it's sort of hard to count this, and you don't want to make too many assumptions. You have to make assumptions about a budget. You're talking about a document that will look 10 years into the future. So it's natural for administrations from either party to make some assumptions.\nBut one of the assumptions we didn't make was that we didn't close any of the tax gap. For those of you who aren't familiar with that, the tax gap is the amount of money that we should collect in taxes every single year, but don't. 2016 -- that number is $486 billion. Almost enough to close the deficit that year. And we don't assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform. Why is that important? There's probably two reasons that people -- well, three reasons people don't want to pay tax. Number one, they just don't pay tax, and there's always a certain number of people who don't want to do that. Number two, it's just too hard for them to do it. It's too complicated for them to do it. Two reasons. Now I feel like I'm a Monty Python skits. But two reasons.\nAnd we think that --\nQ: Airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Exactly. That if it's a simpler tax code, that people are more likely to pay. That simply makes sense. If you can really fill out your tax reform -- tax returns on a single piece of paper, you're much more likely to actually do it. It's also easier for us to see if you're paying the right amount. A simpler code is easy for you to pay and easy for the government to see if you're paying the right amount, which would allow us very reasonably to assume a reduction in the tax gap. And we don't do a single penny of that.\nSo I'm aware of the criticisms, and I would simply come back and say, look, there's other places where we were probably overly conservative in our accounting. We stand by the numbers. We thought that the assumption that the tax reform would be deficit-neutral was the most reasonable of the three options that we had. We could either assume that our tax reform was deficit-neutral. We could assume it would reduce the deficit. We would assume it would add to the deficit. And given the fact that we're this early in the process about dealing with tax reform, we thought that assuming that middle road was the best way to do it.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Director. Can you characterize the treatment of climate science programs and cuts to those? And do you describe those as a taxpayer waste, if you do not cut them?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: You tell me. I think the National Science Foundation last year used your taxpayer money to fund a climate change musical. Do you think that's a waste of your money?\nQ: What about climate science?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'll take that as a yes, by the way. (Laughter.)\nSo you see my point. What I think you saw happened during the previous administration is the pendulum went too far to one side, where we were spending too much of your money on climate change and not very efficiently. We don't get rid of it here. Do we target it? Sure. Do a lot of the EPA reductions aimed at reducing the focus on climate science? Yes. Does it meant that we are anti-science? Absolutely not. We're simply trying to get things back in order to where we can look at the folks who pay the taxes, and say, look, yeah, we want to do some climate science, but we're not going to do some of the crazy stuff the previous administration did.\nAnd I will note for the record that you didn't say anything about the musical.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you, Director. I'm just wondering -- you were talking about making assumptions. What are your assumptions and expectations for the budget in reference to the wall? I mean, Congress really seems to have come on the record and say they're not in support of funding it. So what are you expectations?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, some folks aren't in support of it, some folks are very much in support of it.\nBy the way, I did read something -- and I was really disappointed yesterday. I don't know if there's anybody here from the folks who broke the embargo. But I thought -- there was only place -- I don't think it was anybody here. Somebody did. But I read the article about how we supposedly dramatically reduced our request for the wall funding. It's not accurate. The 2017 request was $1.5 billion for border security and $3 billion in additional DHS funding. And the request in the -- the proposal in the 2018 is $2.6 billion for border security -- almost twice as much -- and $4.5 billion for total DHS. Again, a much larger number than 2017. So I'm not really sure how the person got to that number.\nBut let me address your question.\nQ: (Inaudible) the wall --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It was. We are absolutely dead serious about the wall. In fact, after taking care of national security and the vets, my guess is, it's in the President's top three. In fact, I know for a fact that it is. And we've made that very clear to the folks on the Hill that while we did not get as much money as we wanted for border security in the 2017 omnibus -- we didn't get a lot; many of you were here for the presentation I gave on that -- that we will see increased border security between today and the end of the calendar year. By the same token, we're going to continue to press on.\nWe do think there's a role for technology, a role for additional people, all of which we asked for in this 2018 budget request. But it is absolutely a priority for the President.\nYes, sir.\nQ: You said you reject the premise of the economy not growing at 3 percent.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yep.\nQ: Did you set the 3 percent target and then reverse-engineer the figures in order to achieve that? Give us the math?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No. Yeah, keep in mind, we had -- because there was a lot of numbers that were floated during the campaign -- 3 percent, 3.5 percent, 4 percent, 4.5 percent -- and we didn't start with any of those numbers and work back. What we sat down and did is this -- in fact, it was the group of -- it was myself, Secretary Mnuchin, Director Cohn from the NEC, who at the time I think was -- still is playing the filling the role often filled by the Council of Economic Advisers. And what we did is we sat down and said -- we looked at the CBO baseline numbers and said, okay, what will our tax policy increase GDP by? What are the ranges for that? What will our regulatory policy impact GDP by? And what could the ranges be for that? What does repealing Obamacare do for increasing GDP?\nBy the way, the Congressional Budget Office actually has hard numbers on that. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that if your repeal Obamacare, it will increase GDP because Obamacare creates a disincentive to work.\nSo we went through the methodology, item by item, and arrived at the 3 percent. And I also think that you'll see that, as well, in the ramp-up to that 3 percent. We don't assume 3 percent in year one, for example. I think the assumption for this year is 2.3 percent, then 2.5 percent, then 2.7 percent or 2.8 percent, and then 3 percent out. So we think it's a very reasonable and very defensible macroeconomic assumption.\nDigging a little bit deeper into the numbers, we also think that our numbers regarding the related interest rates and unemployment rates are likewise defensible. We get a lot of questions, sometimes, about productivity. We hear these stories now -- there was an interesting story in one of the leading newspapers -- I can't remember if was the Times or the Post, yesterday -- about a business in Utah that can't find enough people to work. And people say, oh, how are you going to grow the economy at 3 percent if we're already facing a tight employment market?\nI'm going to pull the numbers up here to I don't butcher these. Of course, as soon as I say that, I can't pull the numbers up. The difference between the U6 rate and the U3 rate is -- I think the number was in excess of 6 million people. What does that mean? The U3 rate is what we call the unemployment rate. It's what everybody calls the unemployment rate. The U6 rate is those folks who are unemployed -- they're in the labor force looking for work but they can't find it -- plus the people who are marginally attached or are working part-time for economic reasons, working part-time because they can't find full-time work. That difference, that delta, is over 6 million people. So we believe that we should be able to drive U3 and U6 together and get those folks into full-time employment. And that's one of the ways you get productivity gains.\nQ: You're saying that U6, a measure that goes back to 1994, you can have it equal to U3 measure?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: In a properly functioning economy, that would be the case. Because keep in mind, what's the difference? Marginally attached and part-time against your will. You want to work full-time, but you're not. So you're technically not unemployed, because that's not the technical definition of the U3 unemployment rate, but you want to be doing more, you want to be more productive, to go back to the economic terms. And we do believe that if we bring those people back to the job place, they will end up adding to productivity.\nQ: Director Mulvaney, thanks for doing this. On the day that he came down the escalator, famously, and became candidate Trump, he said, \"We're going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.\" I recognize that he's going to be saving Social Security retirement, but he's not saving Social Security disability insurance, which benefits more than 10 million Americans. So is the President keeping his promise on that program?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thank you for that. Yes, he absolutely is. And here's why. The fact that it's called Social Security disability insurance I think is -- well, I'll put it to you this way. We propose to do parental paid leave in this budget. Again, the first President of either party to do that. We propose to do that using the tools that already exist through the state unemployment insurance. By the way, I think that's similar to the way that Canada does it now.\nThere are a couple of states -- New York, New Jersey, I think California -- who already provide statewide paid parental leave. They do it through their disability insurance programs, their employment disability. That does not mean that parental leave is unemployment, and it does not mean that parental leave is a disability. It simply means that that program is managed through the infrastructure that already existed at the time it was set up.\nAnd the same is true with Social Security disability. It is a welfare program for the long-term disabled. It is not what most people would consider to be Social Security.\nQ: So why do those individuals who presently receive SSDI receive less as a result of this budget?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I hope so -- if there are people who are getting SSDI who should not be getting it --\nQ: Those people who should be getting, will they receive less?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, no, if people are really disabled and there are folks who need this program --\nQ: So how are you going to determine who is getting it that shouldn't be getting it? So many antifraud programs that exist already.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, that's a great question, and I could get down in the weeds. But one of the -- we have -- one of the proposals we have is actually how we pick the administrative law judges to make -- because I think it's a lifetime appointment on day one, and we try to phase them in to make sure that they're not -- there have been several judges accused of sort of abusing the program.\nBut to your point -- your point is an excellent one -- we are not kicking anybody off of any program who really needs it. That's not -- we have plenty of money in this country to take care of the people who need help. Okay? And we will do that. We don't have enough money to take care of people, everybody who doesn't need help. So what we try and do is look at these programs -- again, through the perspective of the people paying for it -- and say, SNAP, for example -- I know I haven't been asked a question about it --\nQ: But wouldn't 42 million Americans benefit from SNAP?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: 42 million Americans? I thought it was 44; I'll take your word for it on 42.\nQ: It's in the neighborhood.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: It is. I think the high was 47, and that was during the recession. Pre-recession, the numbers were as 28. It spiked during the recession, which you would expect on a countercyclical program like food stamps. During bad economic times, more people will go onto food stamps. So it's completely within reason to look at that number -- it went from 28 million on food stamps before the recession to 47 million at the height. It's 44 or 42 today. Yet here we are, eight years removed from the end of the recession. We've had economic growth, albeit slow. We're at what we consider to be full employment, with the limitations of U3 and U6. Why is the number still that high?\nIs it possible -- if you're paying for it, isn't it reasonable for you to at least ask the question, are there people on that program who shouldn't be on there? And shouldn't it be up to the government to make sure we can look folks who are paying the taxes in the eye and say, you know what, we did everything we could to make sure that everybody on SSDI is really disabled. We don't think that's unreasonable. In fact, we think that is the definition of compassionate -- a compassion that is balanced between the people who get the benefits and the people who pay them.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you talk about provisions affecting federal employees and how to strengthen -- your plans to strengthen the federal government?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'll deal with federal -- let's talk about federal retirement, because that's gotten a little bit of a -- and that's one of our largest changes. Simply put, we try and make federal retirement closer -- closer to the private sector. So we've increased the contributions that they make to their 401(k) programs. I think on one program we got rid of a cost-of-living adjustment that was there. But keep in mind, those are folks who will also be participating in Social Security at the same time, which is cost-of-living adjusted. So we thought they were common-sense reforms to try and bring the federal government benefit programs closer to the private sector.\nI'm a federal worker. I have a pension and a 401(k). Raise your hand if you're in the private sector and you have a pension and a 401(k). My guess is -- oh, one did. Did you really? In the back? Okay, all right. So she wanted to ask the next question. So we're simply trying to get some common sense back into that program. And we don't think that's an unreasonable thing to do. Again, it's the right thing to do on behalf of the taxpayers.\nIn the back. Yes, sir.\nQ: Can you talk about the $1.6 billion for brick and mortar for border security? What are the American people going to see with that money? Are we talking about more replacement wall, new wall? And if so, how much new wall?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Just to be clear, the $1.5 billion was the request for 2017; $2.6 billion is the request for 2018, reflecting the fact that there are 12 months in 2018; there was only five months in 2017 when we were dealing with that.\nSo the answer to your question -- what they're going to see is, all of the above. That would be replacement wall. That would be new wall. That would be land acquisition. That would be infrastructure. Keep in mind you can't just -- you don't automatically, magically build a wall in the middle of nowhere. You have to build a road to get there. You often have to run utility services out if you're going to do lighting, for example.\nSo it's all of the above, and part of the President's commitment. We haven't decided yet on the best kind of wall. I think we're going through a competition right now, and I think there are either four or eight -- and I lose track; it depends on how you want to count it -- different prototypes that are in the process of being designed and built right now as we try and figure out what the most appropriate type of wall is. And it may well be -- by the way, we fully expect that different barriers will serve best in different areas.\nQ: A quick follow-up. Are you projecting out -- a lot of this budget has to do with projections as many as 10 years out. Are you projecting out how much money you're going to need in the following years to complete the President's promise during the campaign?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: We don't -- the way this works -- and it's a great question -- keep in mind, the federal budget is a budget in name only. It's really its own thing. I guess they called it a budget because they didn't know what else to call it. But it's got two big pieces to it. It has a spending proposal for the first year, and that's where you get a good bit of detail. And then you have these policies and broader-brush sort of approaches for the next years, two through ten. So the answer to your question is, yes, we get very specific in where we would spend DHS money in 2018, but as you go further and further away, we get less specific. We do plug in numbers, for example, for DHS, but we don't say what number that would be for.\nI'll take the last question.\nQ: I have an energy question for you. I wanted to ask about the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and the proposal to sell off half of the stocks. How concerned are you that doing that would hurt domestic producers by pressuring prices lower? And does the administration plan to break with its agreement with other OECD nations to keep 90 days' worth of oil supplies in reserves?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't speak to the OECD because I'm not familiar with that. What I will tell you is we do not believe that the proposals that we've got would harm the domestic production ability. In fact, one of the reasons we believe that we can reduce --\nQ: -- prices.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Prices. And of course, if you do it slowly, if you telegraph it over the course of time, there's a way to do it without having a dramatic impact on prices.\nBy the way, what she's talking about is we proposed to reduce the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was put in place back in the 1970s. It may have been the early 1980s by the time that actually got funded. And at that time, I think we were importing over 6 million barrels of oil a day from the Middle East and we had limited domestic production. That's why you do it, right? It was a national security argument -- if we're going to rely so heavily on imported oil, then there might be a national security, and certainly an economic argument, to not exposing ourselves to the risks like the oil shocks that we had in the 1970s.\nThat risk goes down dramatically when we have increased domestic production like we do today. Like we just saw Congress last year approve for the first time since the 1970s crude oil exports out of this country. So we have the opportunity now to do that. We also produce more oil because of hydraulic fracking. We also produce more natural gas and other hydrocarbons.\nSo we think it's a responsible thing to do. It's no longer necessary. Again, go back to that perception of the taxpayers. I don't need to take this much of your money to bury in the ground out in West Texas someplace for domestic security and national security reasons when we have domestic surpluses -- supplies like we do.\nQ: Can I ask a question on SNAP?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thank you all very much. Again, we'll be available for questions. You can reach out to -- SNAP -- I will. Thank you for that. We'll take SNAP. Then I will go. Thank you. I've talked about it a little bit, but go ahead. What's your -- I thought I answered the SNAP question.\nQ: You touched on it, but I have a follow-up from yesterday. You said that you would be phasing in the work requirements. And I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about that process and how quickly you expect that to happen? And also, if you could, tell us what you would say to the able-bodied Americans you referenced who are saying, I want to work, but I can't find work?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The answer to your question is, I'm not familiar with the details of how we phase it in over time. So I apologize, we'll have to get back to you on that one. But in terms of what we'd say to people is, great, thank you, thank you for wanting to work, because we need you as a nation to do that. So we are starting on the exact same page. So we are going to do everything we can to help you find a job that you are suited to and a job that you can use to help take care of you, yourself, and your family.\nNow, that's not the problem. Okay? Folks who are out there who are on food stamps and want to work, we'll be able to work with them to solve the problem. They are not what's causing the difficulties in SNAP. It's the folks who are on there who don't want to work. And that's what we're trying to point out to people, is, look, if there's 44 million people on there, eight years from the end of the recession, maybe, maybe it's reasonable to ask if there are folks who are on there who shouldn't be. That is a reasonable question to ask. I would even suggest to you it's a compassionate question to ask.\nBut I can assure you, if you're in this country and you want to work, there's good news, because Donald Trump is President and we're going to get 3 percent growth, and we're going to give you the opportunity to go back to work.\nSo thank you all very much.

In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful, Your Excellency, Mr. President and dear friend, Donald Trump, it's my pleasure to welcome you here in Palestine and receive you as a great guest of our people here in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus—peace be upon Him—from which the message of love, peace, and tolerance has spread out all across the globe.\nAllow me at the beginning to condemn the horrible terrorist attack that occurred in Manchester city—the British city of Manchester, leaving tens of casualties and innocent people. I do offer my warm condolences to the Prime Minister of Britain, families of victims, and the British people.\nYour Excellency, meeting you in the White House early this month has given us and our Palestinian people—as well has also given all the nations across the region—so much hope and optimism of the possibility to make true a dream, a long-awaited dream and ambition, and that is lasting and justice-based peace.\nOur people—Palestinian people's attainment of their freedom and independence is the key to peace and stability in the world, so that the children of Palestine and Israel enjoy a safe, stable, and prosperous future.\nI would like to reiterate, Your Excellency, Mr. President, our commitment to cooperate with you in order to make peace and forge a historic peace deal with the Israelis. And we would like to reassert our willingness to continue to work with you as partners in fighting terrorism in our region and in the world. In this respect, I commend the importance of the holding of the Arab Islamic American Summit and its findings and outcomes and conclusions.\nYour Excellency, Mr. President, once again we reassert to you our positions of accepting the two-state solution along the borders of 1967, the state of Palestine with its capital as East Jerusalem, living alongside the State of Israel in peace and security and good neighborhood, as well as resolving the entire final status issues based on international law and internationally legitimate resolutions and respecting side agreements which sets the tone for the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative in accordance with what has been reaffirmed in the most recent Arab summit in Jordan.\nYour Excellency, as you have witnessed during your—as you saw yesterday during your historic visit of holy sites in occupied East Jerusalem and today in Bethlehem, the conflict is not between religions, for respecting religions and prophets is an integral part of our religion and faith. And we are keen to keep the door open to dialogue with our Israeli neighbors from all walks of life in order to boost confidence and create a genuine peace opportunity.\nOur fundamental problem is with the occupation and settlements and failure of Israel to recognize the state of Palestine in the same way we recognize it, which undermines the realization of the two-state solution. Our—the problem is not with—between us and Judaism, it's between us and occupation.\nI would like to draw the attention to the issue of our Palestinian prisoners, who have been on hunger strike for more than 1 month, meters away from here in the vicinity of the Church of Nativity. And everywhere, all across Palestine, families, mothers of prisoners, suffer from being denied visits to their children. And their demands are humane and just. I demand the Israeli Government to meet these humane, legitimate demands.\nAchievement of peace, Your Excellency, the President, will give us broad horizons and prospects to recover our economy and continue building our national institutions based on rule of law and with—in the spirit of tolerance and coexistence and a culture of peace, nonviolence, no incitement, and building bridges instead of walls inside our lands.\nOnce again, I greet you with the warmest regards, Your Excellency, the President, and your accompanying delegation. I welcome you in Palestine, the Holy Land, wishing you success in your important tour, which will lead you to meeting His Holiness, the Pope, Francis, and whose efforts—whose dedicated, devoted efforts for peace we appreciate. Wishing you and our—the friendly American people a long lifetime of health and happiness.\n[At this point, President Abbas spoke in English as follows.]\nMr. President, Donald Trump—[inaudible]—to achieve peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Mr. President, I extend my hand to you in welcome on this noble and—[inaudible]—mission.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much.\nBombing at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, United Kingdom\nAs President of the United States, on behalf of the people of the United States, I would like to begin by offering my prayers to the people of Manchester in the United Kingdom. I extend my deepest condolences to those so terribly injured in this terrorist attack and to the many killed and the families—so many families—of the victims.\nWe stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life. I won't call them monsters, because they would like that term. They would think that's a great name. I will call them from now on losers because that's what's they are. They're losers. And we'll have more of them. But they're losers, just remember that.\nThis is what I've spent these last few days talking about during my trip overseas. Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed, we cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people. And in today's attack, it was mostly innocent children.\nThe terrorists and extremists—and those who give them aid and comfort—must be driven out from our society forever. This wicked ideology must be obliterated—and I mean completely obliterated—and the innocent life must be protected, all innocent lives. Life must be protected. All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace.\nPresident Trump's Visit to the Palestinian Territories I want to offer my deep appreciation to the Palestinians and President Abbas for hosting me today. It's an honor to join you in Bethlehem, the city that is precious to people from all over the world. It's a precious city.\nAs I discussed with President Abbas in Washington earlier this month, I am committed to trying to achieve a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and I intend to do everything I can to help them achieve that goal. President Abbas assures me he is ready to work toward that goal in good faith. And Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised the same. I look forward to working with these leaders toward a lasting peace.\nI also look forward to working with President Abbas on other important matters, such as unlocking the potential of the Palestinian economy—which is having a very rough time—and building on our very positive counterterrorism efforts.\nSeveral days ago in Saudi Arabia, I met with the leaders of the Muslim world and Arab nations from all across the region. It was an epic gathering. It was a historic event. King Salman of Saudi Arabia could not have been kinder, and I will tell you, he's a very wise, wise man. I called on these leaders and asked them to join in a partnership to drive terrorism from their midst once and for all.\nIt was a deeply productive meeting. People have said there has really never been anything even close in history. I believe that. Being there and seeing who was there and hearing the spirit and a lot of love, there has never been anything like that in history. And it was an honor to be involved. But great things can come from that meeting.\nI was gratified that President Abbas joined the summit and committed to taking firm but necessary steps to fight terrorism and confront its hateful ideology. And it's so interesting that our meeting took place on this very horrible morning of death to innocent young people.\nPeace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded and even rewarded. We must be resolute in condemning such acts in a single, unified voice. Peace is a choice we must make each day, and the United States is here to help make that dream possible for young Jewish, Christian, and Muslim children all across the region. In so doing, we will all enjoy a safer and brighter future and a safer and brighter world.\nIn this spirit of hope, we come to Bethlehem, asking God for a more peaceful, safe, and far more tolerant world for all of us. I am truly hopeful that America can help Israel and the Palestinians forge peace, and bring new hope to the region and its people. I also firmly believe that if Israel and the Palestinians can make peace, it will begin a process of peace all throughout the Middle East. And that would be an amazing accomplishment.\nThank you very much.

Two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were sent to their deaths. Words can never describe the bottomless depths of that evil or the scope of the anguish and destruction.\nIt was history's darkest hour. Millions of innocent, wonderful, and beautiful lives—men, women, and children—were extinguished as part of a systematic attempt to eliminate the Jewish people. It was the most savage crime against God and his children. And it is our solemn duty to remember, to mourn, to grieve, and to honor every single life that was so cruelly and viciously taken.\nAs Elie Wiesel said: \"For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.\" These words should be carved into the conscience of humanity forever. Only when we remember the families who were torn apart from everyone they loved, who suffered that terrible darkness and evil, who endured the unbearable horror of the Holocaust, only then can we prevent this agony from ever repeating.\nThis place and this entire nation are a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people and the hope that light can shine the path beyond the darkness. Through persecution, oppression, death, and destruction, the Jewish people have persevered. They have thrived. They've become so successful in so many places. And they have enlightened the world. The State of Israel is a strong and soaring monument to the solemn pledge we repeat and affirm: never again. From the depths of the suffering, the Jewish people have built a mighty nation, and the Star of David waves proudly above this cherished land.\nAs long as we refuse to be silent in the face of evil, as long as we refuse to dim the light of truth in the midst of darkness, as long as we refuse to become bystanders to barbarity, then we know that goodness, peace, and justice will ultimately prevail.\nWith sadness for the lives and dreams that were stolen from this Earth, with determination to always keep the memories of the victims alive, and with resolve to confront evil wherever it threatens, we ask God to give us the strength, wisdom, and courage to chart the righteous path.\nThank you. God bless the memory of the perished. God bless the survivors. God bless the Jewish people. And God bless the State of Israel. Thank you for having me.

It's very nice. And thank you to Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I also want to thank Sara for hosting us last night in really a very unforgettable dinner. We had a great time. We talked about a lot of very, very important things. And thank you to Ambassador David Friedman and Mrs. Friedman for joining us, along with a number of very good friends who have come from our country to yours, as we reaffirm the unshakable bond between the United States of America and Israel. Thank you.\nI'd like to begin my remarks today by sending the thoughts and prayers of the entire American people to the victims of the terrorist attack in Manchester. You know—you've all been watching. You've seen just a horrible thing going on. I want to send our condolences to the many families who lost their loved ones. Horrific, horrific injuries. Terrible. Dozens of innocent people, beautiful young children savagely murdered in this heinous attack upon humanity. I repeat again that we must drive out the terrorists and the extremists from our midst, obliterate this evil ideology, and protect and defend our citizens and people of the world.\nAll civilized nations much be united in this effort. This trip is focused on that goal: bringing nations together around the goal of defeating the terrorism that threatens the world and crushing the hateful ideology that drives it so hard and seems to be driving it so fast.\nIt is a privilege to stand here in this national museum in the ancient city of Jerusalem to address the Israeli people and all people in the Middle East who yearn for security, prosperity and peace. Jerusalem is a sacred city. Its beauty, splendor, and heritage are like no other place on Earth. The ties—[applause]—true. What a heritage. What a heritage. The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal. They date back thousands of years, including the reign of King David whose star now flies proudly on Israel's white and blue flag.\nYesterday I visited the Western Wall and marveled at the monument to God's presence and man's perseverance. I was humbled to place my hand upon the wall and to pray in that holy space for wisdom from God. I also visited and prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a site revered by Christians throughout the world. I laid a wreath at Yad Vashem, honoring, remembering, and mourning the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. I pledged right then and there what I pledge again today: the words \"never again.\"\nIsrael is a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people. From all parts of this great country, one message resounds, and that is the message of hope. Down through the ages, the Jewish people have suffered persecution, oppression, and even those who have sought their destruction. But through it all, they have endured, and in fact, they have thrived. I stand in awe of the accomplishments of the Jewish people, and I make this promise to you: My administration will always stand with Israel. [Applause] Thank you very much.\nThrough your hardships, you have created one of the most abundant lands anywhere in the world, a land that is rich not only in history, culture, and opportunity, but especially in spirit. This museum where we are gathered today tells the story of that spirit. From the two Holy Temples, to the glorious heights of Masada, we see an incredible story of faith and perseverance. That faith is what inspired Jews to believe in their destiny, to overcome their despair, and to build here—right here—a future that others dared not even to dream.\nIn Israel, not only are Jews free to till the soil, teach their children, and pray to God in the ancient land of their fathers—and they love this land, and they love God—but Muslims, Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and to follow their dreams, right here.\nToday, gathered with friends, I call upon all people—Jews, Christians, Muslims, and every faith, every tribe, every creed—to draw inspiration from this ancient city, to set aside our sectarian differences, to overcome oppression and hatred, and to give all children the freedom and hope and dignity written into our souls.\nEarlier this week, I spoke at a very historic summit in Saudi Arabia. I was hosted by King Salman, a very wise man. There, I urged our friends in the Muslim world to join us in creating stability, safety, and security. And I was deeply encouraged by the desire of many leaders to join us in cooperation toward these shared and vital goals.\nConflict cannot continue forever. The only question is when nations will decide that they have had enough: enough bloodshed, enough killing. That historic summit represents a new opportunity for people throughout the Middle East to overcome sectarian and religious divisions, to extinguish the fires of extremism, and to find common ground and shared responsibility in making the future of this region so much better than it is right now.\nChange must come from within. It can only come from within. No mother or father wants their children to grow up in a world where terrorists roam free, schoolchildren are murdered, and their loved ones are taken. No child is born with prejudice in their heart. No one should teach young boys and girls to hate and to kill. No civilized nation can tolerate the massacre of innocents with chemical weapons.\nMy message to that summit was the same message I have for you: We must build a coalition of partners who share the aim of stamping out extremism and violence and providing our children a peaceful and hopeful future. But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the State of Israel. And on behalf of the United States, we pledge to stand by you and defend our shared values so that together we can defeat terrorism and create safety for all of God's children.\nIsraelis have experienced firsthand the hatred and terror of radical violence. Israelis are murdered by terrorists wielding knives and bombs. Hamas and Hizballah launch rockets into Israeli communities where schoolchildren have to be trained to hear the sirens and to run to the bomb shelters, with fear, but with speed. ISIS targets Jewish neighborhoods, synagogues, and storefronts. And Iran's leaders routinely call for Israel's destruction. Not with Donald J. Trump, believe me. [Applause] Thank you. I like you too. [Laughter]\nDespite these challenges, Israel is thriving as a sovereign nation, and no international body should question the contributions Israel makes to the region and, indeed, the world. Today let us pray for that peace and for a more hopeful future across the Middle East.\nThere are those who present a false choice. They say that we must choose between supporting Israel and supporting Arab and Muslim nations in the region. That is completely wrong. All decent people want to live in peace, and all humanity is threatened by the evils of terrorism. Diverse nations can unite around the goal of protecting innocent life, upholding human dignity, and promoting peace and stability in the region. My administration is committed to pursuing such a coalition, and we have already made substantial progress during this trip. We know, for instance, that both Israelis and Palestinians seek lives of hope for their children. And we know that peace is possible if we put aside the pain and disagreements of the past and commit together to finally resolving this crisis, which has dragged on for nearly half a century or more.\nAs I have repeatedly said, I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement, and I had a meeting this morning with President Abbas and can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace. I know you've heard it before. I am telling you—that's what I do—they are ready to reach for peace.\nIn my meeting with my very good friend, Benjamin, I can tell you also that he is reaching for peace. He wants peace. He loves people. He especially loves the Israeli people. Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace.\nMaking peace, however, will not be easy. We all know that. Both sides will face tough decisions. But with determination, compromise, and the belief that peace is possible, Israelis and Palestinians can make a deal.\nBut even as we work toward peace, we will build strength to defend our Nation. The United States is firmly committed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and halting their support of terrorists and militias. So we are telling you right now that Iran will not have nuclear weapons.\nAmerica's security partnership with Israel is stronger than ever. Under my administration, you see the difference—big, big beautiful difference—[laughter]—including the Iron Dome missile defense program, which has been keeping the Israeli people safe from short-range rockets launched by Hizballah and Hamas, and David's Sling, which guards against long-range missiles. It is my hope that someday, very soon, Israeli children will never need to rush towards shelters again as sirens ring out loud and clear.\nFinally, the United States is proud that Israeli Air Force pilots are flying the incredible, new American F-35 planes. There is nothing in the world like them to defend their nation, and it was wonderful to see these mighty aircraft in the skies over Israel recently as you celebrated the 69th anniversary of Israel's independence.\nBut even as we strengthen our partnership in practice, let us always remember our highest ideals. Let us never forget that the bond between our two nations is woven together in the hearts of our people and their love of freedom, hope, and dignity for every man and every woman. Let us dream of a future where Jewish, Muslim, and Christian children can grow up together and live together in trust, harmony, tolerance, and respect.\nThe values that practiced in Israel have inspired millions and millions of people all across the world. The conviction of Theodor Herzl rings true today: \"Whatever we attempt there for our own benefit will rebound mightily and beneficially to the good of all mankind.\"\nAs we stand in Jerusalem, we see pilgrims of all faiths coming to this land to walk on this hallowed ground. Jews place the prayers from their hearts in the stone blocks of the beautiful Western Wall. Christians pray in the pews of an ancient church. Muslims answer the call to prayer at their holy sites. This city, like no other place in the world, reveals the longing of human hearts to know and to worship God.\nJerusalem stands as a reminder that life can flourish against any odds. When we look around this city—so beautiful—and we see people of all faiths engaged in reverent worship and schoolchildren learning side by side and men and women lifting up the needy and forgotten, we see that God's promise of healing has brought goodness to so many lives. We see that the people of this land had the courage to overcome the oppression and injustice of the past and to live in the freedom God intends for every person on this Earth.\nToday, in Jerusalem, we pray and we hope that children around the world will be able to live without fear, to dream without limits, and to prosper without violence. I ask this land of promise to join me to fight our common enemies, to pursue our shared values, and to protect the dignity of every child of God.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the State of Israel. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-05-23", "title": "Remarks at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem"}

At the invitation of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the King of Saudi Arabia, President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America made an official visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from Saturday, May 20, 2017 to Monday, May 22, 2017. 2. During the visit, the two leaders reviewed the strong historical and strategic relations between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which have grown and flourished over the past eight decades in the political, economic, cultural, military, security, energy, and other fields. The leaders observed that the two countries have developed a productive partnership built upon trust, cooperation, and shared interests. 3. The two leaders praised the contribution of this visit to strengthening the relations between the two countries, in order to achieve greater stability, security, and prosperity. The leaders declared that they stand together to thwart our common enemies, to strengthen the bonds between us, and to chart a path towards peace and prosperity for all. 4. The two leaders agreed to a new Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century in the interest of both countries by formally announcing a Joint Strategic Vision for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States of America, charting a renewed path toward a peaceful Middle East where economic development, trade, and diplomacy are hallmarks of regional and global engagement. 5. The two countries announced their plan to form a Strategic Joint Consultative Group, hosted by the King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the President of the United States of America, or their appropriate designees, to chart the course of this strategic partnership. 6. The two countries agreed the Strategic Joint Consultative Group will meet at least once a year, alternating between the two countries, and it will review areas of cooperation. 7. The two countries shared a desire to address the threats to their shared security interests. Thus, the two countries sought to embark on new initiatives to counter violent extremist messaging, disrupt financing of terrorism, and advance defense cooperation. 8. The two sides expressed their desire to expand cooperation and hope that responsible governments willing to commit to peace will build upon their efforts to realize these objectives. The two sides predicted that violent extremists who threaten peace in the Middle East will find a growing group of regional partners arrayed against them, confronting their aggression and sowing the seeds of peace. 9. The two sides acknowledged that a robust, integrated regional security architecture is critical to their cooperation. The United States of America and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia intend to expand engagement with other countries in the region over the coming years and to identify new areas of cooperation. 10. The leaders welcomed achievements during this visit, including the signing of a number of agreements and memoranda of understanding that will be fruitful for the peoples of the two countries and future generations, promoting security, stability, and prosperity in the region. 11. The two leaders noted the growing and advanced volume of trade between the two countries, joint investments in economic projects and infrastructure, and the provision of facilities and incentives for these investments. 12. The two leaders also indicated that this strategic partnership and economic and investment cooperation will generate a large number of high-quality jobs in both countries. 13. The two leaders stressed the importance of investment in energy by companies in both countries, and the importance of coordinating policies that ensure the stability of markets and an abundance of supplies. 14. The two leaders discussed the close cooperation between both countries to ensure the preservation of maritime security, including protecting the safety of navigation in key international waterways, particularly Bab al-Mandab and the Strait of Hormuz. 15. The two leaders affirmed their determination to eliminate Daesh (also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS), al Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations and to fight terrorism using all instruments. 16. The two leaders expressed the commitment of their countries to vigorously confront the attempts of terrorist organizations to legitimize their criminality, and to counter the roots of terrorist ideology. 17. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to broad security cooperation and exchange of information to serve their interests and safeguard their security. 18. The two leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to curb the flow of foreign fighters and cutting off funding supplies for terrorist organizations. 19. The two leaders noted Saudi Arabia's achievement in detecting and disrupting 276 terrorist plots prior to their execution, including operations against the United States and friendly countries. 20. President Trump praised the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in deterring terrorist organizations' attempts to target the Kingdom, pointing out the attempts of terrorist organizations to cause a rift in relations between the two countries. The Kingdom was one of the first countries to suffer from terrorism; since 1992, more than 100 terrorist attacks have occurred in Saudi Arabia. 21. The two leaders affirmed their determination to unite and integrate efforts between the United States-led Global Coalition Against ISIS with Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism. 22. The two leaders also agreed on the need to contain Iran's malign interference in the internal affairs of other states, instigation of sectarian strife, support of terrorism and armed proxies, and efforts to destabilize the countries in the region. 23. The two leaders also stressed that Iran's interference poses a threat to the security of the region and the world, and that the nuclear agreement with Iran needs to be re-examined in some of its clauses. The Iranian ballistic missile program poses a threat, not only to neighboring countries, but also a direct threat to the security of all countries in the region as well as global security. 24. The two sides also stressed the importance of reaching a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The leaders agreed to do everything they can to promote an environment that is conducive to advancing peace. 25. The two sides stressed the need to work to resolve the crisis in Yemen. President Trump commended the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for providing humanitarian and relief aid to the Yemeni people. 26. As for the crisis in Syria, the Kingdom stressed its support for President Trump's decision to launch missiles at Shayrat Airbase from which the Syrian regime launched its chemical attacks on Khan Shaykhun. The two sides emphasized the importance that the Syrian regime adhere to the 2013 agreement to eliminate its entire stockpile of chemical weapons. The two sides emphasized the importance of reaching a permanent solution to the conflict in Syria based on the Geneva declaration and Security Council resolution 2254, in order to maintain the unity and integrity of Syrian territory so that it can be a country that represents the entire spectrum of the Syrian community and free from sectarian discrimination. 27. The two leaders expressed their support for the Iraqi government's efforts to eradicate ISIS, uniting the Iraqis to combat terrorism that poses a threat to all Iraq, and preserving the unity and integrity of Iraqi territory, as well as the importance of stopping Iranian interference in Iraqi internal affairs. The two sides noted the importance of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and seeking to develop them further. 28. Regarding Lebanon, the two sides stressed the importance of supporting the Lebanese state in enforcing its sovereignty on all of its territory, disarm terrorist organizations such as Hizballah, and bring all weapons under the legitimate supervision of the Lebanese army.", "timestamp": "2017-05-23", "title": "Joint Statement by President Trump and King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia"}

The leaders renewed their determination to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism, eliminate its organizations, prosecute its members, and dry up its sources of funding. 15. They also stressed the importance of working together to confront terrorist threats and combat terrorism financing, with more measures, including protecting infrastructure facilities and enhancing border and aviation security. The United States welcomed the establishment of the Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, founded by Saudi Arabia, as part of the global fight against terrorism. 16. The leaders praised the efforts of the United States-led Global Coalition Against ISIS, or Daesh, in Syria and Iraq, and stressed the need for concerted efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance to Iraqi and Syrian refugees and displaced persons. 17. The leaders expressed their total rejection of Iran's continued interference in the internal affairs of GCC states and the region, and called for full compliance with the rules of international law and its basic underpinnings, foundations and principles, which are based on good neighborliness, respect for the sovereignty of states, and refraining from threating the use of force. They called on Iran to take concrete, practical steps to build trust and resolve its differences with neighbors by peaceful means. 18. They expressed their condemnation of Iran's interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region, in violation of the sovereignty of the GCC States, and its attempt to spread division and stir sectarian strife among their citizens, including in the Kingdom of Bahrain, by supporting violent extremists, training proxies, smuggling weapons and explosives, inciting sectarian strife, and making statements at various levels to undermine security, order and stability. 19. They also stressed the need for Iran to comply with the nuclear agreement, and expressed their deep concern over Iran's continued firing of ballistic missiles, in clear defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. 20. The leaders committed to working together to achieve a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The leaders agreed to do everything they can to promote an environment that is conducive to advancing peace. 21. The leaders affirmed their firm position to preserve the unity, stability and territorial integrity of Syria and expressed their support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General's envoy to find a political solution based on Geneva 1 Communique and United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, and stressed the need to lift the siege on besieged Syrian cities, the delivery of humanitarian aid to affected areas and besieged civilians, the cessation of shelling of civilian areas, and the release of detainees. 22. The leaders affirmed their full commitment to the unity of Yemen, respect for its sovereignty and independence, and the rejection of any interference with its internal affairs. They also stressed the importance of a political solution according to the Gulf Initiative and its executive mechanism, and implementation of United Nations Security Council decisions. They expressed their great appreciation for the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen to resume consultations between the Yemeni parties with the view toward reaching a political solution. 23. The leaders affirmed their commitment to work with the international community to prevent the continued supply of weapons to Houthi militias and their allies. They also stressed the need for collective efforts to confront the affiliates of al-Qaeda and Daesh or ISIS in the Arabian Peninsula. 24. The leaders expressed their concern about the continuation of the Houthi militia's confiscation of humanitarian and relief materials, which contributed to the deterioration of the humanitarian and economic situation in Yemen, and welcomed the results of the donor conference held in Geneva on April 25, 2017, stressing the need for quick fulfillment of the commitments made by donor countries. The leaders look forward to working together to restore security and stability, rehabilitate the Yemeni economy and restore public services after reaching a political solution. 25. The leaders expressed their hope that the process of liberating Mosul will lead to the return of displaced persons to their cities and villages, and to finding a comprehensive political reform process that brings together the Iraqi people without exclusion or dispersion to meet the aspirations of the Iraqi people. 26. The leaders agreed to strengthen and support economic relations in various fields, including trade and investment, energy and alternative energy, industry, technology, agriculture, transportation and infrastructure development, in line with the development visions adopted by GCC countries. 27. The leaders agreed to meet annually in this format to review progress made on all the initiatives agreed upon during the Summit and to look for further ways to strengthen GCC-US Strategic Partnership.", "timestamp": "2017-05-23", "title": "Joint Statement on the Extraordinary Summit of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the United States of America"}

(Applause.)\nThank you all for coming out today. You know, I just spoke to the President. He arrived in Brussels just a few short hours ago, after a historic meeting with Pope Francis in Rome. He's arrived in Europe now to reaffirm our commitment to NATO. Earlier this week, he was in Saudi Arabia across the Middle East, visited our most cherished ally Israel. And all along the way, he's been strengthening relationships and alliances throughout the world.\nThe American people are witnessing the strong leadership of President Trump on the world stage, and the world is seeing that President Donald Trump is stepping into the role of leader of the free world, and he is leading for America. (Applause.)\nNow, before I continue, allow me to take a moment to just speak a few words about the horrific terrorist attack in Manchester, England, this past Monday night.\n? Our hearts break for the families of the victims and the injured, and they are all in our prayers. And let me say with deep conviction, the United States stands in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom in their loss, and in our shared determination to protect our people and rid the world of the threat of terrorist violence. (Applause.)\nThank you for letting me share that. It is great to be back in the Pelican State. And I thank you all for coming out on a busy afternoon. And everybody keeps telling me the weather isn't always like this in Louisiana. (Laughter.) So thanks for sparing such a beautiful day.\nTo Administrator Verma, thank you for that kind introduction, thank you for your leadership at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nLet me also like to thank Congressman Garret Graves for joining us, and for representing Louisiana with such conservative principle in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nAnd I also want to thank the whole team here at Cajun Industries, Todd Grigsby and the family for hosting us here today. For nearly 45 years, Cajun Industries has built Louisiana, and every day you're building the American Dream for families all across this region. President Trump and I couldn't be more proud of all that you've accomplished and by your hospitality today. So give a big round of applause, would you, for Cajun Industries and all the great team that's here? (Applause.)\nNow I'm sure one of the secrets of the success of this company is they know how to make a budget work, and so does President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nJust yesterday, our administration unveiled the President's first budget, and it's exactly what Louisiana elected him to do.\nThe President's plan puts America back on a path to fiscal responsibility. In fact, the President's budget balances the federal budget in the next 10 years. (Applause.)\nAnd in this time of widening threats and new provocations, President Trump made it a priority in this budget. And we will with his support and with the strong support of your representatives in Washington -- we will rebuild our military. We will restore the arsenal of democracy, and we will give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission defending our nation and come home safe. (Applause.)\nIn this recent budget, President Donald Trump just proposed one of the largest increases in defense spending since the days of President Ronald Reagan. We're committed to making the strongest fighting force in world even stronger still.\nBut it's not just about our military. This President is also keeping his promise on domestic security. We're providing all new resources to strengthen our borders, enforce our laws. Even as we speak this administration, working with local law enforcement -- are taking gang members, drug dealers, and criminal illegal aliens off the streets of Louisiana and off the streets of America. (Applause.)\nAnd in the budget we just proposed, President Donald Trump is requesting the resources we'll need to build a wall. (Applause.)\n? Thanks to the President's leadership I'm pleased to report already -- illegal crossings at our southern border are already down more than 70 percent since January 1st of this year. (Applause.)\nAnd let me also say President Trump is also standing with renewed vigor for those who keep our families and our communities safe, the brave men and women who wear the uniform of law enforcement. (Applause.)\nI want to share with you that America watched with horror last year as three police officers were brutally gunned down and three more were grievously injured here in Baton Rouge. And I want to assure you President Donald Trump beginning with our law enforcement memorial last Monday is stepping forward, and we will restore the tradition of respect that is due to all the men and women of law enforcement in this nation. (Applause.)\nJust last week, at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service, where we mourned the fallen from Baton Rouge, President Trump declared clearly that America today and always stands strong with the men and women on the Thin Blue Line. There's an awful lot of members of law enforcement here today making this event possible and keeping us all safe. Would you join me in just giving a round of applause for the men and women serving in law enforcement at every level who are with us today? (Applause.)\nI know our President is going to fight every day to protect those who protect us, and we will make America safe again.\nPresident Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people, but he knows that security at the end of the day is the foundation for our quality of life and a foundation for the prosperity that the American people all aspire to. And President Trump I promise you is fighting every day to make America prosperous again and renew the prosperity of the American people in our time. (Applause.)\nYou know, literally since the outset of this administration, the President has had a three-part agenda: Jobs, jobs, and jobs. (Applause.)\nAnd I can tell you since day one, the President has been taking decisive action to put America back to work and get our economy moving again. He ordered every agency in Washington, D.C., for instance, to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any red tape on businesses large and small across America. (Applause.)\nThe President is slashing so much red tape he's been breaking records. He's eliminated rules and mandates that have cost the American economy as much as $18 billion every year.\nAnd the President is fighting every day for American energy, so important here in the great state of Louisiana. (Applause.)\nThe President knows that our energy -- oil and gas in particular -- are the lifeblood not only of Louisiana but of America. That's why he's been breaking down barriers standing in the way of offshore drilling, and President Trump approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines -- (applause) -- putting America on a path to energy independence.\nAnd the President's leadership is already making a remarkable difference in the American economy. Businesses are responding to the President's call to Buy American and Hire American.\nYou may not have read this in the newspaper, but the truth is more than 700,000 new American jobs have been created by businesses large and small just this year alone. (Applause.)\nBusiness after business has announced record investment in American workers -- billions of dollars, thousands of jobs, optimism is sweeping America. The American economy is roaring back under the leadership of President Trump. (Applause.)\nSmall businesses like those so well represented here haven't been this confident in a decade. Manufacturers haven't been this optimistic in more than 20 years. From coast to coast, the American people know that President Trump has turned America around.\nBut as Louisiana knows, one of the most important things we need to do to create jobs and restore boundless opportunity in America is to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nAnd I got good news for you: Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and to strong support in the Congress, the Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.)\nI just heard once again firsthand from Todd and all the small-business owners who gathered for a conversation earlier about the burden that Obamacare is placing on job creators like Cajun Industries and all of those that are with us today.\nEvery day, you see another grim reminder that Obamacare is a burden on the American people too. We all remember all the promises that were made to pass Obamacare, right? They said if you like your doctor you can keep them -- not true. They said if you like your health insurance you could keep it -- not true. We were told that health insurance costs would go down -- not true.\nThat's why President Trump is showing the numbers that the last administration never wanted the American people to see, I guess. According to a new study published just last night by the Department of Health and Human Services, it's now official, Obamacare, in the facts, has caused premiums to skyrocket across the America. Here are the numbers. This is fresh out from Health and Human Services yesterday. The average premium across this country has actually doubled under Obamacare -- more than 100 percent increase in only four years.\nHere in Louisiana, Obamacare premiums have spiked by nearly 125 percent. The average plan here in the Pelican State costs more than $3,500 more than it did just a few short years ago. I heard one story after another from the small-business owners that were just gathered here. These are the real numbers that have been released by our administration, and they're numbers that the past administration just never would release to the public.\nAnd the sad fact is, as Seema Verma just said, that politicians in Washington, D.C., who gave us this failed policy in 2010, are refusing to even lift a finger to bring relief to hurting families and American businesses.\nLouisiana knows the truth -- every day Obamacare survives is another day the American economy and American families struggle.\nBut let me make you a promise: Help is on the way, Louisiana. (Applause.)\nLast month, thanks to the leadership of our President and the support of Congressman Graves and every single Republican from Louisiana in the House of Representatives, Congress in the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act, which is the first step to keeping our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. And they should be commended. (Applause.)\nThe bill that passed the House is the right bill to start the fix of American health care. It holds back Obamacare's mandates on the American people by literally repealing the taxes and penalties at the heart of Obamacare. It gives working families more choices with expanded health savings accounts and a new tax credit to help buy the insurance at a price that you can afford.\nAnd to all the parents that are here today, just know that this bill also to keep your kids on your plans till they turn 26, and the bill also ensures -- and let's be clear on this -- at the President's insistence, the legislation that passed the House of Representatives ensures that Americans with preexisting conditions will have access to the coverage and care they need. No exceptions. (Applause.)\nBut the American Health Care Act also gives states like Louisiana the freedom and the flexibility they need with Medicaid to help your most vulnerable in the way that's best for you; because state-based solutions are the best way to give better coverage, better health care, and a better future for the people of the Pelican State. Let's let Louisiana develop Louisiana solutions for the people of this state. (Applause.)\nThe American Health Care Act starts the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare with a health-care system that will actually work. But we need Louisiana's help to get it across the finish line.\nI really am grateful to say again, every Republican in Louisiana's congressional delegation voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.) I hope you'll call -- I hope you'll leave here today and call your congressman a call and thank them, thank them for their leadership and their principled stand.\nBut I'd also suggest that you might call your two Republican senators and tell them it's time for the Senate to step up and do their part to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nWe're counting on Senator Cassidy and we're counting on Senator Kennedy to keep their promise to the American people and pass this legislation to bring Obamacare to an end. (Applause.)\nWith your senators' support, I know that in the months ahead we'll pass this legislation and begin the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare and finally giving the American people the kind of healthcare they deserve built on American principles of competition and state-based flexibility and reform. (Applause.)\nAnd once we repeal and replace Obamacare, we'll get to the rest of the President's agenda. In case Cajun Industries didn't notice, in case the rest of you didn't notice, you actually elected a builder to be President of the United States of America, and Donald Trump, your President, is going to rebuild the infrastructure of this country.\nPresident Trump is committed to make historic investments in American infrastructure to ensure that we have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, airports, and the best future we could possibly imagine.\nAnd the President is going to continue to slash through red tape, rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple Louisiana's economy from the comfort of those taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C.\nAnd get ready, come this summer, we're going to roll our sleeves up, we're going to work with the House and the Senate, and we're going to pass the most significant tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan and one of the largest tax cuts in American history. (Applause.)\nWith the President's leadership, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. Also we're going to reform the tax code. There's an old joke that the American tax code is 10 times the size of the Bible with none of the good news. (Laughter.) We're going to change that.\nRest assured, the President is going make the tax code simpler, flatter, and fairer for everyone. He's going to put more money in your pockets, keep it out of the hands of wasteful bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\nAnd this President also knows the time has come to make sure that businesses here in Louisiana, businesses across America have a competitive business tax rate to be able to create jobs and keep jobs here in America. And we're going to slash the business rate to 15 percent. (Applause.)\nBy lowering the corporate tax rate, which today is one of the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world -- by lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, we're going to make American businesses more competitive. We're going to make it more possible for businesses to reinvest in ways that will create jobs and also have an opportunity to increase wages for all the hardworking people at their companies today.\nIt's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is so committed to restoring an America of prosperity and freedom and security. And no matter what the media and the establishment in Washington, D.C. may be focused on at any given moment, let me assure of you this: President Trump and I will never stop fighting for the issues that matter most to the American people -- good jobs, safe streets, national security and a boundless American future. (Applause.)\nI think we've reached a pivotal moment in the life of this nation. I really do. And in this moment, President Trump and I need the support of every freedom-loving American -- all of you. (Applause.) Everyone who believes that we can be strong again, everyone who believes we can be prosperous again, we need you to stand up and we need you to speak out.\nFrom this day forward, I would offer to you that your President, our entire administration need every ounce of your energy and enthusiasm, the enthusiasm that I see in this crowd today. Your conviction and your passion. And we might need just one more thing in these days if you're of a mind to bend the knee and bow the head from time to time. (Applause.)\nBut in these challenging times of widening threats and provocations abroad, unknowable threats that can strike in an instant, as we saw this week in our ally England, in these times of a struggling economy, the most powerful economy on Earth that seems to have been unable to get back up, stand up, and lead the world, the truth is that now is the time when we could use your prayers.\nAnd I don't say so much for an agenda. I think often of what Abraham Lincoln said in his time. He was asked if he thought that God was on the Union's side. And Lincoln said, I rather concern myself more with whether we're on God's side than whether God is on our side. (Applause.)\nSo just pray for America. Pray for our country. The leadership that the people of this world are seeing as the President travels across the Middle East and now in Europe is so essential. We are in every sense a beacon of hope and freedom. And so when America is strong, when America is secure, the world is safer. The world is more prosperous. And freedom-loving people around the world are better for it.\nSo I encourage you to remember us in those quiet times. And when you pray, pray with confidence. Because I truly do believe those ancient words spoken so long ago are as true today as they were then that, if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this great nation, he'll hear from Heaven and he'll heal our land. (Applause.) This one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\n? So thank you all for being here today. I've got to get back to Washington, D.C. because time is a wasting. (Laughter.) But thank you for being here. Thanks for letting your voice be heard. And I want to make you a promise. With your help, with your support, with the strong support of our great Republican leadership in the House and in the Senate, and with God's help, we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again.\nThank you all very much. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

It is a moment of collective reflection on the noble sacrifices of those who gave the last measure of devotion in service of our ideals and in the defense of our Nation. On this ceremonious day, we remember the fallen, we pray for a lasting peace among nations, and we honor these guardians of our inalienable rights.\nThis year, we commemorate the centennial anniversary of America's entry into World War I. More than 4.7 million Americans served during The Great War, representing more than 25 percent of the American male population between the ages of 18 and 31 at the time. We remember the more than 100,000 Americans who sacrificed their lives during \"The War to End All Wars,\" and who left behind countless family members and loved ones. We pause again to pray for the souls of those heroes who, one century ago, never returned home after helping to restore peace in Europe.\nOn Memorial Day we honor the final resting places of the more than one million men and women who sacrificed their lives for our Nation, by decorating their graves with the stars and stripes, as generations have done since 1868. We also proudly fly America's beautiful flag at our homes, businesses, and in our community parades to honor their memory. In doing so, we pledge our Nation's allegiance to the great cause of freedom for which they fought and ultimately died.\nIn honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 29, 2017, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.\nI further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.\nI also request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

This visit marked the President's first engagement with Belgian leadership.\nAt the Royal Palace, President Trump and the First Lady first met with the King and Queen and expressed their appreciation for the hospitality and their long personal support for better economic relations between Belgium and the United States. This year is the centennial year of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, which kept millions of Belgians from starving during World War I and currently supports Belgian educational exchanges with the United States.\nIn a subsequent meeting with Prime Minister Charles Michel, the President praised Belgian contributions to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, noting the critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria. On the eve of the NATO Leaders Meeting, the President discussed the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden, including the need for all NATO members to meet the Wales commitment to spend 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product on defense. The President expressed sympathy for Belgium's suffering at the hands of terrorists, and the two leaders explored how to improve their cooperation on counterterrorism. The President reaffirmed his desire for a productive economic and security relationship with Europe and promised to continue strengthening cooperation with Belgium on these and other important issues.", "timestamp": "2017-05-25", "title": "Press Release - Readout of President Donald J.

In his remarks, he referred to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; and Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. He also referred to the May 23 terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, United Kingdom.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125840", "text": "Thank you very much, Secretary General Stoltenberg. Chancellor Merkel, thank you very much. Other heads of state and government, I am honored to be here with members of an alliance that has promoted safety and peace across the world.\nPrime Minister May, all of the nations here today grieve with you and stand with you. I would like to ask that we now observe a moment of silence for the victims and families of the savage attack which took place in Manchester.\n[At this point, a moment of silence was observed.]\nThank you. Terrible thing.\nThis ceremony is a day for both remembrance and resolve. We remember and mourn those nearly 3,000 innocent people who were brutally murdered by terrorists on September 11th, 2001. Our NATO allies responded swiftly and decisively, invoking for the first time in its history the article 5 collective defense commitments.\nThe recent attack on Manchester in the United Kingdom demonstrates the depths of the evil we face with terrorism. Innocent little girls and so many others were horribly murdered and badly injured while attending a concert, beautiful lives with so much great potential torn from their families forever and ever. It was a barbaric and vicious attack upon our civilization.\nAll people who cherish life must unite in finding, exposing, and removing these killers and extremists and, yes, losers. They are losers. Wherever they exist in our societies, we must drive them out and never, ever let them back in.\nThis call for driving out terrorism is a message I took to a historic gathering of Arab and Muslim leaders across the region, hosted by Saudi Arabia. There, I spent much time with King Salman, a wise man who wants to see things get much better rapidly. The leaders of the Middle East have agreed at this unprecedented meeting to stop funding the radical ideology that leads to this horrible terrorism all over the globe.\nMy travels and meetings have given me renewed hope that nations of many faiths can unite to defeat terrorism, a common threat to all of humanity. Terrorism must be stopped in its tracks, or the horror you saw in Manchester and so many other places will continue forever. You have thousands and thousands of people pouring into our various countries and spreading throughout, and in many cases, we have no idea who they are. We must be tough, we must be strong, and we must be vigilant.\nThe NATO of the future must include a great focus on terrorism and immigration, as well as threats from Russia and on NATO's eastern and southern borders. These grave security concerns are the same reason that I have been very, very direct with Secretary Stoltenberg and members of the Alliance in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations, but 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years. Over the last 8 years, the United States spent more on defense than all other NATO countries combined. If all NATO members had spent just 2 percent of their GDP on defense last year, we would have had another $119 billion for our collective defense and for the financing of additional NATO reserves.\nWe should recognize that with these chronic underpayments and growing threats, even 2 percent of GDP is insufficient to close the gaps in modernizing, readiness, and the size of forces. We have to make up for the many years lost. Two percent is the bare minimum for confronting today's very real and very vicious threats. If NATO countries made their full and complete contributions, then NATO would be even stronger than it is today, especially from the threat of terrorism.\nI want to extend my appreciation to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York for contributing this remnant of the North Tower, as well as to Chancellor Merkel and the German people for donating this portion of the Berlin Wall. It is truly fitting that these two artifacts now reside here so close together at the new NATO Headquarters. And I never asked once what the new NATO Headquarters cost. I refuse to do that. But it is beautiful.\nEach one marks a pivotal event in the history of this alliance and in the eternal battle between good and evil. On one side, a testament to the triumph of our ideals over a totalitarian communist ideology bent on the oppression of millions and millions of people; on the other, a painful reminder of the barbaric evil that still exists in the world and that we must confront and defeat together as a group, as a world.\nThis twisted mass of metal reminds us not only of what we have lost, but also what forever endures: the courage of our people, the strength of our resolve, and the commitments that bind us together as one.\nWe will never forget the lives that were lost. We will never forsake the friends who stood by our side. And we will never waiver in our determination to defeat terrorism and to achieve lasting security, prosperity, and peace.\nThank you very much. It's a great honor to be here.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125844", "text": "This month, President Trump and his Administration took decisive action to fulfill the President's promise to keep our communities safe.\nJust yesterday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the arrests of nearly 200 individuals in Southern California. These arrests arise out of a five-day operation targeting at-large criminal aliens, illegal re-entrants, and immigration fugitives. Almost 90 percent of those arrested had prior criminal convictions—including convictions for domestic violence, battery, sex crimes, manslaughter, assault, arson, and cruelty to a child.\nLast week, ICE announced that in the 100 days since President Trump signed his Executive Orders on immigration enforcement, the agency has arrested roughly 30,000 convicted criminal aliens whose offenses range from homicide and assault, to sexual abuse and drug-related activity.\nICE noted that these arrests include:\n* The February 16th arrest in New York City of Salvadoran national, Estivan Rafael Marques Velasquez. An MS-13 gang member, Velasquez's criminal history in the United States includes reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n* The March 9th arrest in DeKalb, Georgia of Mexican citizen, Jose Mercedes Meza-Ignacio, who was wanted on criminal charges for child molestation.\n* The April 10th arrest in Dallas, Texas, of Juan Antonio Melchor Molina, who was the subject of a 2011 murder warrant issued in Mexico.\n* The April 13th arrest in Denver, Colorado, of one of ICE's \"Most Wanted Fugitives,\" Honduran citizen, Jose Victor Bonilla-Melendez. Bonilla-Melendez's criminal history includes felony convictions for assault causing serious bodily injury, sexual assault, and unlawful re-entry after deportation.\n* The April 26th arrest in Houston, Texas, of a Salvadoran MS-13 gang member, William Magana-Contreras, who was wanted for aggravated homicide in his home country.\nAdditionally, earlier this month, ICE detailed the results of its six-week nationwide gang apprehension operation, which resulted in the arrest of 384 illegal immigrants, as well as 61 foreign nationals voluntarily admitted into the country. The arrests of these 445 foreign nationals include those arrested for homicide- or sexual crime-related charges. These arrests included:\n* The March 27th arrest – carried out by local Phoenix officials – of a Banda Los Dioes gang member, who was wanted for murder in Honduras. This gang member is a citizen of Honduras and was unlawfully present in the United States.\n* The March 29th arrest – carried out by local Baltimore officials and Montgomery County Police – of a MS-13 member based upon a murder warrant.\n* The April 5th arrest – carried out by local Kansas City officials and the Kansas City Police Department – of a MS-13 gang member. At the time of processing, the MS-13 member was a suspect for a prior homicide in Kansas City, Missouri.\n* The April 18th arrest – carried out by local Los Angeles officials assisted the Los Angeles County California Sheriff's Department – of a Barrio 13 gang member for murder. The gang member had previously been deported from the United States.\n* The April 20th arrest – carried out by local Baltimore officials and the Prince George County, Maryland Police Department – of an MS-13 associate for attempted murder. The MS-13 associate was unlawfully present in the United States.\n* The May 2nd arrest – carried out by local Long Island officials and the Nassau County, New York Police Department – of three MS-13 members for attempted murder, in violation of New York state law. The three MS-13 members are citizens of El Salvador and two were unlawfully present in the United States with the third MS-13 member pending immigration benefits.\n* The April 20th arrest – carried out by local Newark officials – of an MS-13 member, who was extradited from Guatemala and charged with murder\nAdditional Information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement:\nEarlier this month, a Guatemalan man illegally residing in the country was sentenced to 50 years in federal prison for two counts of producing child pornography. According to court documents, Edwin Velasquez-Curuchiche, 40, befriended a Tennessee family that lived near him. ICE notes that:\n[O]n September 23, 2015, Curuchiche snuck into the family's home during the night and recorded himself sexually molesting the 6-year-old girl while she slept. Again, on October 1, 2015, Curuchiche snuck into the home and recorded additional videos of him sexually molesting the child as she slept. In late October 2015, the 6-year-old child awoke during the night and went to her parent's bedroom crying that someone had been touching her while she slept. One of her parents checked her bedroom and finding nothing, they assumed the child was imagining things. On the evening of October 29, 2015, the family returned to their home after a trip to the store. After entering the home, the daughter went to her bedroom to get a toy. Curuchiche was hiding under the bed and tried to grab her by the arm and quiet her by telling her to play a game on a cell phone, which he had previously given to her. The girl ran to her parents and the father found Curuchiche hiding in his daughter's bedroom closet, where he held him until police arrived and took him into custody. Court documents also show Curuchiche was apprehended in June 2013 when he unlawfully entered the United States. He subsequently failed to appear for an immigration hearing and was living in the U.S. unlawfully when he committed this offense.To read the full release, visit ICE.gov.", "timestamp": "2017-05-26", "title": "Press Release - Trump Administration Keeps its Promise: Begins Removing Violent Gang Members, Criminals, and Predators from American Communities"}

It is an honor to be with you all. (Applause.)\nToday, it's my great privilege to bring you congratulations and also to offer you the congratulations of your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nI must tell you, standing before all of you extraordinary young Americans is deeply humbling for me. It's humbling for me to be here, in the midst of Fleet Week, at this storied military and academic institution, with the extraordinary men and women of the Class of 2017.\nYours is already a class of distinction. You already distinguished yourselves the day you made the decision to put on the uniform of the United States of America and follow the path of service to this great country, and we honor you for it. (Applause.)\nThe 1,053 men and women before me, you are America's very best. In a few moments, 760 of you will be commissioned as Naval officers in surface warfare, Navy SEALs, aviators, and also in the Silent Service, beneath the waves across the world.\nAnother 260 of you will leave this place to continue your training as officers in the Marine Corps. And I understand that two of you will leave here as officers in the Air Force. (Applause.) Apparently well represented here. (Laughter.)\nNo matter what path you take, know that your Commander-in-Chief is proud of you, and so am I, and every American is grateful for you standing tall and stepping forward to serve our nation and protect our people. (Applause.)\nBefore I go, though, any further, I'd like to add my voice to those who have remembered three who also stepped forward. They did not leave here into service, they left here into Eternity. But we remember them today as much and honor them as much as all of you, for they stepped forward to serve this country. William McKamey, Justin Zemser, Jason Jablonski were men of honor who stepped forward to serve in the Navy with distinction. And I know the Class of 2017 and America will never forget them, and their families are on our hearts this day. (Applause.)\nToday is a day of pride and celebration -- not only for all of you in uniform before me, but for those who saw you through, for your friends, your professors, your commanding officers, and especially your families.\nAnd speaking of which, I'm grateful to be joined today by my commanding officer. Would you mind welcoming the Second Lady of the United States of America who is a Marine Corps mom? Karen Pence is with us today. (Applause.)\nAs the proud parents of a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps, my wife and I know firsthand that the commissioning of an officer in the United States Armed Forces is a deeply moving moment for your loved ones, the people who believed in you, who believed long ago that you could make it here, who believed even on somedays when you didn't that you would make it to this day. They supported you. They encouraged you. They prayed you through.\nSo before we go one step further, Class of 2017, why don't you break protocol a little bit? Why don't you stand up, turn around, catch the eye of one of your loved ones in the stands and show them just how thankful you are for all the years of love and support that brought you to this day? (Applause.)\nOh, and before I forget, to all the Midshipmen who here today, the whole cellphone thing and that last deal, your minor conduct offenses are completely forgiven. (Applause.)\nToday marks the end of four years of training at the United States Naval Academy, and the commencement of a voyage that will take you into uncharted waters. But make no mistake and have no doubt: You are ready to lead. The training and education you received here has prepared you well to face the challenges that lie ahead, because today you graduate from an incomparable institution.\nIt's remarkable to think that for more than 170 years, children of liberty have come to the United States Naval Academy to pursue a life of service and sacrifice.\nIn these halls, on these fields, and by this bay, midshipmen have been molded \"morally, mentally, and physically,\" and \"imbued with the highest ideals of duty, honor, and loyalty.\"\nThey, like you, departed this place and distinguished themselves -- in every era -- as officers in the United States Navy and in the United States Marine Corps.\nToday, when the boards and bars are placed on your shoulders, you will become the next link in a chain that stretches back, unbroken, into the mists of American history.\nThe links before you were forged by heroes -- from John Paul Jones, Stephen Decatur, Bull Halsey, Jim Stockdale, and Michael Murphy.\nBecause of them, and through the bravery of all who have called themselves Marines and sailors in our nation's history, America's freedom endures to very this day, and we honor all who have gone before you. (Applause.)\nBut now it's your turn to assume the watch. But remember it's not just America that your predecessors protected. Think today of what the world owes the United States Navy and Marine Corps.\nHere at the Navy-Marine Corps Stadium, these stands are emblazoned top to bottom with the names of lands and seas that were consecrated by the sacrifice of the American sailor and Marine.\nI see Belleau Wood, where the Marines charged the enemy six times, won the day, to defend the freedom of Western Europe.\nI see the Battle of the Atlantic and the many battles of the Pacific -- the Coral Sea, Midway, Leyte Gulf -- when the Navy rolled back the tide of tyranny that had engulfed so much of the Asian Pacific.\nI see Inchon in Korea, and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. I see Iraq and Afghanistan, where to this very day at this very hour, your brothers and sisters in arms stand strong and courageous in defense of liberty in the global war on terror.\nAnd between the places engraved on these stands, I see all that the Navy and Marine Corps have done, and continue to do, day-in and day-out, to foster peace and prosperity on the seven seas, to defend the defenseless in distant lands, to keep the shores of America safe from all who would dare threaten us.\nThe truth is that today you'll become leaders in the world's greatest force for good -- the Armed Forces of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAll of you who do so are patriots, heroes all. You're the pride of your family and you're the pride of the American people. There's not an American across this country who wouldn't like to have the view that I have today. It's very inspiring.\nYou're from the rest of us, but you're the best of us.\nAnd you'll leave this place and enter a world in desperate need of the \"honor, courage, and commitment\" that defines the leadership that you learned here.\nSo a few words of admonition. Trust your training and the principles you learned here, and you'll have success in your career and for your country.\nRemember that character is destiny. Be men and women of integrity. People follow people they trust.\nI truly believe that among the most important qualities of leadership -- whether it's in the armed forces or any other endeavor -- are humility, orientation to authority, and self-control. And I encourage you to cultivate these qualities as leaders in increasing measure every day from this day forward.\nWith humility, consider others to be more important than yourselves. Be servant leaders. Approach every challenge as a learner and a listener first. In multiple counselors there is wisdom, and the best decisions by the best leaders come from counsel and collaboration.\nNext is orientation to authority. Nothing I have to explain to those of you sitting before me today. Follow the chain of command without exception. Submit yourselves, as the saying goes, to the authorities that have been placed above you. Trust your superiors, trust your orders, and you'll serve and lead well.\nAnd lastly, as arduous as it has been, the physical training in this place, I encourage you to continue, to practice the discipline of self-control.\nThere's an old proverb that says: \"Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control.\"\nAnd I truly believe that commanding others first begins with being able to command yourself. Discipline is the foundation of leadership.\nIntegrity, humility, orientation to authority, and self-control are my admonition to you today.\nI truly believe that as you pursue these qualities of character, you will lead with distinction. And as you've done to this moment in your life, you'll prove yourselves worthy of the trust that your Commander-in-Chief is placing in you today, to be faithful defenders of our nation and our way of life.\nAnd as you prepare to assume your duties, I want to say to the new officers and to your families, President Donald Trump is the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States will ever have. (Applause.)\nAnd I'll make you a promise, no matter where you're called to serve, no matter what the mission, this Commander-in-Chief will always have your back. (Applause.)\nAnd to the families who are gathered here today and all these rising officers, I say President Donald Trump and I will not rest, we will not relent until we rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and ensure that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard have all the resources that you need to accomplish your mission and come home safe. That is our pledge to each of you. (Applause.)\nEarlier this month, President Trump signed a $21 billion increase in funding for our armed forces, the largest investment in military readiness in nearly a decade. And earlier this week in his very first budget, your Commander-in-Chief laid out one of the largest increases in defense spending since the days of President Ronald Reagan. Let me be clear: The era of budget cuts of the Armed Forces of the United States is over. (Applause.)\nThe President's budget increases funding for our national defense by $54 billion, provides more than 56,000 new servicemembers, and begins to rebuild our Navy with eight new battle-force ships headed for the sea. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump is working with the Congress to make the strongest fighting force in history stronger still. And with renewed American strength, your Commander-in-Chief is once again reaffirming America's role as leader of the free world.\nWhile we must always work, and hope, and pray for peace, the best way to ensure peace is for our adversaries and our enemies to know that America is prepared to lead and fight and win any contest, any struggle anywhere on behalf of freedom. (Applause.)\nNow you, the Class of 2017, will be the instruments of American policy. Today you leave the Brigade of Midshipmen to join the vanguard of freedom. Your mission is more important now than ever. And the mission of the United States Navy is multi-faceted. You prevent the outbreak of major war and uphold peace and security around the globe. It's part of what the Navy does.\nYou keep open pathways of prosperity -- from the Straits of Hormuz to the South China Sea, where just yesterday one of our mighty ships conducted freedom of navigation operations, reminding the world what American leadership looks like. That's also what the Navy does.\nAnd you do what the men and women of the Navy have always done, you bear the burdens of your duty with \"honor, courage and commitment,\" as the unbreakable backbone of American freedom.\nThat's what the Navy does, and that's now what all of you will do from this day forward. As soon-to-be commissioned officers in the United States Navy and the Marine Corps, all of you, from this day forward, are called to be leaders.\nAlways remember that you follow in the wake of heroes who have done just that. You can banish any doubt by thinking of those who have gone before, and the great cloud of witnesses that surrounds us today. Not just in the stands, but beyond.\nWhen I think of those who have gone before, I think of just a half-century ago, a young man from Trussville, Alabama, did just what you all did. He'd answered the call to put on the uniform and he was sitting right where you're sitting.\nHe graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1967. Not too long after that, he sailed across the Pacific to join the fight for freedom in the jungles of Vietnam.\nOne day, assigned to a small boat unit, he was working with his team to extract a group of Navy SEALs from behind enemy lines, when his boat was ambushed. He was thrown overboard, wounded by shrapnel. But he still found within himself the strength and courage to swim back to his nearly empty boat and provide cover fire for his brothers.\nDespite his own injuries, he personally attended to the wounded. He refused medical assistance until all his brothers-in-arms had been treated. He was awarded the Silver Star for his peerless bravery and leadership under fire.\nFifty years ago, he was sitting right where you're sitting today. He went on from that moment to serve with distinction -- 7th Fleet Commander, Fleet Forces Commander, and when he retired in 2003, he had risen to the rank of a four-star admiral.\nAnd that young man from that small town is with us today. Would you join me in welcoming Admiral Robert Natter, of the Class of 1967, who joins us here today? (Applause.)\nWe salute you, sir, and all the members of the Class of 1967 who are here.\nBut to the members of the Naval Academy Class of 2017, I say to all of you: What do you want to be thinking when you're sitting here 50 years from now?\nBecause we'll tell you it will come a lot quicker than you think. I know in my heart you want to be every bit as heroic and defined as leaders as those who have gone before, any one of the members of the Class of 1967 who are here.\nSo my challenge to all of you today is: Write your own story -- right now, in your mind. See it and go live it. Write a historic and heroic story of service and selflessness and leadership, and then make it happen.\nMany people wonder all their lives if they've made a difference. As the future leaders of the United States Navy and Marine Corps, you'll never have that problem. Your lives will make a world of difference and do a world of good.\nSo, members of the United States Naval Academy Class of 2017, this is your day. And as you prepare to leave this special place, I urge you to make the principles and precepts you have learned here the anchor of your life.\nCarry the example you saw in your peers, your professors, your commanding officers -- \"be worthy, never settle.\" Act, every day, \"not for self, but for country.\"\nI challenge you to uphold the highest standards of honor and duty of officers of the United States Navy and the Marine Corps, to be leaders in the mold of those who have gone before, like Admiral Natter and others -- in whose wake you follow.\nAnd above all else, I say to you: Have faith. Leave here today with the confidence that the American people are behind you. From your Commander-in-Chief on down, they support you and are proud of you.\nAnd also if you're of a mind, have faith that He who planted this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores and has seen her through every trial and has seen you through the challenges of the last four years will never leave you, never forsake you, and that no matter where your path may lead, He will always be there to calm the storm and guide you home.\nSo thank you for the honor to be with you today. Bravo Zulu to the Class of 2017. May God bless you with fair winds and following seas. God bless the Navy, the Marines, and God bless the United States of America.

This is who we are as Americans: We take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited.\nYet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices. As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people.\nThis has to change. We need a Government that spends on the right things—the safety, security, and well-being of our people—and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas, of which, perhaps, there are too many.\nMy administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American greatness. The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers.\nWe will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare. We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities. And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security. We will grow our economy; it is growing already. It will grow faster than you've seen it in decades.\nThat is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world. We are going to make sure the men and women on the frontlines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure.\nAt home, we are going to give our ICE officers—who have done an incredible job—and our Border Patrol agents—who are amazing people—everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all. It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams. We don't want MS-13 roving our streets; we're getting rid of them by the thousands. They're going to be out of here.\nBut I'm proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come.\nThank you very much.

During this month of fasting from dawn to dusk, many Muslims in America and around the world will find meaning and inspiration in acts of charity and meditation that strengthen our communities. At its core, the spirit of Ramadan strengthens awareness of our shared obligation to reject violence, to pursue peace, and to give to those in need who are suffering from poverty or conflict.\nThis year, the holiday begins as the world mourns the innocent victims of barbaric terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt, acts of depravity that are directly contrary to the spirit of Ramadan. Such acts only steel our resolve to defeat the terrorists and their perverted ideology.\nOn my recent visit to Saudi Arabia, I had the honor of meeting with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations. There, in the land of the two holiest sites in the Muslim world, we gathered to deliver together an emphatic message of partnership for the sake of peace, security, and prosperity for our countries and for the world.\nI reiterate my message delivered in Riyadh: America will always stand with our partners against terrorism and the ideology that fuels it. During this month of Ramadan, let us be resolved to spare no measure so that we may ensure that future generations will be free of this scourge and able to worship and commune in peace.\nI extend my best wishes to Muslims everywhere for a blessed month as you observe the Ramadan traditions of charity, fasting, and prayer.

The bloodletting of Christians must end, and all who aid their killers must be punished.\nAmerica stands with President Al Sisi and all the Egyptian people today, and always, as we fight to defeat this common enemy.

What a beautiful place! We had the greatest time here. And we did a lot of great stuff. And I want to thank you very much. This has been an incredible trip, and great strides have been made. My husband worked very hard on behalf of our country, and I'm very proud of him.\nThis trip has also been incredible for me as First Lady. In Saudi Arabia, I visited children at local school and a call center with all-female employees. In Israel, I spent time with some children at Haddasah Medical Center along with Mrs. Netanyahu. In Rome, I was honored and blessed to be granted audience with His Holiness, Pope Francis, followed by a very special visit to Bambino Gesù Children Hospital.\nJust hours after leaving, a young boy I spent time with found out he had received a new heart donor. Receiving that news is a moment I will never forget, and I wish him a speedy recovery.\nIn Brussels, I met with Queen Mathilde and participated in a forum on preventing the online exploitation of children, then paid a visit to the patients at Queen Fabiola's Children Hospital.\nThis trip, for me, has been very special and I will never forget the women and children I met. As one of the kids at the hospital that I visit said in a picture he drew for me: \"We are all the same.\"\nI also want to take a moment to thank you all for the sacrifices you make on behalf of our country. It is because of your selfless commitment that we enjoy the freedoms we have today. And to the families who endure time apart, or constant moves to the base, your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated. Thank you, and God bless you.\nAnd now it is my great honor to introduce my husband, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. I've got to get the lipstick off. Is it off? [Laughter] Thank you, honey. Thank you both. That's great.\nAnd I'm trying to figure out who's in that helicopter that is coming in. [Laughter] It may be Prime Minister Abe. It may be Justin from Canada. Great people. We made a lot of good friends this week, I'll tell you, a lot of good friends. They're good people.\nAmerica is very blessed with a lot of great diplomats—and I have to say this, as she just walks over here—but I don't think the United States could possibly have a better emissary than our magnificent and wonderful person, our First Lady, Melania. Thank you. Thank you, honey. The countries of the world have a large number of disagreements, but they all agree with me on that one, that I can tell you. [Laughter] So everywhere we go, it's the same old story. So great job.\nAnd you know, we've been gone for now a long time. Everywhere I go—but we have been gone for close to 9 days—this will be 9 days. And I think we hit a homerun no matter where we are. We're thrilled to be here right now. And we're getting on that very big plane; we're heading back to Washington and the United States. But to be with you at our great Naval Air Station is wonderful. I can think of no better way to conclude our first foreign trip than to spend the time with you right here, with the incredible men and women of the United States Navy, and with all of our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and our great civilians who support them, right? A very proud Nation salutes you. A very, very proud nation. And I'll tell you what, we are very, very proud of you.\nEvery single day, you protect the safety and security of the American people and provide a symbol of hope, freedom, and justice for the world. To our friends and allies, you are the ultimate reassurance; to our enemies, you are the ultimate deterrent.\nYou're the metal spine forged out of the fires of American strength. And you notice how much stronger we're getting? Have you—feeling it? Are you feeling it? All that new equipment just coming in. You saw what we did with our military budget, way up. Took a little heat on that one, but it's okay with me. [Laughter] You are the men and women who make up the most powerful military in the world, and under my administration—as you know, you've seen it, right—under my administration, stronger and stronger every single day.\nI want to thank Captain Brent Trickel for leading the American presence at the hub of the Med—you know what that is, right? The hub of the Med. Captain Trickle, considering everything your team has done to prepare for this visit—and you really have done a lot, I've seen it—feel free to sound liberty call as soon as wheels are up. Okay? That's sounds—maybe I'll stay down with you and celebrate together and just wave.\nBut before going any further, I also want to express, on behalf of the United States, our gratitude to our Italian and NATO allies here today. We have a lot of them. You're stationed at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, working side by side with Americans to confront the threats associated with the tremendous violence, suffering, and instability across North Africa and the Middle East. To every servicemember from Italy, from a NATO country, we want to thank you for your friendship and for partnering with us in the fight to defeat terrorism and protect civilization. [Applause] Better believe it.\nTerrorism is a threat—bad threat—to all of humanity—and together, we will overcome this threat. We will win.\nBut none of what we achieve would be possible without our wonderful military spouses and families. Each of you makes these great sacrifices for our country as well. Let's hear it for the military spouses, please. We will always support you, and we will never, ever forget you. That I can tell you.\nThere's one more very special group I have to thank, and that is our eighth-grade students right here in Sigonella. Where are they? Oh, here they are. I've been hearing a lot about you. In January, the eighth-grade class at Sigonella came all the way from to Washington to march in my Inaugural Parade. Right? Look at you. They're all so happy. Young. You're going to have a great life, right? Great life. Thank you very much. I have to say, are you all glad you did it?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Thank you, honey.\nIt's an image I will always remember: your smiling faces right out in front of the White House, carrying that great, big, beautiful American flag. Right? Thank you, kids. You traveled all the way from Italy to support my Inauguration, so today I'm glad to be here. And I traveled a long way to support you, and it's my honor. Thank you very much. Military children also make great sacrifices for their country, and I want you all to know that America is so proud of you.\nAs you know, I was here in Sicily to attend very important summit meetings, the meeting of the G-7. It was a tremendously productive meeting, where I strengthened America bonds—we have great bonds with other countries—and with some of our closest allies. We concluded a truly historic week for our country.\nOur travels took us to some of the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic religions, and to gatherings of both America's oldest and newest friends. We traveled the world to strengthen longstanding alliances, and to form a new partnership among nations devoted to the task of eradicating the terrorism that plagues our planet. And we've got the people that can do it, believe me. And I am now more hopeful than ever in the possibility that nations of many faiths and from many religions, and from many regions—all over, all over—can join together in a common cause.\nThe barbaric attack in Manchester—and the massacre of innocent young lives—underscores the depth of the evil we face, and the urgent need for us to join forces to absolutely and totally defeat it. I met with Prime Minister May and expressed the absolute solidarity of the American people.\nAnd just yesterday Coptic Christians in Egypt were viciously gunned down in another vile terrorist attack, one that took the lives of beautiful Egyptian children and others. These murderous attacks grieve our souls, but they also steel—and I mean \"steel,\" like in steel—our resolve. Together, civilized nations will crush the terrorists, block their funding, strip them of their territory, and drive them out of this Earth.\nMy first visit during my travels took me to Saudi Arabia, where I had the honor of participating in a historic summit with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab nations—hosted by King Salman, a wise leader who expressed his strong desire to work with the United States not only to confront terrorism, but also the extremist ideology behind terrorism.\nThe nations of the Middle East have endured one terrorist attack after another, and I called on them to take on the burden of fighting this evil that has killed so many innocent Muslims. During this unprecedented gathering, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists, and agreed to massive economic development deals, the likes of which there has never been, that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States, building the equipment that has just been ordered by Saudi Arabia.\nWe also further isolated the Iranian regime over its hostile and destabilizing actions and reaffirmed that Iran must never be allowed to obtain, under any circumstances, a nuclear weapon.\nI was deeply encouraged to hear from the leaders of many Muslim and Arab nations that they are ready to take on a greater role in combating terrorism and providing young Muslims in their region with a future of safety and a future of opportunity.\nNext, I went to Jerusalem, where I reaffirmed our unbreakable bond with the State of Israel. There, we continued our discussion about fighting terrorism and crushing the organizations and ideologies that drive it. I went to the Western Wall, a monument to the perseverance of the Jewish people. I also prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and walked those sacred halls. I was awed by the majesty and beauty of that Holy Land and the faith and reverence of the devoted people who live there. All children, from all faiths, deserve a future of hope and peace, a future that does honor to God.\nI visited Bethlehem, a city so precious to so many, and met with the Palestinian leader, President Abbas. He assured me he is willing to reach for peace with Israel in good faith—and I believe he will—and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who assured me that he, too, was ready to reach for peace. He's a friend of mine, and he means it.\nFrom Israel, we came to Italy. In Rome, I was inspired by the beauty of Saint Peter's Basilica and even more inspired by meeting with Pope Francis; we had a great talk. It was truly a honor to meet the Pope and to pray for peace on those hallowed grounds.\nThen, I traveled to two summits with our key allies, first at a NATO summit in Brussels, where we agreed to improve the burden sharing among members of our alliance and to further confront the shared threat of terrorism. Other member nations must pay more. The U.S. is currently paying much more than any other nation, and that is not fair to the United States or the United States taxpayer. So we're working on it, and I will tell you, a big difference over the last year. Money is actually starting to pour into NATO from countries that would not have been doing what they're doing now had I not been elected, I can tell you that. Money is starting to pour in. It's only fair to the United States. We want to be treated fairly. And we're behind NATO all the way, but we want to be treated fairly. All of us will be more safe and secure if everyone fulfills their obligations the way they're supposed to.\nRight? Look at this man. He's over there; he's agreeing with me a hundred percent. Most people agree with it.\nNext, I attended the G-7 right here in Sicily, and made great progress toward very, very vital goals. I laid out my vision for economic growth and fair trade in support of good-paying jobs, and even great-paying middle class jobs and more. And I called for much greater security and cooperation on matters of both terrorism, immigration, migration, to protect our citizens.\nFrom Saudi Arabia, to Israel, to NATO, to the G-7, we made extraordinary gains on this historic trip to advance the security and prosperity of the United States, our friends and our allies. And we paved the way for a new era of cooperation among the nations of the world to defeat the common enemy of terrorism and provide our children with a much more hopeful future. You're going to have a great, great future. You're going to have a safe future because of your parents and other people in this room.\nThat is why I knew I had to conclude my trip right here in Sigonella, with the dedicated servicemembers who make the future so bright. So proud, because I am so proud of the future you're going to have. Are you all proud of the future you're going to have? You'd better believe it, right? Dad, mom, we're all proud of it. We're all proud of it. We're proud of our country.\nThe men and women of the United States military have been the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world. I want you to know that you have a Commander in Chief who will never, ever forget. Never, ever. You will always be remembered number one. Just remember that. Always. I will give you my complete and unshakable support.\nWe have already made a historic investment in defense spending—you've been reading about it—because we believe—and you know this. What's the expression? Peace through strength. Peace through strength, right? You'll understand that when you get a little bit older. Peace through strength. And that's what we're going to have. We're going to have a lot of strength, but we're going to have a lot of peace. We will buy the planes, the ships, vehicles, and equipment you need to get your job done and to come home, safe and sound, back to your families.\nI also know that the single greatest strength of our Armed Forces is you—you, all of you—the dedicated, really tough and really disciplined service men and women who bravely fight in our name. You not only know the pain of sacrifice, but you also know the tremendous rewards of military service, of being part of something much larger than even yourselves. You know what it means to be part of a military team in which men and women are bound together in a sacred covenant of trust: to serve together, to sacrifice together, and to fight together. And by the way, and to win together, because you're going to win. You're going to do a lot of winning. You're going to do a lot of winning. And my pledge to you is that we will always protect those who protect us. You are protecting us, and we will always remember that and we will always, always protect you.\nAmericans fought and died to liberate Europe from the evils of nazism—you know that—and fascism. American military power helped to free the world from the oppression of communism. And today, Americans like you are battling the sinister forces of terrorism throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the world. American military history is rich with noble traditions, harrowing missions, and selfless heroes like your parents. But at its core, the moral of the story is always the same: It is the story of good overcoming evil.\nYou have poured out your hearts, your souls, and even your blood for this Nation, and we will pour out our gratitude to you in return. We will show our gratitude especially this Monday, on Memorial Day, when we pause to thank God for the heroes who have laid down their lives for our freedom. [Applause] Right?\nAmong those heroes was a young Navy sailor from Omaha. His name was John Joseph Parle. Parle enlisted in the Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor, completed midshipman training at Notre Dame, and soon ended up not far from here, in the waters of the Mediterranean. On the night of July 9, 1943, Parle was among the tens of thousands of Allied forces preparing for a surprise landing the next morning on the shores of Sicily, right here, about 70 miles away, to be exact. It was to be a major Allied offensive on European soil, and it was important.\nOn his ship, cloaked in darkness just 6 miles offshore, Parle noticed that a smokescreen device had caught fire in a small boat staged to support the landings. The boat was filled with explosives. He knew that if he didn't stop the fire, an explosion would light up the night sky, alert the enemy, all of his fellow comrades would be killed, and the invasion would be a failure. So Parle rushed to the source of smoke, hardly able to breathe, breathing the smoke in, and without a thought for his own safety, picked up the burning device with his bare hands, ran to the side of the boat, and hurled it into the sea as far as he could throw.\nIn that decisive moment, Parle didn't hesitate. He acted. And in that act, he helped ensure the success not only in the savings of his friends and those lives, but of the Allied landing itself, which turned out to be a very, very important victory. So the Allied forces went on to win the Sicily campaign. Critical in their ultimate victory was Parle. But before that final victory, the young, brave, beautiful sailor who helped to make it possible died from the smoke that had damaged his lungs so badly.\nEnsign Parle had just turned 23. Yesterday would have been his 97th birthday. For his brave actions, Ensign Parle was awarded the Medal of Honor. This Memorial Day, we remember him and all the brave men and women like him, who give their last breath in defense of our country. We honor their memory and their sacrifice. And we also hope to honor them with our deeds to prove worthy of their sacrifice.\nBecause there is no peace without those willing to bear the scars and wounds of war. There is no strength without those brave enough to protect the weak and people that need protection. And there is no prosperity at home without those willing to shoulder our burdens overseas. That glorious American flag represents the blood of patriots spilled in defense of freedom. It represents the courage that burns in American hearts. It represents the unity that binds us all together as one. And it represents the freedoms bestowed on us by almighty God.\nYou are the warriors of freedom. You are the protectors of that great American flag. You are the patriots who keep the fires of liberty burning. And you are the ones who protect the God-given freedoms that are the birthright of every single American child.\nI am proud to be with you today as your Commander in Chief. I am honored to have had this time to spend with you. I am excited for the great adventures and achievements that all of us will accomplish together. May God bless you. May God bless our servicemembers. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-05-27", "title": "Remarks to United States Troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy"}

Is to be as good as those we remember, particularly on this day.\nI think the work of Project Hero is a way that we honor all those who've served in a unique way. Since its founding in 2008, you've brought renewed attention to those heroes suffering from their time of service. Not all of the wounds from war are visible. And Project Hero's extraordinary efforts to create community around cycling has healed hearts and healed minds across this country. And we commend the organizers and commend the sponsors.\nIt is heartbreaking to think today that as many as one in five veterans has PTSD, and over 340,000 servicemembers received a traumatic brain injury. It makes all the more important the work of Project Hero and organizations like this that are coming alongside men and women who have served in the uniform of the United States, or in your case, in the uniform of law enforcement to give comfort and strength to those who are healing from those unseen wounds.\nProject Hero really proves that anything is possible for those that believe in one another and are willing to be there for one another.\nI also want to thank Secretary Shulkin for his extraordinary efforts in fighting tirelessly to finally give the veterans of the United States the healthcare they've earned and deserved in uniform. (Applause.)\nI'm pleased to report to you that just last month President Trump signed an executive order to ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs is effective and accountable. And the President also signed into law the Veterans Choice Improvement Act to ensure that our heroes have access to the choices they deserve and the world-class healthcare that you've earned.\nSo I hope all of you see today and the hospitality that we have extended as just one more token of the gratitude of all of the American people for the service that's represented here. We wish you Godspeed, safe travels, all the way to Virginia Beach. And for Project Hero and all of those that it helps, all the way to a full recovery in an America that cherishes all those who serve.\nThank you very much. God bless you. It's a great, great honor to be with you here and to welcome you here today.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. in the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery.

And thank you, General Dunford and Secretary Mattis, for your moving words and for your service to our great nation. Vice President Pence, Cabinet Secretaries, Members of Congress, members of the Armed Forces and veterans: Thank you for joining us as we honor the brave warriors who gave their lives for ours, spending their last moments on this Earth in defense of this country and of its people.\nWords cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage. We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service, but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones they left behind. Special, special people.\nI especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today. Incredible man. I always like to call him General. He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war. Not only did Secretary proudly serve in the military for more than 40 years, enduring many hardships, but he and his incredible wife Karen have borne the single most difficult hardship of them all: the loss of their son Robert in service to our country. Robert died fighting the enemies of all civilizations in Afghanistan.\nTo John, Karen, Heather, Kate, Andrea and the entire Kelly family, today 300 million American hearts are joined together with yours. We grieve with you. We honor you. And we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us. Thank you, John.\nThe Kelly family represents military families across the country who carry the burden of freedom on their shoulders. Secretary Kelly is joined today by his son-in-law Jake, a wounded warrior. And the Secretary's son Johnnie will soon leave on his fifth deployment. It is because of families like yours that all of our families can live in safety and live in peace.\nTo every Gold Star family who honors us with your presence, you lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers. They each had their own names, their own stories, their own beautiful dreams. But they were all angels sent to us by God, and they all share one title in common, and that is the title of hero. Real heroes. Though they were here only a brief time before God called them home, their legacy will endure forever.\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur once said that \"the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind.\" Here at this hallowed shrine, we honor the noblest among us: the men and women who paid the ultimate price for victory and for freedom. We pay tribute to those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil. They made their sacrifice not for fame or for money or even for glory, but for country.\nWe are privileged to be joined today by a man whose life demonstrates the values of service and sacrifice: Senator Bob Dole, here with his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole. Senator Dole fought bravely in World War II and was severely wounded by German fire. In just a few weeks, Bob will be celebrating his 94th birthday. And, Bob, I know I speak for millions of grateful Americans when I say thank you. Thank you, Bob. We thank you not only for your service, but for helping us to remember your fallen comrades and the countless American patriots who gave their lives in the Second World War.\nSince the first volley of gunfire in the Revolution, brave Americans in every generation have answered the call of duty and won victory for freedom in its hour of need. Today, a new generation of American patriots are fighting to win the battle against terrorism, risking their lives to protect our citizens from an enemy that uses the murder of innocents to wage war on humanity itself.\nWe are joined today by the wife of Specialist Christopher Horton, who rests on these so beautiful grounds. As Jane tells us, Chris \"was a man who loved his country with every part of his being.\" In 2008, Chris enlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard. He trained as a sniper, becoming known as one of the best shots anywhere at any time. He was a talented, tough guy. While Chris was in the National Guard, he was also a volunteer police officer. In everything he did, he was thinking about how he could serve God, serve his family and serve his country.\nIn 2011, he deployed for the first time to Afghanistan. Chris knew his job was one of the most dangerous there was, but he was determined to go after the enemy at any cost to himself. His missions helped target and kill terrorists who sought to destroy innocent people. Just 3 months into his first deployment, Chris was near the Pakistan border, trying to eliminate an enemy cell that was doing so much damage and that was planting deadly roadside bombs against his unit and the units of many others. Standing watch with his comrades, he died in the ensuing gun battle with enemy forces. Chris sacrificed his life to protect his fellow soldiers and to protect all Americans. He was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his courage. At only 26 years old, Chris secured his place in our hearts for eternity.\nJane, America, grieves with you. Our whole entire nation sends you our support, our strength, and our deep, deep love. You lost your husband, and America lost a hero. And together, we will preserve his memory: today, tomorrow, and always. Thank you, Jane. Thank you, Jane. Thank you, Jane. [Applause] Thank you, Jane.\nWe are also joined today by David and Rose Byers, the parents of Major Andrew Byers. As a boy, Andrew dreamed of the chance to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. He worked hard, he earned that chance, and he graduated at the top of his class. He became the commander of a special HALO team, leading his fellow soldiers out of aircraft, hurtling into dangerous and unknown territory.\nAbout this time last year, Andrew was sent on his third combat deployment. This time he went to Afghanistan. On November 3d, he was one of 10 special forces operators to land by helicopter near a Taliban safe haven in northern Afghanistan. They trekked through a mile of waist-deep mud and climbed a steep cliff before finally reaching the village that they wanted to reach. There, a night-long battle ensued. Andrew and his team fought off wave after wave after wave of enemy fighters. A grenade detonated, and as the Taliban began to surround the American and Afghan forces, Andrew ran through the smoke and through the hail of bullets to rescue an Afghan soldier. In the midst of this torrent of gunfire and danger, Andrew worked heroically to open a gateway and get his men to safety, risking his life to save theirs. And he did it. Unbelievably, he did it. But in saving those lives, Andrew was killed right then and there by enemy fire. Andrew has since been awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in battle. To his parents, David and Rose: We stand in awe of your son and his courageous sacrifice. On behalf of the American people, I express to you our everlasting gratitude for what your son did for his country, for his comrades, and for all of us.\nAndrew's father has said that he holds on to the promise of Joshua 1, verse 9: \"The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.\" Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. What a man he was.\nTo every Gold Star family: God is with you, and your loved ones are with Him. They died in wars so that we could live in peace. I believe that God has a special place in heaven for those who laid down their lives so that others may live free from fear and this horrible oppression.\nNow let us pledge to make the most of that freedom that they so gallantly and brilliantly fought for and they died to protect. Let us also pledge to tell the stories of Robert, Chris, Andrew, and all of America's fallen warriors today and for the next 1,000 years.\nAnd while we cannot know the extent of your pain, what we do know is that our gratitude to them and to you is boundless and undying. Boundless and undying. We'll always be there. Thank you. Their stories are now woven into the soul of our Nation, into the stars and stripes on our flag, and into the beating hearts of our great, great people.\nToday we also hold a special vigil for heroes whose story we cannot tell because their names are known to God alone: the unknown soldiers. We do not know where they came from, who they left behind, or what they hoped to be. But we do know what they did. They fought and they died in a great and noble act of loyalty and love to their families and to our country.\nIn a letter written that is now famous, one Civil War soldier captured it all and for all time. He wrote to his wife, \"If I do not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, nor that when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.\" That is the love we hear whispering throughout this sacred place and from every tombstone on these hallowed grounds. It is the love that binds this Earth beneath us and bleeds from the hearts of all of those who died so that we might live free.\nWe can never replace them. We can never repay them. But we can always remember. And today that is what we are doing: We remember. Words cannot wipe away the tears or bring back those smiling faces. But if Americans just take the time to look into your eyes and tell you how much we thank you and how dearly we pray for you and how truly we love you, then hopefully, you can find solace through your pain. And every time you see the Sun rise over this blessed land, please know your brave sons and daughters pushed away the night and delivered for us all that great and glorious dawn.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless our fallen heroes. God bless their families. God bless our military. And God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-05-29", "title": "Remarks at a Memorial Day Ceremony in Arlington, Virginia"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125850", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:11 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. I hope you all had the opportunity to pay your respects to the yesterday on Memorial Day.\nI want to begin by recapping the incredible, historic trip that the President and the First Lady have just concluded, because it truly was an extraordinary week for America and our people.\nIn just nine days, the President traveled across Europe and the Middle East and interacted with nearly 100 foreign leaders. It was an unprecedented first trip abroad, just four months into this administration, and it shows how quickly and decisively the President is acting to strengthen alliances, to form new partnerships, and to rebuild America's standing in the world.\nWe've never seen before at this point in a presidency such sweeping reassurance of American interest, and the inauguration of a foreign policy strategy designed to bring back the world from growing dangers and perpetual disasters brought on by years of failed leadership.\nPresident Trump started in Saudi Arabia, beginning his first foreign trip as President in the nation that's the custodian to the two holiest sites in the Islamic faith. The President was greeted on the tarmac by the King of Saudi Arabia and received with incredible graciousness by the Kingdom and its leaders throughout his stay.\nThe President's address to the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations was a historic turning point that people will be talking about for many years to come. He did exactly as he promised in his inaugural address, united the civilized world in the fight against terrorism and extremism. The President was very direct in calling on the leaders of the region to drive out the terrorists and the extremists from their midst, and to isolate the Iranian regime that supports so much of this violence.\nHe let American allies know exactly what they can expect from us going forward -- what he called \"a principled realism, rooted in common values and shared interests.\" He laid out the case in persuasive detail for why the Muslim world must take the lead in combatting radicalization. And he concluded by saying that if those nations go forward \"unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens our world, then there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have.\"\nThe President's historic speech was met with near universal praise. Former CIA Director Jim Woolsey called it \"a courageous speech.\" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in The Washington Post that we have to look back decades to \"find a comparably dramatic moment in the history of U.S. foreign policy.\" And former Democratic Representative Jane Harman said that she \"loved the idea that he's going to the fount of all three major religions.\"\nCountless Arab allies also praised the President's leadership on this visit. President Al-Sisi of Egypt said President Trump is \"a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible.\" The Saudi Foreign Minister said that \"this is the beginning of a turning point in the relationship between the United States and the Arab and Islamic world.\"\nKing Salman and other key allies also gave extraordinary praise -- extraordinary speeches at the summit, underscoring just how much President Trump has done to rally the world against terrorism.\nWe cannot overlook the significance of so many leaders of Muslim countries coming together to recognize the need to fight extremists. This was a historic event in that regard alone. King Salman said he shares the President's determination to \"renounce extremism and work on countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\" King Abdullah of Jordan agreed that \"the grave challenges of terrorism and extremism… demands coordination and global action at every level.\" He stated that \"We are all accountable for our commitment to fight radicalization in all of its forms.\"\nThe visit also included historic economic development deals for the United States, totaling well over half a trillion dollars and the creation of tens of thousands of American jobs. These deals included an immediate $110 billion investment, which will grow to $350 billion over the next 10 years in defense cooperation from Saudi Arabia that will further enable Muslim troops to take on a greater role in further fighting terrorism.\nThe President also participated in the launch of a new task force to block terror funding in the Gulf, the opening of a new Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology, and more than 30 commercial deals that include companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, GE, Dow, Honeywell, Emerson, Alcoa and Cisco, among others, that will result in an additional $270 billion of Saudi investment in American businesses and American jobs.\nThe President then went to Israel, where he was received with incredible warmth. He strengthened America's unbreakable bonds with Israel, made the first-ever visit by a sitting American President to the Western Wall, and gave a highly praised address at the Israel Museum as part of a continuing effort to rally nations together in the fight against terrorism and common enemies.\nThe moving address spoke of a future in which \"children around the world will be able to live without fear, to dream without limits, and to prosper without violence.\" He said, \"I ask this land of promise to join me and fight our common enemies, to pursue our shared values, and to protect the dignity of every child of God.\"\nThe President also visited Yad Vashem to memorialize the victims of the Holocaust and to pledge, Never Again.\nThe President Trump met with both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Abbas to advocate for a renewed push for peace -- which they both agreed they were prepared to work towards. He also discussed with both leaders how to increase cooperation against terrorism.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said \"for the first time in my life I see a real hope for change.\" And a correspondent in one of the leading Israel publications wrote that \"In the short space of three days, Trump carried out a semi-revolution.\"\nFrom Israel, the President traveled to Rome, where he met with Pope Francis at the Vatican. They had a very productive conversation about combatting ISIS and other terrorist groups, protecting religious liberty, and numerous other issues. The President and the First Lady were incredibly honored by the visit.\nThe President then attended the NATO Summit in Brussels, where he boldly stood up for American taxpayers and our common defense by calling on the other NATO countries to pay their fair share on a speech delivered with the leaders of NATO's -- of all of NATO's countries, all present. Hardworking Americans saw a leader representing them and their security on the international stage.\nThe President also urged NATO to adapt the Alliance to more effectively combat terrorism. Later in the meeting, the member states unanimously agreed on those two priorities, and the Secretary General was extremely complimentary of the President's work to dramatically strengthen the Alliance by getting member states to increase their contributions.\nFinally, the President traveled to the G7 Summit in Sicily, where he and other leaders discussed how to better promote prosperity and security for each of their countries. Those meetings were marked by outstanding success that we see reflected in the communiquй that was issued. They include a strong statement that G7 nations will stand against unfair trade practices, and a commitment to fostering a true level playing field.\nThe G7 leaders also endorsed the right of sovereign nations to control their borders, and endorsed in that communiquй the policy outlined by President Trump to seek resettlement of refugees as close as possible to their home countries so that they can be part of their eventual rebuilding. This language on migration and refugees was a major shift in policy toward the position of the President.\nThe G7 formally also condemned the use of chemical weapons. And needless to say, the President's leadership was critical in setting those priorities for action.\nIn addition, the President also met with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. The two agreed on the need for enhanced sanctions with respect to North Korea.\nThe President concluded his trip with an address to the service members and their family at Naval Air Station Sigonella, to thank them for their service on Memorial Day weekend and to deliver another strong message about the unity in the fight against terrorism.\nThen, yesterday, President Trump spoke at Arlington National Cemetery for Memorial Day services and visited the gravestones of many of our fallen heroes.\nThis was an extraordinarily successful and historic nine-day trip the President took. He accomplished the return of a strong America to international affairs, rallied civilized nations of the world against terrorism, took real steps towards peace in the Middle East, and renewed our alliances on the basis of both shared interest and shared burdens. The trip sets the stage for a much more safe and more prosperous nation here at home and a more peaceful world for all.\nWe're back at home now, and the President and his Cabinet are moving full-steam ahead on the President's agenda. As the President noted this weekend, his plan for the most significant tax reform in decades continues to progress, led by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and NEC Director Cohn. While the President was away, the team here held several meetings with members and leadership. In particular, Secretary Mnuchin met separately with the House Ways and Means Committee, Republican and Democrat members; the Freedom Caucus; and the Republican Study Committee.\nThe Vice President also discussed tax reform with multiple members and with leadership during his regular visits to Capitol Hill.\nWe'll begin holding industry listening sessions next week, providing an opportunity for business leaders and job creators to give us their inputs on what reforms are necessary to allow us to grow jobs and the economy.\nThis morning, the President met with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Pruitt. One of the topics that they discussed, of course, was the President's upcoming decision on the Paris Climate Accords. As I told you overseas, this is the subject that the President is spending a great deal of time on, and one that he spoke to the G7 members about during their meetings. Ultimately he wants a fair deal for the American people and he will have an announcement coming on that shortly.\nAlso today, the President's Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer is having several meetings with representatives from the Vietnamese government, including the Prime Minister and the Trade Minister, ahead of tomorrow's visit between the President and the Prime Minister. The U.S. Trade Representative will have readouts on those meetings available for you this afternoon.\nAmbassador Lighthizer will also be speaking at the Chamber of Commerce gala this evening for the Vietnamese Prime Minister. That speech should be available via the U.S. Chamber's Facebook page. During his speech, Ambassador Lighthizer will highlight the developments of our bilateral relationships with Vietnam over the past two decades while underscoring the work ahead in addressing the challenges presented by the recent sharp increase in our trade deficit with Vietnam.\nAs the President has made abundantly clear, trade deficits and unfair trade practices have disproportionately hit American workers. Through a robust and varied trade agenda, this administration is strengthening our important relationships with partners like Vietnam by leveling the playing field with American -- for American businesses throughout the world.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nPhil.\nQ: Yes, so the issue with the Russia probe, I'm wondering, Sean, if you can tell us when the President knew --whether the President knew at the time that Jared Kushner was seeking to establish back-channel communications at the Russian embassy through the Russian government. And if he didn't know at the time, when did he find out?\nMR. SPICER: I think that assumes a lot. And I would just say that Mr. Kushner's attorney has said that Mr. Kushner has volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings, and he will do the same if he's contacted in or -- and connected with any other inquiry.\nQ: Did the President discuss this, though?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what the President did or did not discuss. But what your question assumes is a lot of facts that are not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are, so far, being leaked out.\nQ: Does he approve of that action?\nMR. SPICER: You're asking if he approves of an action that is not a confirmed action. That being said, I think Secretary Kelly and General McMaster have both discussed that, in general terms, back channels are an appropriate part of diplomacy.\nQ: Does the White House dispute that that happened?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into -- but your question presupposes facts that have not been confirmed.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. But the President retweeted this morning an article about that back channel that was based on an anonymous source that said that there was an effort to set up a back channel, that it was the Russians who suggested that, and that it was to talk about Syria. Was the President not confirming that that effort -- that there was an effort in the facts that I just said when he retweeted that?\nMR. SPICER: I think what I just said speaks for itself.\nQ: But he was -- but you said that, first of all, that the article was based on anonymous sources --\nMR. SPICER: Which it is.\nQ: But the Fox article that the President retweeted was also based on anonymous sources. Why are those sources -- or the source, rather, that they used more credible than the one in The Washington Post article?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I don't think -- there's two issues at hand. One is the statement that Jared's attorney has provided. Second is whether or not -- the dossier that's largely the basis of this was largely discredited in the first place. Most of the publications here refused to even publish it in the first place. So, again, I'm not going to get into confirming stuff. There's an ongoing investigation.\nJohn.\nQ: Which John?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry -- Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions. First, the President, for the second time in a month, retweeted his desire for the Senate to reduce the votes to pass anything to 51, which would effectively scuttle the filibuster for legislation as it has been scuttled for nominations. Is this something he discussed with Majority Leader McConnell or any of the Senate leadership before he tweeted it?\nMR. SPICER: I think the concerns that he's had with the pace of the Senate has been longstanding. Obviously the use of the filibuster and the rules of the Senate are ultimately up to Senator McConnell. But I think that the frustration that he's had with the pace of some of the legislation and some of the obstructionist tactics that Democrats have employed, whether it's Cabinet nominees or other pieces of legislation, has been well documented.\nQ: But he wants to scrap the filibuster entirely --\nMR. SPICER: I think he wants to see action done, John. That's what the President wants. Whether it's the delays that Democrats posed to his Cabinet nominees, or pieces of legislation, he wants action. This President was elected to get things done. He wants to see things move through the House and the Senate, especially when you've got a majority of support, and people to stop playing games.\nQ: And my second question, I did want to mention that before he left to go abroad, the President praised Philippine President Duterte for his action against drug dealers and dealing with them. Various human rights groups have condemned President Duterte, saying that a lot of the executions of drug dealers have been done without trial. Does the President stand by his words of praise for the Philippine President?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President recognizes the need to combat drugs, but he also believes in human rights. It's something that he's worked with several countries -- it's one of the reasons that he's reviewing the Cuba policy, et cetera. He wants -- human rights is something that's very strong to him. It's something that he's discussed in private with several countries.\nZeke.\nQ: Tomorrow is the deadline for the Jerusalem embassy act -- the last Obama waiver, six-month waiver. Has the President made a decision about whether or not he will sign another waiver?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: And so that decision will be made in the next 24 hours?\nMR. SPICER: When the President has a decision to make we'll let you know.\nQ: And, secondly, we're also waiting on a few other reviews -- the ISIS review, as well as the Afghanistan review. What is the status of those? You mentioned that Paris -- we'll be hearing this week, the President said. What about the other two?\nMR. SPICER: I think, on the Afghanistan review, he's still reviewing that from the Department of Defense. When we have an announcement we'll let you know.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President tweeted on Sunday that he thinks Republicans should \"add more dollars to healthcare and make it the best anywhere.\" What did he mean by that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's a lot of savings that are coming out of the repeal and replace effort right now. I think we're at $119 billion that we saved through the President's efforts. And I think healthcare has been something that the President has been very clear on throughout his time as a candidate, through his presidency, to make sure that the American people get the care and the accessibility that they need. He understands how important healthcare is, and the bottom line is he's going to do whatever it takes to make sure that people have quality, accessible healthcare.\nQ: But \"add more dollars\" -- did he mean to the high-risk pools? Did he mean to the cost-sharing reduction payments? Where did he want to add them?\nMR. SPICER: I think this is -- the bill is in progress. Obviously it's in the Senate right now, and he's willing to work with them to do what it takes.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Following on one of Zeke's questions, Afghanistan is now the country's longest war. How much more American blood and treasure is the President willing to expend? And does he think it's a winnable conflict?\nMR. SPICER: I think the conflict that -- he wants to defeat ISIS. He wants to defeat al Qaeda. He wants to defeat threats -- to defeat terrorism. I think I just read to you -- throughout the trip, that was the common thread -- that uniting the Muslim world, talking about it with Prime Minister Netanyahu, talking about it even with the Pope, that wherever he went on this nine-day trip, protecting our country, protecting the world's people was at the front of that discussion. And I think he wants to do whatever he has to do to make sure that our country is safe and our people are safe. That's why he's asked for this review.\nQ: Sean, let me ask you a couple, if you don't mind. First on tax reform. The President tweeted over the weekend that it was going \"very well.\" You just used the word \"progress.\" However, Republicans on the Hill still appear to be divided. The President tweeted today that maybe they should reverse the filibuster rule. So I'm wondering what the progress is and what is it that is going very well at this point in time.\nMR. SPICER: I think the reception that Secretary Mnuchin and others on the staff have gotten from leadership and members from the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance, et cetera, has been very welcoming, as well as in the business community. But I think, obviously, as I just mentioned to the previous question, part of the reason that he is frustrated with the Senate rules is because when there is a majority of support on key issues or key people, as the case was in the confirmation process, he think it's standing in the way of progress that the American people have asked for.\nQ: And let me ask you about the FBI director. Before the foreign trip, Joe Lieberman was the leading candidate identified by the President. Mr. Lieberman is out. Where does the FBI director search stand? John Pistole -- he is at the White House interviewing today. Is he the leading candidate at this point?\nMR. SPICER: The President will be meeting with two additional candidates this afternoon, both Chris Wray and John Pistole. When the President feels as though he's met with the right candidate, he'll let us know. But he'll meet with candidates today and continue to do so until he finds the right leader.\nQ: Are they the two finalists at this point, or two of --\nMR. SPICER: The President is the ultimate decision-maker. And when he makes a decision as to who he believes is best to lead the FBI, he will let us know.\nKatie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President tweeted that tax reform is going well, but you just said that he's actually very frustrated with the lack of progress in the Senate. So does the White House still stand by its August deadline for tax reform? And does the White House still believe that healthcare, tax reform, and infrastructure is going to get done this year?\nMR. SPICER: So just so we're clear, there's two separate issues, right? One is, I think the talks that Secretary Mnuchin and other members of the staff have had and the reception that they've gotten to the President's bold tax reform proposal is extremely welcoming. I think the President in general finds it frustrating the way some of the -- how the Senate operates. And again, I'm dating this back to the holdup that they had on some of these unbelievably well-qualified nominees. So we don't want to mix those two issues together.\nBut I think he feels very encouraged by the reception that he's gotten on tax reform. Secretary Mnuchin, who had made the comment about August, had talked about, while that was a goal, that we're going to continue to work as hard as we can to get it done. But we've got a pretty bold agenda. He's still pushing hard on healthcare. Infrastructure is a priority of his. So the President's legislative agenda is in full swing.\nQ: Sean, where do you see the state of the U.S.-German relationship right now? And how important is that relationship to the White House and the President and the American public?\nMR. SPICER: I think the relationship that the President has had with Merkel he would describe as fairly unbelievable. They get along very well. He has a lot of respect for her. They continue to grow the bond that they had during their talks in the G7.\nAnd he views not just Germany, but the rest of Europe, as an important American ally. During his conversations at NATO and at the G7, the President reaffirmed the need to deepen and improve our transatlantic relationship.\nQ: And how did he view her comments that she felt that Europe could no longer depend on the United States?\nMR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, that's not what she said. So since you're misquoting the Chancellor, let me read what she actually said. She said: The times when Europe could rely solely on others is somewhat in the past. And as I have witnessed over the past few days, Europe must take its fate into its own hands. This means working in friendship with the U.S., the UK, and neighborly relations with Russia and other partners.\nThat's great. That's what the President called for. He called for additional burden-sharing. The Secretary General of NATO said that the President's calls are what's moving them in the right direction. The President is getting results, and more countries are stepping up their burden-sharing. That is a good thing for them, it's a good thing for NATO, and it's a good thing for America.\nScott Thuman.\nMR. SPICER: Sean, has the President been meeting with lawyers specifically about defending himself in the special counsel investigation into Russia? And I'm sure you've probably seen the reports that Congressman Adam Schiff would like to see Jared Kushner before his committee, and possibly to go over his clearances.\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to dignify partisan accusations of anonymous sources and alleged -- unsubstantiated attacks. So I'm not even going to --\nQ: And about the President, whether or not he's had any meetings with --\nMR. SPICER: The President has a lot of meetings. If the President has a decision on anything, we'll be sure to let you know.\nBrian.\nQ: Sean, a couple things. First, welcome back, by the way. Thanks. Two quick questions. This weekend, while you all were gone, someone shot up the Lexington Herald-Leader, and of course we understand what happened in Montana with now-Congressman Gianforte -- I think it's a misdemeanor charge of assault. Will this administration take a stand against violence aimed at reporters?\nMR. SPICER: We'll take a stance against violence against any individual.\nQ: And so would you -- all right, second, let me follow that up with, would you support legislation -- you all have been the ones that have come out screaming against fake media -- would you support legislation that would support real reporting, such as this shield law? I've asked you before, such as --\nMR. SPICER: We have a Constitution, Brian, that supports the First Amendment, which allows all Americans -- anyone in this country, frankly -- the freedom of expression. We support that full --\nQ: The second question: When you say that you're going to try to defeat ISIS and al Qaeda, what are you doing to eliminate the abject poverty that is the breeding ground for the terrorists?\nMR. SPICER: As we mentioned before, his national security team is putting together a holistic solution to defeating ISIS. When that strategy is complete, we'll have something for you on it.\nQ: You said that a back channel is an appropriate part of diplomacy.\nMR. SPICER: I didn't say that. I said that Secretary Kelly and General McMaster have both commented on that.\nQ: Add more to that. How is it that it's appropriate for someone who's a private citizen, not sworn in as an official of the U.S. government, to conduct any kind of negotiation or diplomacy with a foreign official?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I would just refer you to both the comments that Secretary Kelly and General McMaster have said about how they can be an important tool in diplomacy.\nQ: But, at the time, there was no one who was close to the President who was working in an official government capacity. How is that appropriate?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that both of those individuals who are steeped in national security and foreign policy have said that that can be an effective tool, generally speaking, in diplomacy.\nShannon.\nQ: I know the President hasn't made a public decision on the Paris agreement, and I know you don't want to get out ahead of him, but on the more broad issue of climate change, can you say whether or not the President believes that human activity is contributing to the warming of the climate?\nMR. SPICER: Honestly, I haven't asked him.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. SPICER: I can get back to you.\nQ: And do you feel like that is a decision he's still trying to make?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I honestly haven't asked him that specific question, so I would feel --\nQ: And just real quick on healthcare, to follow up on question back there. So as part of the tweet about wanting to add more money to get better healthcare, would the President consider putting back some of the Obamacare taxes that were taken out of the health bill as it goes into the Senate? Would he be in support of keeping taxes in there to help pay for healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: Again, that negotiation is ongoing with the Senate and I don't want to presuppose what the President may or may not want to do.\nDeborah.\nQ: Let me finish, please -- thank you, Sean, for calling on me -- Angela Merkel's quote: \"We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands…\" How did the President react to that? And will this have any effect on what he decides to do with Paris?\nMR. SPICER: You know, I think he -- like I said a moment ago, the President believes that seeing Europe and other NATO countries increase their burden-sharing is a very positive thing for their own countries, for NATO as a whole, and for the United States -- to see these individuals heed the call that he has so eloquently put out over the last several -- well over a year.\nBut when you look at the comments that the Secretary General made, he recognizes that the President's rhetoric has had an extremely positive effect on the strengthening of NATO and other countries stepping up the percent of their own GDP that they're putting towards their common national defense. That benefits everybody. It benefits us, it benefits NATO, and it benefits themselves.\nQ: And will it affect his decision on Paris?\nMR. SPICER: What? I'm sorry.\nQ: Will it have any effect on his decision on Paris?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- obviously, that's -- what he ultimately decides is up to him.\nQ: Sean, does the departure of Michael Dubke signal some kind of broader reorganization in the West Wing? Obviously, we're hearing that more campaign aides, like Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie might be returning; that there's a \"war room\" he might be setting up to deal with the Russian investigations.\nMR. SPICER: I don't think so. I think the President is very pleased with his team, and he has a robust agenda, as I've just outlined, that he looks forward to working with Congress to get done to achieve results for the American people.\nQ: Is the White House considering changing how you communicate the President's message at all? I mean, be it him communicating directly more or different faces at the podium.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't think that there's anything that we haven't said before about how, you know, we've got to -- the President has an unbelievably qualified Cabinet, and we've utilized them a ton in the past. If we can continue to do that on key issues, we're going to do that.\nUltimately, the best messenger is the President himself. He's always proven that -- that he is the best messenger not just for what he wants to articulate, but that the American people resoundingly chose him as their President because he understands the frustrations and concerns and values of the American people, and he is probably the best person to communicate that.\nQ: But do you think that he is happy with the messaging that's been done thus far?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's very pleased with the work of his staff. I think that he is frustrated, like I am and like so many others, to see stories come out that are patently false, to see narratives that are wrong, to see \"fake news.\" When you see stories get perpetrated that are absolutely false, that are not based in fact, that is troubling. And he's rightly concerned.\nQ: Can you give an example of fake news, Sean? Could you give us an example?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, absolutely. I'll give you an example.\nQ: Please.\nMR. SPICER: Sure. Friday, the President was having a great discussion at the G7, and someone from the BBC -- and ultimately an incoming reporter from The New York Times -- retweeted that the President was being rude by disrespecting the Italian Prime Minister, when, in fact, you all, in every one of the meetings that we sit in, watch the President with that one earpiece that's been used by other Presidents. And yet, the President did a great job at NATO, building stronger bonds, building stronger bonds at the G7, increasing America's presence around the world.\nAnd that's the kind of thing that the BBC and, ultimately, a reporter who's now joining The New York Times push out and perpetuate with no apology. What -- you're shaking your head, Peter. I mean, it's true. You did it. No, I -- and I'm answering Jim's -- but I think --\nQ: Can't reporters make mistakes?\nMR. SPICER: No, no. But that's not -- but that's just fake. That is a fake --\nQ: Sean, none of that was in the newspaper. None of that was on the front page. Your trip was all over the front page. You're making something out of one tweet instead of the vast majority of the coverage.\nMR. SPICER: But, again, you guys defend your mistakes like that.\nQ: Don't you?\nMR. SPICER: With all due respect, I was asked to give an\nexample, and I did it.\nQ: You gave it more prominence than anybody did originally.\nMR. SPICER: I gave an answer to Jim. The problem is, is that I think the President -- to the question -- gets frustrated when he sees fake stories get published, things that aren't based in fact, and a narrative gets pushed that --\nQ: That's something insignificant, though. That's just so minor.\nMR. SPICER: So that's just -- well, with all due respect, I think when you see instances like that get perpetrated over and over again, that is frustrating.\nQ: It's frustrating when you --\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not here -- I didn't come here with a list of things. But I think that there is --\nQ: Something big.\nMR. SPICER: Well, thank you, I appreciate it -- you get to decide what's big and what's not. I think there is a lot of this stuff that has gotten pushed out based on unnamed, unaccountable sources that is very troubling. And I think when you see the same kind of thing happen over and over again, it is concerning. And I think the President has fought very hard to bring back jobs. As I mentioned, you had over half a trillion dollars of investment that's coming in that's going to grow jobs, grow our economy. That should be a big story. The President's results when it came to fighting terrorism was a big thing. The idea that we're standing up a global center to fight extremism in Saudi Arabia that's uniting Muslims countries -- that's a big deal. I think --\nQ: Are you saying that reports that there's going to be an overhaul of the communications operation are fake news? That's the question --\nMR. SPICER: I know. So now you want to come back to that. What I'm telling you is, is that the reason that the President is frustrated is because there's a perpetuation of false narratives, a use of unnamed sources over and over again about things that are happening that don't ultimately happen, and I think that is troubling.\nThank you guys very much.\nQ: Sean, we reported on the counterterrorism center.\nQ: Come on --\nQ: Is Kushner fake news?\nEND 2:41 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-30", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125862", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:31 A.M. EDT\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: ** everybody. So a few weeks ago, the President came over to my offices at VA at his 100-day mark to talk about the recognition of the progress we've had at VA. So I thought it only fitting at my 100 days to come to his house to talk about what's happening at VA.\nAnd as you know, the President is so committed to fixing issues for veterans that what he has told me is, is that it is important that we be open and candid and transparent about where the problems are; that as a businessman, the only way to fix the issues in an organization is if you come out and you talk about what those problems are. And so, as you know, I'm a doctor and I like to diagnose things, assess them and treat them. And so what you're going to hear today is really a candid assessment of where our problems are in VA, with the focus of a businessman and the skills of a doctor to be able to actually help you with that.\nAnd as you know, many of these challenges I'm going to talk about today have been decades in building and they've spanned multiple administrations. And this is the time for us to really address these chronic problems that have affected veterans and, in many ways, have harmed veterans and their families by not dealing with these issues. So I'm going to tackle these issues heads-on.\nJust to give you a sense about what we're doing today, I'm going to talk about 13 areas of significant risk for VA. It's going to take about 25 minutes to get through, so if you need to get up and stretch, or if you have ADD and you need to leave, I will not be offended. But I just want to give you a sense about that.\nWe've had 137 different assessments and studies telling VA what's wrong and how to fix it. And what we've done in my first 100 days is to go through these studies -- the Commission on Care, Independent Assessment, as well as our own internal assessments -- to come up with these 13 areas of risk that I want to share. So let me start with them.\nThe very first area is access. And of course, as you know, we started with our wait time issue in 2014 -- the real crisis that began recently at VA. So here's my assessment on access. We've done a significant job in improving access to care for clinically urgent veterans, so people with clinically urgent needs are now being addressed in a much more efficient way. We've developed same-day services in every one of our 168 medical centers for primary care and mental health. And in fact, today, over 22 percent of veterans are seen on a same-day basis.\nWhat we've done recently is we've posted our wait times for every single one of our medical centers across the country in a public forum for everybody to see what's good and what's not good in terms of wait times. There is no other health system in the country that has done anything like that, and there is no comparison to what the VA is doing in terms of transparency and wait times. Yet veterans are waiting 60 days or more for new appointments in primary care and mental health at 30 of our locations nationwide. So we still have more to do.\nAnd while, as I mentioned, we've done well with meeting the urgent needs of veterans, 10 percent of the time when a provider wants a follow-up appointment in a specific time frame, we're not meeting that provider's clinically assessed time for a veteran to come back. And that's something we have to address.\nSixteen percent of our primary care clinics are over 100-percent capacity. When that happens we can't fully meet their needs in terms of access to care. Ten percent of our out-patient centers do not offer same-day services today. Now, we are committing by the end of this year that all of our out-patient centers will offer same-day services in primary care mental health. But today 10 percent are not meeting that.\nThe second category is paying providers when veterans go out into the community. And as you know, our Choice Program, our community care program, has provided increased access for millions of veterans. And we have 500,000 community care providers -- doctors and others -- out in the community who participate in our network. But providers are increasingly frustrated with the VA's ability to get them payments, to the point that some of them are actually leaving our network. And that's obviously working against us.\nIt takes more than 30 days to process 20 percent of our clean claims at VA, and that affects about 25,000 providers across the country. In addition, we have about $50 million in out-patient bill charges that are six months or older. As of April this year, only 65 percent of our claims are handled electronically. That's far below what you'd find in the private sector. And so we need private sector help in order to find new solutions to get that number well above 65 percent, so we can have faster adjudication of payments to our community providers.\nThe third area is community care in general. Though we made a lot of progress with our Choice Program -- because we've had over 70 amendments or modifications to our original contract -- we still have eight separate programs for paying community care. That just makes it too complex and it's confusing veterans and our employees alike.\nIn terms of the complexity of this program -- it results in VA rejecting one out of five community care claims -- the rules are so complex, people are so confused, 20 percent of our claims are rejected. And that's much higher that what you'd find in the private sector. And we need Congress to help us fix those eight separate programs and put them into a single program.\nIn terms of our Choice Program, we still, today, only have three Department of Defense facilities that participate in the Choice network. And we need to get the Department of Defense and VA to make all their facilities and our facilities open to veterans and to active service members.\nWe certainly have to work with Congress and our veteran service organizations to redesign this Choice Program. It will expire essentially at the end of the year, and we need new legislation -- this Congress -- to make sure that veterans don't go back to waiting longer than they need to wait to get care in the community. So we have to pass legislation this year.\nThe next area is quality -- quality of care in the VA. We've shared with you our star rating systems. We now publish that on our websites, and we also now publish quality of care comparisons between VAs and local community hospitals. And in that, we've identified 14 of our VAs that have one-star ratings. That means that their quality is below the standard in the community. And so that's not acceptable to us. We're deploying teams and implementing performance plans for each of those facilities.\nVeterans shouldn't have to accept low-quality care and they deserve our very best. I think everybody agrees with that. And when they're not getting the best that they can get in the VA, and the community offers better, that's what we're going to work to do in a revised Choice Plan, is to allow them to go out into the community if they're not getting the very best care.\nThe next area is disability claims and appeals. We have, currently, over 90,000 disability claims that are taking more than 125 days to process. Our goal is to cut that in half over the next two years. But 90,000-plus is too many to be acceptable.\nLast week, we processed a claim for disability in three days. That's called a due process, called a decision-ready claim. And we're going to be introducing decision-ready claims nationwide on September 1st of 2017. And in addition to that, we're going to be going paperless throughout all of our veterans' benefit offices by mid-2018.\nSo we are focused on not doing claims fast enough now, but we have plans to get much better. In addition, it's very hard for a veteran to get information on where their claim status is, and we need to make that process more transparent.\nIn appeals, it takes almost three years, if you were to file an appeal today, to get a decision. And it's going to take Congress to help us fix that system. I'm grateful that the House passed appeals legislation last week, and we need our friends in the Senate to act on appeals legislation as soon as possible.\nInformation technology. We have 20 of our facilities that have out-of-date systems for IT and inventory. And that makes it very, very difficult for doctors and nurses to get the supplies that they need to care for veterans. This is what we saw in the Washington, D.C. VA several weeks ago.\nWe've taken immediate steps to begin to start fixing these inventory systems, and we're executing on those plans. Currently, 75 percent of our IT budget is just maintenance and sustaining our infrastructure, because our legacy systems are old and are at risk of failing. And that would cripple our operations. Our scheduling systems and our financial systems are outdated, and that contributes to these excess wait times. Both systems are in the process of being replaced, but it's going to take years to complete that.\nWe have a system called VALERI, which is the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface. It's out of date. Without funding for a new system, VA is going to have to revert to a paper-based, manual system for electronic loans -- or for loans that are going to reduce the number of veterans that we serve, from 90,000 per year to only 12,000 per year. So we can't afford to let that happen, because veterans could be at risk of foreclosure or even homelessness, and that's a risk that we've identified.\nWe have to modernize all of our IT systems to make them commercially viable and cloud-based solutions to the maximum extent possible. And I've committed to making a decision on VA's electronic medical record in the very near future -- definitely before July of this year was my commitment -- that I will talk about how we are going to move forward with the new EMR strategy.\nCapital assets. Our buildings and our facilities are increasingly fallen into disrepair. We have a facility condition assessment report that identified $18 billion would be required to fully remediate our buildings now, including structural/seismic and electrical/mechanical improvements that need to be done.\nOn average, our buildings are more than 60 years old, with only half being built since 1920. We have 449 buildings from the Revolutionary War and the Civil War; of those, about 96 are vacant. We have another 591 buildings that were built in World War I era, which 141 are vacant. In all, VA has 400 vacant buildings and 735 under-utilized facilities, and that costs the taxpayers $25 million a year just to maintain vacant and under-utilized facilities.\nSo we need to be able to act quickly. VA currently has 27 facility leases that we're waiting for Congress to authorize. That would provide 2.3 million square feet of needed space for 3.2 million additional clinic visits a year that today we can't do because we need authorization from Congress.\nWe need different types of strategic partnerships to be able to bring the type of facilities that we need to veterans, and that means working with local government, with academic affiliates, other federal agencies, and private sector partnerships. We're going to work with Congress to develop a modernization plan for our capital infrastructure through what we call a National Realignment Strategy that's going to allow us to use our buildings in a better way, stop supporting vacant buildings and underutilized buildings, all to be a better steward of taxpayer dollars.\nConstruction. Eleven of our major construction projects, totaling $1.4 billion, are on hold because the VA and the U.S. Corps of Engineers still are trying to work through very difficult processes and interpretation of the appropriation rules. We're waiting for congressional approval on a joint proposal to move forward, which would allow these projects to go ahead.\nThe VA's major construction and minor construction programs have large, unobligated balances. We carry at VA $971 million in minor construction in unobligated balances, and $2.6 billion in major construction. VA is taking way too long to make construction awards, and these obligations are critical for us to meet facility demands in the future.\nAccountability. Under current VA law, VA has to wait at least a month to hold an employee accountable for misconduct or poor performance. We currently have 1,500 disciplinary actions that are pending, meaning people that either need to be fired, demoted, suspended without pay, for violating our core values -- and we're waiting for each of those actions.\nOur accountability processes are clearly broken. We have to wait more than a month to fire a psychiatrist who was caught on camera watching pornography using his iPad while seeing a veteran. The expedited senior executive removal authority that was given to us in the Choice Program isn't working. We weren't able to utilize that because of constitutionality issues. Because of the way the judges review these cases, they can force us to take terrible managers back who have been fired for poor performance. We recently saw that in one of our executives in San Juan.\nJust last week, we were forced to take back an employee after they were convicted no more than three times for DUI and had served a 60-day jail sentence. Under current law, it takes us 51 days from the date management proposes to suspend, demote, or remove an employee until the date that action takes effect.\nDespite the limitations of the existing law, we've recently removed the Washington, D.C. medical director from their position and other employees there as well due to their failure of leadership. We removed the medical center director in Shreveport, Louisiana, and three other senior executives for misconduct or poor performance. And the President signed an executive order that created an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection that reports directly to me as Secretary.\nBut that isn't enough. We need new accountability legislation and we need that now. The House, again, has passed this and we're looking forward to the Senate considering this. But we need that type of action.\nStaffing -- currently it takes, on average, 110 days to onboard a nurse in the VA, and 177 days to onboard a nurse practitioner. That's just too long. VA doesn't have a position management system, so it's very difficult for us to track what jobs are open. And an organization our size needs that in order to meet the needs of our veterans and have the right resources for them. We're going to establish a fully functioning management manpower office by December of this year, which is a first step in a position management system to be established.\nLow salaries for many of our healthcare providers and prosthetic professionals make it difficult to recruit and retain the best professionals. In 2016, the mean salary for a biomedical engineer in the country is $85,620. The national average for biomedical engineers in the VA is $65,677, or 25 percent below the private sector. For mechanical engineers, the difference between private sector and VA is $15,000 a year, or 18 percent, where VA is below the national average. If we can't compete with private sector salaries, we're going to be unable to retain qualified providers and support staff.\nTo help with these shortages, we're pursuing legislation that would expand graduate medical education training opportunities to be able to train more health professionals to stay in the VA system. And we're working with the unified services university -- the medical school of the military -- to train more medical students who then would serve in the VA for 10 years after their education.\nBureaucracy. Our central office in VA has grown too big and is too bureaucratic. We need faster, clearer decision-making and authority that's going to give veterans more control of their services and care. I've directed the VA Central Office to remain under a hiring freeze as we consolidate program offices. We have 140 program offices. I've directed them to implement shared services so that they don't replicate common corporate services. And that is a result that I plan to achieve of a 10 percent reduction in overhead.\nIn addition, we've been reducing burdensome regulations to make VA more effective. Effective immediately, VA will stop requiring the use of small-house design guides for future state home grants. In other words, we're going to stop using federal rules. We're going to allow the states to use their own requirements to build veterans homes in the future in the states. That's going to save taxpayer dollars while increasing access to veterans.\nA few weeks ago, we announced the VA is removing the more restrictive guidelines for a mammography for women and instead adopting the American Cancer Society mammography guidelines that will allow women veterans more access to care. We're restructuring our caregiver regulations to get services to veterans and make it less burdensome to get help from caregivers.\nOur vets.gov website is making it possible for veterans to get better access to our services. At this time last year, only 10 percent of benefits applications were done online. And because of our vets.gov website consolidating this, we now have eight times that number online a year later. Over 200,000 veterans have applied for health benefits using vets.gov.\nVA will be soft-launching the White House Veterans Complaint Hotline tomorrow, on June 1st. This is something the President had talked about. We're going to be testing that system, starting tomorrow, and fine-tuning it over the next several months, with the goal of it being fully operational by August 15th. The soft launch of this, which is being worked out tomorrow, will be active -- the phone number is (855)948-2311 -- and the full launch of that, as I said, will be August 15th.\nFraud, waste, and abuse. Detecting fraud, waste, and abuse -- it's very important we get resources to veterans and their families. We've been identifying preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. Already we've been able to prevent $27 million in fraudulent payments and duplicate payments in fiscal year 2016. However with centralized oversight, I know we can do much more than that. That's why I stood up the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Initiative.\nI recently announced a Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Prevention and Advisory Committee and we're creating that committee -- it's actually ahead of schedule. We're going to be naming co-chairs. I can name today one of those co-chairs -- Shantanu Agrawal, who is the president and CEO of the National Quality Foundation, with a heavy background in fraud, waste, and abuse. We'll be naming the second co-chair very soon.\nVeteran Suicides. And this is the last of the assessments. Though all of the risks that I've talked about are troubling to me and require immediate attention, nothing is more important to me than making sure that we don't lose any veterans to suicide. As you know, 20 veterans a day are dying by suicide. That should be unacceptable to all of us. This is a national public health crisis, and it requires solutions that not only VA will work on but all of government and other partnerships in the private sector, nonprofit organizations.\nI authorized emergency mental health services for those that were less than honorably discharged just a few months ago. That is a population of veterans that is at very high risk for suicide. And that's just the beginning. This summer, we're going to launch a new initiative called Getting to Zero to help us end veteran suicide. And again, that's my top clinical priority.\nSo, in closing, I just wanted to reaffirm the President's strong commitment to fixing VA and making VA work better for veterans. That's a commitment that I share. I wanted to come out and to talk about these 13 areas, our assessment of where the problems are. I want to be held accountable to fix this. I'm going to need help to fix it from Congress and from other organizations. But this is our commitment to finally address these problems that have been plaguing VA, sometimes for decades.\nThe President, the Vice President, Congress, veteran services organizations all share this goal to help modernize the VA. And that's why I'm confident that we can turn VA into the type of organization that veterans and families deserve, and all of us want to see. I appreciate your attention. Thank you very much.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you spoke of the situation in Puerto Rico, and there's a similar situation unfolding with the VA in Phoenix as well. Does this new legislation you talked about, does it get rid of this Merit Systems Protection Board? And will it eliminate the possibility that somebody like DeWayne Hamlin can get their job back at least temporarily?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: When we talk about the situation related to Mr. Hamlin, that decision was made before I was Secretary. I would not have supported a decision that would have allowed him back. The Merit System Protection Board indicated that they believed that we needed to take him back. I would have fought that through all of the appeals processes that were available to us.\nThe accountability bill that we are seeking, that we hope that the Senate authorizes, still maintains a due process for employees -- something I believe in. But it shortens the time and it gives more authority to the Secretary's decision on why these accountability actions are being taken so that the courts would be more deferential -- that's the legal term -- to the Secretary's opinion. I do believe that would have changed this situation.\nQ: Will you get anything in time to prevent a similar occurrence in Phoenix?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Not until we get this accountability bill through the Senate.\nQ: Is there anything you can do about that situation?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: You're talking about with the veteran benefit employees with Sharon Helman?\nQ: Yes.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: We are following the court cases on that. We're waiting for that final decision to come out.\nQ: Mr. Secretary --\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes.\nQ: Thank you. This is a robust agenda that you have laid out. Do you have a specific timeline? And how engaged has the President been in some of the discussions?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: The President has been extremely engaged. His commitment to being involved in veteran issues is one of his top domestic priorities. He has made himself fully available -- both he and the Vice President -- to anything that we need. The White House has been extremely responsive, and they are impatient and anxious for us to get on with this.\nSo each of these issues that I've talked about, these 13 issues, have different timelines associated with them because some require legislative action and some are more administrator requirements.\nThe President's budget this year, as you know, gave strong support to VA. And that will allow us to accomplish a great deal of what's on this list to modernize the system.\nQ: And as you know, the administration has been dealing with some controversies. Has that, in any way, impacted your agenda -- your ability to carry out some of these goals?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Absolutely it has not. We are completely focused on what it's going to take to fix the VA, and there has not been any lack of responsiveness from the White House on any of these issues.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, when we look at your list -- long list of priorities, do you have a sense of sort of top to bottom of these? What's the most cost-intensive and how much is it really going to take in terms of money over 10 years to get you down this road?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: The budget that was proposed by the President for fiscal '18 is a budget that will help us accomplish this task. I have said that the problems in VA are not largely going to be solved through additional money. These are going to be solved through management practices, focus, and some legislation changes.\nBut our issues are not because we're lacking the financial resources to be able to accomplish our mission. And so, therefore, I do believe, with the exception of one area, that we will not be coming back to Congress or the administration to ask them for additional money. And that one exception is to modernize our IT systems. I've said that I will make an announcement as soon as I can before July 1st. That is either going to look towards outsourcing our current system to a commercial vendor or picking a system that is a commercial, off-the-shelf system, and to get VA out of the software business. And that will require an initial capital investment that's not in fiscal year budget.\nQ: Is this the most expensive thing that you have to do?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes.\nQ: And facilities after that?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Facilities are important. What I'm looking to do in this National Realignment Strategy is to make sure that we're using our current resources most effectively. That's why when I'm spending money on vacant and underutilized buildings that aren't helping veterans, I want to realign that to help invest back into our facilities that need for capital repairs.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, leaders of the American Legion wrote a rather impassioned op-ed last week that suggested that a promising solution to the suicide problem could be increased medical use of cannabis. You talked about it being a national health crisis that requires all of government. Should the Congress reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to allow for it to be better used for medical purposes?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, right now, federal law does not prevent us at VA to look at that as an option for veterans. I believe that everything that could help veterans should be debated by Congress and by medical experts, and we will implement that law.\nSo if there is compelling evidence that this is helpful, I hope that people take a look at that and come up with the right decision, and then we will implement that.\nQ: As a physician, what's your opinion?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: My opinion is, is that some of the states that have put in appropriate controls, there may be some evidence that this is beginning to be helpful. And we're interested in looking at that and learning from that. But until the time that federal law changes, we are not able to be able to prescribe medical marijuana for conditions that may be helpful.\nQ: Your department has issued multiple reports saying climate change threatens the health of veterans and your staff, and it strains the VA's abilities to carry out its mission, and raises the chance of both healthcare emergencies and vector-borne diseases. So I guess, in the spirit of the candid assessment that you said you were doing today, do you continue to see climate change as a dire threat to your mission? And if so, are you disappointed that the President is reportedly pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, or at least reducing U.S. climate targets?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: As the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, I'm focused on those environmental issues that impact veterans, and our studies are focused on usually the chemical and the environmental impacts that are used on the battlefield. Those are the ones that I continue to be focused on. And beyond that, it really is beyond my scope as Secretary.\nQ: You don't believe -- or you're sort of repudiating the multiple reports that have come out of your department that say climate change in the broader sense -- things like cardiovascular disease -- is a real kind of issue for your department. That's not something that you're even considering at this point?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Look, I am focused on the health of our veterans. And, clearly, there's a relationship between health and the environment. What I'm not focused on is the bigger political issues about United States policy on other types of reform. I'm focused on the health of veterans.\nQ: You said it's going to take $18 billion to repair these facilities. Do you have plans to close any of them?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: What we're doing is, under the National Realignment Strategy, we're looking at the best use of our current resources, because $18 billion is not a realistic number for us to be able to get to invest and put all of our facilities up to speed. So we're looking at using the current resources that we have, the best to help veterans. We are making investments. This budget this year gives us additional dollars. That's why I'm confident that this is the right budget for us, because it allows us to invest and start making significant progress into that $18 billion.\nBut I don't believe -- that was our assessment of what the entire inventory, if we rebuild it up to current standards, would take. That's not what we're seeking.\nQ: So when you walk away from this, you think that maybe some should be closed?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: We want to take a look at every facility to make sure it's being utilized appropriately. I do not have specific plans for ay facility closures at this point.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, what is the holdup in filling out your nominations to the Senate? And do you believe that the lack of nominations has impacted in any way the work that you're trying to do and described here today?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, one of the things that I'm very fortunate, having been here in the last administration, is that we've had pretty good continuity. And the people that are filling our acting positions are people that I've worked with, have great confidence and trust in. So we haven't really missed a beat at VA. We've been able to keep going.\nOf course, I want all of our positions filled as quickly as possible. The vetting process that's going on is a lengthy process -- I know having gone through it myself -- but it's also really important to get right. And so while we want to see it done as quickly as possible, we want to see it done thoroughly and make sure that we don't make mistakes.\nI do believe that you will see several other announcements in the next week or two about positions that we will be filling.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, two questions. You said the President's budget strengthens VA. Two specific questions about the budget. When it comes to individual un-employability, IU is drastically cut in the President's budget, and it's likely never to be made up by compensating Social Security. Why do you believe that that's acceptable and in line with the administration's promise to do better by veterans?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, let's put it -- let's take a look at this overall budget. This is a 5.5 percent increase in total budget for veterans. And when it comes mandatory funding, which is where the IU exists, we're seeing a $7 billion increase year-to-year in mandatory benefits to veterans. So this is a budget that is providing more care and services to veterans.\nIn doing so, we have a responsibility to taxpayers and to veterans to make sure that the resources of our current programs are being utilized appropriately. So we are going back and looking at programs and saying, are those resources -- could they be reallocated in different ways not to withdraw total dollars from veterans, but could they be revised and reallocated to work better for veterans?\nIn the case of IU, I think that what we've proposed is not an elimination of it, but a revision to make the program and resources that are going currently to some veterans, to help additional veterans.\nI understand that there is a lot of passion on this, and we will have plenty of time to work with Congress and with our veteran service organizations to make sure that we're getting this right.\nQ: I want to ask you one other question about the budget, but just to follow up on that, a lot of VSOs consider this stealing from them, to be changing so fundamentally the way IU is calculated. What's your response to that?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: I have such great admiration and respect for VSOs, and I understand their passion and I share their commitment that it is so important that this country honor its responsibility to our veterans. That doesn't mean that you don't go back and revisit programs that have been around for a long time and figure out different ways to use those resources, as long as they're directed to helping veterans and more veterans.\nNow, I understand there's not always going to be agreement. This is Washington, and we're always going to get passion over important topics. And I welcome comments from our veteran service organizations about how to do things better. And I know that since we share the same goal of helping veterans, that we'll get to the right answer.\nQ: Let me ask you one other thing, which is about -- the budget from the President focuses on providing care and purchasing care, less so on infrastructure. You talked a lot about infrastructure, but you know what I'm talking about in terms of the VHA and where dollars tend to go. Are you concerned about the long-term viability and the potential preference for privatization or focus on the Choice Program that's outlined in the outlays for this President's budget?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: What I think the wait time showed us is that VA can't do this alone. We have to work with the private sector. Currently right now, about one-third of all veterans are getting care outside of VA. I'm looking to build an integrated system of the very best of VA and to strengthen VA and the best of the private sector to make one system work for veterans. That's going to be our new Choice legislation.\nThis is not a privatization of VA. This is not diluting the impact of VA. Every day I'm in this job I am more and more convinced that veterans and America need a strong VA. It's essential for national security. It's essential to honor our commitment. I will not allow our policies to weaken the VA; our policies will strengthen the VA. But working with the private sector is the way to do that.\nQ: And you don't have any concerns about where these dollars are going?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: What's that?\nQ: You don't have any concerns about the long-term effects of where these dollars are going?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, of course, I have concerns. I look at this every day. But I do believe the budget and our legislative proposals that we're going to work with Congress on on Choice will come up with the best balance between private sector and the VA.\nQ: You said the majority of veteran suicides are people who aren't under VA care. Why is that? And what is being done to reach out to those vets?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: So of the 20 veterans a day that are taking their life through suicide, six are getting their care in the VA system and 14 aren't. The reason why those 14 aren't getting care is really, really important and a big focus of our research and understanding. Some of them were other than honorably discharged. That means that, as you know, 10 to 15 percent of active service members who leave the service leave with an other-than-honorable discharge that leaves them without benefits. That's why I made the decision to offer those veterans emergency mental health services.\nSecondly, homeless veterans -- very high risk for suicide, not likely to have good access to behavioral healthcare. We are -- this budget that the President put forth, additional $600 million for a total of $1.7 billion to help get veterans off the street, get them into homes, and get them the services that they need.\nThird, the conditions themselves -- depression and traumatic stress -- tend to isolate people. They tend to withdraw because of their condition. And those are the ones that we worry about the most about, which is why we say suicide is everybody's responsibility -- family members, community members. When you see people withdrawing, that is the time to reach out and get them help.\nThe veterans crisis line, which we've just staffed up -- now answering 99 percent of its calls; 1 percent now only going into rollover; 95 percent answered in 20 seconds -- is there 24 hours a day if you find a veteran who is at risk.\nAnd finally, let me just say that this issue will continue to be our top priority until we figure out all the answers how to get each of those veterans help.\nQ: Thank you. You mentioned that you identified 14 facilities that were providing lower care -- or lower standard of care than nearby private sector hospitals. Are those hospitals -- can you identify them?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes, yes, they're on our website -- the 14 one-star facilities. I think you've even published an article about this. And so those are the 14 that we're talking about.\nWhen you're a one-star facility, it means that you're not only the lowest in the VA compared to other VA hospitals, but you also are below community standard. And that's why those are the important ones to focus on.\nAnd in our Choice Program, you will see, as we go out there, we're going to be making sure that veterans have Choice in particular, where the standard of care is not being met in the private sector.\nQ: Does that mean that they've not been accredited? If they're one-star and they're below the community standard of care, does that mean they would not be accredited?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: No, all of our hospitals are accredited by the same national organizations that private sectors go through. When you talk about below standards, we're talking about averages. And so by definition, there's always going to be those that are below. VA has set a bar that is above average, that essentially we want all VA hospitals, because we believe all veterans deserve the very best care possible. So it's not a minimal standard. All of our hospitals are accredited.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nEND 12:13 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-05-31", "title": "Press Briefing by Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin"}

The two leaders emphasized that many opportunities lie ahead for United States-Vietnam relations, including increasingly enhanced political, diplomatic, economic and trade ties, and ever-growing cooperation in the areas of science and technology, national defense and security, education, people-to-people exchange, humanitarian and war legacy issues, as well as regional and international issues of mutual concern. The two leaders are committed to pursuing these opportunities under an enhanced Comprehensive Partnership, grounded in respect for the United Nations Charter and international law, each other's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and respective political systems.\nThe two sides pledged to continue high-level contacts and exchanges of delegations, including through regular dialogue between the U.S. Secretary of State and Vietnam's Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss measures to enhance the bilateral Comprehensive Partnership. They also committed to strengthen existing dialogue mechanisms, including party-to-party ties. President Trump expressed his support for Vietnam in successfully hosting APEC 2017 and noted that he looks forward to visiting Vietnam and attending the APEC Leaders' meeting in November.\nThe two leaders pledged to actively promote mutually beneficial and ever-growing economic ties to bring greater prosperity to both countries. They underscored support for continued development cooperation. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc affirmed that Vietnam would pursue a consistent policy of economic reform and international integration, creating favorable conditions for foreign companies, including those of the United States, to do business and invest in Vietnam; protecting and enforcing intellectual property; and bringing its labor laws in line with Vietnam's international commitments. The two countries affirmed the importance of promoting bilateral trade and creating favorable conditions for the businesses of both sides, particularly through the effective use of the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to address issues in United States-Vietnam relations in a constructive manner. The two leaders welcomed the resolution of several priority trade issues, including mobile phone roaming services and veterinary drugs, and they pledged to continue to work together constructively to seek resolution of other priority issues of each country, including those related to intellectual property, advertising and financial services, information-security products, white offal, distiller's dried grains, siluriformes, shrimp, mangos, and other issues. The United States noted Vietnam's interest in achieving a market economy status, and the two sides pledged to continue to consult in a cooperative and comprehensive manner via the bilateral working group. Both sides welcomed the announcement of more than $8 billion in new commercial deals. The two leaders pledged to strengthen bilateral defense ties under the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Advancing Bilateral Defense Cooperation and the 2015 Joint Vision Statement on Defense Relations. The two leaders discussed the U.S. Government's recent transfer of a Hamilton-class Coast Guard cutter to help improve Vietnam's law enforcement capabilities, and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc expressed interest in acquiring more defense equipment from the United States, including additional Coast Guard cutters. The two leaders also discussed measures to expand cooperation in such prioritized areas as humanitarian cooperation, war legacies, and maritime security. They also looked into the possibility of a visit to a Vietnamese port by a United States aircraft carrier and discussed steps to further cooperation between the naval forces of the two countries. The two leaders welcomed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on the establishment of the working group on the Cooperative Humanitarian Assistance and Medical Storage Initiative, and pledged to implement the arrangement expeditiously.\nThe two leaders pledged to strengthen cooperation in the fields of security and intelligence. The United States and Vietnam pledged to work together to combat terrorism as well as transnational and cyber-enabled crimes.

They also noted that, with over 21,000 Vietnamese students currently in higher education programs in the United States, academic ties between the two countries are strong and will be strengthened even further through Vietnam's support for the launch of the Fulbright University in Ho Chi Minh City. The United States welcomed more Vietnamese students to study in the United States and remains committed to processing visas, including for students, in an expeditious manner in accordance with United States law. The two sides also welcomed the establishment of the Peace Corps program to advance English language learning in Vietnam.\nThe two sides committed to work together to address war legacy issues, including through such joint efforts as dioxin remediation, taking note of the progress that has been made at Da Nang Airport and intent to discuss continued collaboration at Bien Hoa Airport, and the removal of unexploded ordnances. President Trump expressed appreciation for Vietnam's continuing cooperation in the humanitarian mission of accounting for United States personnel still missing from the war, and pledged to cooperate with Vietnam in its efforts to locate its missing soldiers.\nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc affirmed that Vietnam will work actively with the United States to expeditiously return Vietnamese nationals subject to final orders of removal, using the 2008 United States-Vietnam Agreement on the Acceptance of the Return of Vietnamese Citizens as a basis.

They encouraged further cooperation to ensure that everyone, including members of vulnerable groups, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, and including persons with disabilities, fully enjoy their human rights. The United States welcomed Vietnam's ongoing efforts to refine its legal system to better protect and promote human rights for everyone.\nOn regional issues, the two leaders expressed their concern for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile tests, which violate multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and escalate tensions in the region. Both sides reaffirmed their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and urged all parties concerned to strictly implement all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.\nPresident Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc affirmed that the South China Sea is a waterway of strategic significance to the international community.

The indelible legacy of these musicians—who have witnessed our Nation's greatest achievements, as well as its greatest injustices—give all Americans a richer, deeper understanding of American culture. Their creativity has shaped every genre of music, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel, hip hop, and rap.\nIn March, rock and roll lost Chuck Berry, one of its founding fathers. Berry's signature style on the guitar, on display in classics like \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" \"Maybellene,\" and \"Carol,\" came to define the explosive new sound of rock and roll. As Keith Richards, guitarist for the Rolling Stones said while introducing Berry into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: \"This is the gentleman who started it all.\"\nWe also take time this month to recognize the musical influence of two of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, as this year marks their centennial birthdays. Gillespie, through his legendary trumpet sound and Fitzgerald, through her pure, energetic voice, treated people around the world to spirited and soulful jazz music. Their work has influenced countless musicians, and continues to inspire listeners young and old.\nThe contributions of Berry, Gillespie, Fitzgerald, and other African-American musicians shine as examples of how music can bring us together. These musicians also remind us of our humanity and of our power to overcome. They expressed the soul of blues, gospel, and rock and roll, which has so often captured the hardships of racism and injustices suffered by African Americans, as well as daily joys and celebrations. Their work highlights the power music has to channel the human experience, and they remain a testament to the resilience of all freedom-loving people. We are grateful for their contribution to the cannon of great American art.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as African-American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and appreciation of African-American Music.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Americans can go fishing in Eleven Mile State Park in Colorado, camp on the bluffs of Perrot State Park in Wisconsin, and bike along the Sable River in Ludington State Park in Michigan. These lands and waters are also home to cultural and historic sites that inspire our love of country and serve as important touchstones for who we are as Americans.\nWhether your great outdoors means a community park, a state reservoir, a national forest, or a backyard campout, we must cherish our outdoor spaces and work to preserve them for generations. This is why, as President, I am working to bring leaders throughout the country together to improve the management of our vitally important public lands, especially through public-private partnerships to help clear the backlog of deferred maintenance.\nI urge all Americans to set aside time during the month of June to visit our great outdoors and experience America's natural and cultural history.

For generations of Americans, owning a home has been an essential element in achieving the American Dream. Homeownership is often the foundation of security and prosperity for families and communities and an enduring symbol of American freedom. This month, we recommit to ensuring that hard-working Americans enjoy a fair chance at becoming homeowners.\nIn the years since the Great Recession, homeownership rates have dipped to historic lows. Many Americans are not confident they will ever own a home, a tragic consequence of a decade of weak economic growth, excessive regulations, and stagnant wages. Many young families are unable to achieve the independence they desire because they have difficulty saving for a down payment, overcoming regulatory burdens, or gaining access to adequate credit. These challenges are even more pronounced for minorities, whose homeownership rates remain substantially below those of their fellow Americans.\nI am committed to helping hard-working Americans become homeowners. As part of my Administration's plan to strengthen the middle class and the American housing market, I am working with the Congress on a pro-growth agenda of reducing rules and regulations, cutting taxes, and eliminating unnecessary government spending. These policies will unshackle our economy and create and sustain high-paying jobs so that more Americans have the resources and freedom they deserve to fulfill their American Dream.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National Homeownership Month.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

This month, we recognize the importance of harnessing the seas for our national security and prosperity.\nThirty-four years ago, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the creation of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, making clear America's sovereign right to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage ocean resources extending 200 nautical miles from our shores. This is the world's largest Exclusive Economic Zone, spanning more than 3.4 million square nautical miles—an area larger than the combined landmass of all 50 States. We must recognize the importance of our offshore areas to our security and economic independence, all while protecting the marine environment for present and future generations.\nToday, our offshore areas remain underutilized and often unexplored. We have yet to fully leverage new technologies and unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy. In the field of energy, we have just begun to tap the potential of our oceans' oil and gas, wind, wave, and tidal resources to power the Nation. The fisheries resources of the United States are among the most valuable in the world. Growing global demand for seafood presents tremendous opportunities for expansion of our seafood exports, which can reduce our more than $13 billion seafood trade deficit.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National Ocean Month. This month, I call upon Americans to reflect on the value and importance of the oceans not only to our security and economy, but also as a source of recreation, enjoyment, and relaxation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

They've just made a very large order in the United States—and we appreciate that—for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam.\nAnd I just want to thank you very much for you and all of your representatives to be with us today.
