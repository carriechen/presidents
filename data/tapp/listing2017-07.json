Thank you very much. Boy, this is some group. Some group. Nice to win, isn't it? Isn't it nice to win? Robert, thank you very much for that incredible introduction, and thank you to everyone from First Baptist Dallas. Thank you. Pastor, you and Amy have stood with us since the very, very beginning, and I will always stand with you. I've told you that, and I mean that. I will always be with you. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nAnd I'm honored to join you at the first-ever Fourth of July \"Freedom\" rally taking place here at the Kennedy Center as we pay tribute to those who have proudly served our Nation in uniform. Thank you very much.\nTonight we have been inspired by music that fills our hearts, stirs our souls, and reminds us all of who we are: one Nation under God.\nTo First Baptist music director, Doran Bugg, and to every musician and member of the choir who has performed with such incredible grace and skill—and I heard them backstage; I said, let me out there—that is the most beautiful music. [Laughter] Beautiful. I just want to say that your music honors our heroes more eloquently than words could ever do. And I just want to thank you. That's real talent standing behind me. Thank you, folks. Thank you very much.\nAnd let me say to the hundreds of veterans with us tonight, that for my very first Independence Day celebration as President, there is no place I'd rather be than with you, I'll tell you that. And I promise you—and you see it happening day by day. Just the other day, we signed Veterans Accountability. They've been trying to do it for 40 years. For 40 years, they've been trying. You couldn't fire somebody if they were horrible, doing a terrible job for the veterans: robbing, stealing, hurting people. You couldn't do anything. It's called the Veterans Accountability Act, and now you can say, \"You're fired.\" Thank you. And I promise you that we will always take care of our great veterans, always. Right, Louie? You'd better believe it. And Paula is up there. Paula White has been so helpful.\nAudience members. We love you!\nThe President. Thank you. I love you too actually. [Laughter]\nYou've shed your blood, you've poured your love, and you've bared your soul in defense of our country, our people, and our great American flag. Your loyalty to our Nation is measured not merely in words, but in deeds. You raced through gunfire, stared down enemy forces, and ran past the gates of hell to fight and to win for America. And you won for America. And we're going to take care of it. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nThe story of America's men and women in uniform is the story of freedom and overcoming oppression, the strong protecting the weak, and the good defeating evil. There's a lot of evil out there, I want to tell you. There's a lot of evil. I was left a mess, the fact is. But we're cleaning it up. You watch. Cleaning it up. [Applause] Cleaning it up.\nWe are awed by your service and your sacrifice. And so to the veterans here tonight—of which there are many—will you please stand right now? Please stand. Thank you. On behalf of our very grateful Nation, thank you very much. Thank you very much. We will always, always remember what you did for us. Tonight we celebrate veterans. We also reflect on everything we cherish as Americans: We love our country, we love our families, we love our freedom, and we love our God. Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago, America always affirmed that liberty comes from our Creator. Our rights are given to us by God, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away.\nThat is why my administration is transferring power out of Washington and returning that power back to where it belongs: to the people. To the people. The fake media is trying to silence us—[laughter]—but we will not let them, because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm President, and they're not. We won, and they lost. The fact is, the press has destroyed themselves, because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used the hatchet, and the people saw it right from the beginning. The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our great American people. It will never happen.\nTheir agenda is not your agenda. You've been saying it. I will never stop fighting for you. I am delivering on trade, on the economy, on the Supreme Court, on the Second Amendment, on our military, for our veterans, and on our borders, where we are doing record, record stoppage. Thank you. And we are supporting our incredible police and law enforcement. We will save American lives, protect American sovereignty, and we will ensure the forgotten men and women of our country are never forgotten again.\nFor too long, politicians have tried—oh, have they tried—to centralize authority among the hands of a small few in our Nation's Capital. I see them all the time. Bureaucrats think they can run over your lives, overrule your values, meddle in your faith, and tell you how to live, what to say, and where to pray. But we know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children and create a thriving society. And we know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create a strong and loving community.\nAnd above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government, we worship God.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Our religious liberty is enshrined in the very First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. The American Founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer. I remind you that we're going to start saying \"Merry Christmas\" again. [Laughter] Right? [Applause] True, true. Inscribed on our currency are the words: \"In God We Trust.\" But not only has God bestowed on us the gift of freedom, He's also given us the gift of heroes willing to give their lives to defend that freedom. You just stood.\nIn every struggle against evil throughout our history, as America's servicemembers have huddled around campfires and sought refuge in foxholes, they have called on their Creator for support. In World War II, when General George Patton—and that was a real general—[laughter]—we've got some Pattons today too. I found them. \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, right? And he doesn't like doing a lot of talking, but I want to tell you, ISIS, it's a whole different ballgame, folks. [Laughter] It's—they're going fast. [Laughter]\nBut when Patton ran into a problem that he couldn't solve, he knew what to do: He prayed. Frustrated by rains that were stalling the advance of his Third Army across Europe in early December 1944—horrible weather—Patton asked an Army chaplain to come up with a \"good prayer for the weather.\" Patton then had a quarter of a million copies of that prayer printed and distributed to the soldiers of the Third Army just before the Battle of the Bulge. That was a big one. Did very well there. [Laughter]\nFive hundred thousand American soldiers fought that pivotal battle of the Second World War. One of those soldiers is here with us tonight. His name is Harry F. Miller. Where's Harry? Where's Harry? Harry. Stand up, Harry. [Applause] Thank you, Harry.\nLike many of the heroes of his generation, Harry wasn't exactly straightforward about his age when he enlisted in the Army Reserves. Shame on you, Harry. [Laughter] He was just 15, but he told them he was old enough to join. Then, he immediately asked for a transfer to Active Duty.\nSix months after he enlisted, Private Miller was on his way to Europe to fight for our country. [Applause] Great. A couple months after that, he was in the freezing cold. How cold was it, Harry? Cold. He said, \"Really cold.\" [Laughter] And driving rains of Belgium with the 740th Tank Battalion attached to the 82d Airborne.\nAs the Battle of the Bulge began, Harry got his orders to go find tanks at a weapons storage facility. When he arrived, he says, he and his friends found nothing but tanks. They were all over the place, right? Nothing but tanks. But they didn't let the tanks stop them. Out of what spare parts they could find, and through sheer grit and resolve, they somehow managed to repair three of those tanks and to get them all set for action and ready to fight. And before long, those three tanks were nose to nose with the lead elements of a German SS Panzer division. And that was tough stuff. In a short time, those tanks had knocked out the first three tanks of the enemy, and the entire German division retreated. They left. Good. That's good, Harry. [Applause] That's good, Harry.\nAudience members. Harry! Harry! Harry!\nThe President. Stand up! Harry fought through the battle and the rest of the war, and he went on to serve in our Armed Forces for 22 years, retiring as a Senior Master Sergeant. A lot of guts. Tomorrow Harry will be 89. Tomorrow, 89. So on behalf of this very large group in this beautiful building, Senior Master Sergeant Miller, happy birthday. Thank you for your lifetime of service. And thank you for helping out. Thank you very much, Harry.\nTo every veteran with us tonight, from every branch of the military—Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard—I want you to know that we will always keep our promises to those who have kept us free. Since my very first day in office, we've taken one action after another to make sure that our veterans get the care they so richly deserve. We've published wait times—those wait times were bad, weren't they? But, boy, are they getting better and fast. And we've published them at every VA facility; delivered same-day mental health services at every VA Medical Center; nearly doubled the number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice; and as I said, just signed brandnew legislation—went through the House, went through the Senate. And I signed it so fast—we didn't want to take any chances, right, Harry?—to ensure every VA worker is held accountable for the quality of care they provide to our veterans.\nTonight we are deeply honored to be joined by a number of wounded warriors from Walter Reed. I was over there recently. These are incredible people: the enthusiasm and the spirit. And some of them were hurt really badly. They've got so much spirit, and they love this country so much. These American heroes risked everything so that you and I can live in freedom. They gave all they had—everything—for their comrades, their country, and for victory. They like winning. We like winning again, don't we? You know, in the old days, we used to win. We, sort of, just keep fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting. We're going to win again, folks. We applaud their strength, their courage, and we really support that incredible win that they have—the will. The will is so strong. And that's what they want to do, is they want to win, and they want to win for you. So thank you all very much for being here. That was great.\nOne such hero is Captain Luis Avila. Where is he? Luis. Luis. Where are you, Luis? We love you, Luis. [Applause] Luis, wow. Luis is here tonight, along with his wife Claudia. Thank you, Claudia. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Thank you. Luis served in the Army for 16 years. He held many different positions on five combat tours. And he was always a leader, and everybody always said—I did some checking on you, Luis—[laughter]—that you did a great job no matter where you were, no matter where you went. On his fifth deployment, Luis bravely led his company on a successful mission to recover vital intelligence. During this critical mission, his vehicle was struck by explosives. Luis was gravely wounded and lost his leg. He received a Purple Heart for his service and sacrifice.\nTo Luis and Claudia, we will never forget the courageous sacrifice that you made for all of us in this room tonight and for everyone in our country. Thank you. Thank you, Luis. I want you all and all of our incredible wounded warriors to know: You have an entire nation of more than 300 million people behind you. And our Nation is getting strong again. Do you notice? Getting strong again. Our hearts and our prayers are joined with yours. Your legacy, like our gratitude, will live forever. And I want to thank you. Thank you very much. And, Claudia, thank you very much. Thank you.\nI also want to speak to all of the people—see, you thought I forgot—in our faith community who are here with us tonight, veterans and nonveterans alike. You're never going to be forgotten. You'll never be forgotten. My administration will always support and defend your religious liberty.\nWe don't want to see God forced out of the public square, driven out of our schools, or pushed out of our civic life. We want to see prayers before football games if they want to give prayers. Right? [Applause] Right? We want all children to have the opportunity to know the blessings of God.\nWe will not allow the Government to censor sermons, to restrict the free speech of our pastors and our preachers and the people that we most respect, like Robert. That is why, just as I promised Pastor Jeffress and other faith leaders, I just signed an Executive order following—and this is something that makes me very happy and very proud—following through on my campaign pledge to stop the Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights. As long as I am President, no one is going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart. We want to hear Him.\nOne of the most grave and dire threats to religious freedom in the world today is the threat of terrorism, and specifically, it just seems it's called radical Islamic terrorism. And we cannot allow terrorism and extremism to spread in our country or to find sanctuary on our shores or in our cities. We want to make sure that anyone who seeks to join our country shares our values and has the capacity to love our people. Thank you.\nTogether, we will protect our families, our nations, and our borders. And yes, by the way, for those that are curious, we will build the wall, okay? [Laughter] Because we understand that a country is more than just its geography. A nation is the sum of its citizens: their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations. America is a land rich with history, traditions and values. And as we have seen tonight—what a group this is tonight—America is also a land rich with heroes.\nAnd though we have many stories, we all share one home and one glorious destiny, a destiny that's getting better and better every single day. And whether we are Black or Brown or White—and you've heard me say this before—we all bleed the same red blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same Almighty God.\nWe face many challenges. There are many hills and mountains to climb. But with the strength and courage of the patriots assembled in this room tonight, we will scare—I mean, and you see, and you see it all the time, and we're doing it all the time, because we're scaling those summits—and we will get the job done. We will all prove worthy of this very important moment in history, and we will prove worthy of the sacrifice that our brave veterans have made.\nAs long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, we will not fail. As long as our country remains true to its values, loyal to its heroes, and devoted to its Creator, then our best days are yet to come, because we will make America great again.\nTo my friend, Pastor Jeffress, and to Paula and to Louie and to Harry and to Luis and to everybody in this room and everybody in this country: Thank you for your great support. I appreciate it. I will not let you down. To all of our incredible veterans, to the people in the military, and to evangelical Christians who came out in record, record, record numbers: Thank you.\nHave a wonderful Independence Day. God bless you. God bless our Nation's veterans. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-07-01", "title": "Remarks at a \"Celebrate Freedom\" Rally"}

The rain stopped just as we came out. [Laughter] I don't know what that means, but it's not bad. [Laughter] And happy Fourth of July. Great honor to have you with us. Melania and I truly appreciate and celebrate America's independence with those who courageously defend our country: the men, women, and families of the United States military.\nIt is because of you that well over 300 million American citizens can live in freedom. There is one military family here today I am especially excited to recognize: Our great Vice President, Mike Pence, and our Second Lady—never heard that term before, but that's what they say—and she is some lady, that I can tell you—of the United States, Karen Pence, are here along with their son, Marine First Lieutenant Michael Pence. Where is Michael? [Applause] Great. It's great, Michael. Michael, not only are your parents proud of you, not only am I proud of you, but America, Michael, is very proud of you. Thank you.\nAnd America is proud of all of the brave men and women who serve in every branch of our great military. We have outstanding representatives of each service, each branch. They're with us today. We have Army. We have Navy. We have Air Force. We have Marines. We have Coast Guard. [Laughter] We love our Coast Guard.\nRepresenting the United States Army is Captain Jean Gwon. She served 14 years, and today, she is company commander in support of Old Guard, where she oversees the 120 soldiers who protect the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It's beautiful. Captain Gwon is joined today by her husband, Captain James Folwell. Thank you both for your service, and thank you to every soldier here with us today and serving our Nation and serving us all around the world. You are truly the army of the free.\nFrom the Marines, we have Marine Sergeant Yannick Tumukunde. He's with Marine Helicopter Squadron One, an outfit I've come to know and admire very much since arriving at the White House. Sergeant Tumukunde is senior technician and is the sole chief martial arts instructor and trainer for the entire squadron. Thank you, and thank you for being here. And also, we lay claim to a very special title. You are a United States marine. That is a special title. Thank you, Sergeant.\nFrom the Navy, we have Lieutenant Commander Allison Maybrey, a Navy oceanographer. Her leadership has improved the atmosphere. And really, what she's done is so incredible, having to do with sensing, modeling, and predicting the electromagnetic warfare capabilities of various countries that, hopefully, we won't be thinking about too much. But she's there, and she's got the information like nobody has. We thank Allison and her husband, Lieutenant Commander Michael Maybrey, here with their children Emma, Lily, and Amelia. Our incredible sailors embody the Navy credo: \"Not for self, but for country.\" Thank you.\nFrom the Air Force, we have Technical Sergeant Ralph Bunnell. Sergeant Bunnell is responsible for leading 50 Security Forces personnel that protect the President, the Vice President, and visiting foreign heads of state. A big job, a very important job. We want to thank you—to Ralph and to your wife Patricia. And thank you to every member of the Air Force who gives our Nation total superiority in the air, striking fear into the hearts of our enemies and inspiring hope in the hearts of our friends all around the world. Finally, representing the Coast Guard we have Petty Officer First Class Tony Franklin. Tony is a gunner's mate and is directly responsible for the armament of 17 units. He has led countless gunnery and pyrotechnic demonstrations, so I don't think the fireworks are going to impress him very much, but I will tell you, they're going to impress you. [Laughter] Thank you, Tony.\nI want to thank everyone in the Coast Guard. I was at the Coast Guard Academy this year—gave the commencement address—and it was an amazing, incredible group of people and a really great day. Thank you, Tony, very much.\nEach of you here today represents that rare combination of patriotism, virtue, and courage that our citizens have always—and I mean always—admired and that our enemies have always feared. At this moment, your brothers-and-sisters-in-arms are posted around the globe, fighting our enemies and standing watch to protect our Nation. They're fighting for us. We are thanking them, praying for them, and saluting them for their selfless sacrifice.\nThere could be no greater privilege than to serve as your Commander in Chief. I pledge my unwavering support for you, for your families, and your missions. I will always have you back. I will always, under all circumstances—you'll be coming back here, and I will always have your back.\nAnd I want to just tell you that our country is doing really, really well. No matter where you look, the economy is blazing. And on every front we're doing well. And we do have challenges, but we will handle those challenges, believe me.\nYou're part of a new and a truly great generation. Two days ago, I spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole, who served as the copilot of the lead B-25 bomber pilot and piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle during the daring 1942 raid after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lieutenant Colonel Cole and the rest of the Doolittle Raiders launched their aircraft into the sky knowing that they would not have enough fuel to return to friendly territory. That's not a good feeling. That's a lot of courage.\nOur service men and women are preserving the legacy of courage and selfless service that they inherited from Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole and so many others.\nMay God bless you all. May God bless our military. May God bless forever the United States of America.\nThank you very much for being here. Happy Fourth of July. Thank you very much. Thank you. Happy Fourth of July, everybody. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-07-04", "title": "Remarks at an Independence Day Celebration"}

(Applause.)\nIn his Inaugural Address, the President rededicated our nation to once again lead in the heavens, and in his words \"unlock the mysteries of space.\"\nWith this President, it's always about leadership -- American leadership. And that begins at home, by putting the security and prosperity of America first. Today, we will speak of this President's vision for American leadership in space. But between those two spheres, in Warsaw, Poland today, we were reminded that the American President is the leader of the free world. (Applause.)\nToday, President Trump stood in Krasinski Square in a rebuilt Warsaw, giving testament to the power of free peoples to assert their own destinies and claim their own futures.\nThe President noted in his words that as long we know our history we will know how to build a future, saying that Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign, and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and our interests.\nThe President took the opportunity to challenge our allies to work together to confront forces that threaten over time to undermine those values and erase the bonds of culture, faith, and tradition that make us who we are. And he called on all of our allies in the West to what he called a \"commitment of will,\" and he reminded us that the defense of the West ultimately rests in his words \"not only on means but also on the will of our people to prevail.\"\nFinally, he reminded the world today that our own fight for the West does not begin on a battlefield, it begins with our minds, our wills, our souls, our freedom -- and that our survival depends on the bonds of history, culture, and memory.\nMy fellow Americans, that's what American leadership looks like on the world stage. (Applause.)\nAnd today I come to assure you, the men and women of NASA, and all those at this Gateway to the Stars, where the aspirations of the American people have taken flight that under President Donald Trump America will lead in space once again. (Applause.)\nJust last week, President Trump declared that America is in his words \"going to be leading\" in exploration and discovery \"like we've never led before.\" Welcome to a new era of American leadership in space. (Applause.)\nI can't think of a better place to deliver this message than here at the Kennedy Space Center, named for a President who challenged America to undertake, as he said, \"the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.\"\nThe Kennedy Space Center is the heart and soul of our nation's space program, where science fiction has become science fact for generations. Just this past Saturday, this center celebrated its 55th birthday. And for 55 years, you have relentlessly expanded our horizons and given us so many national heroes.\nHere, the crew of Apollo 11 set sail for the Sea of Tranquility on the moon. Here, you launched America's Space Shuttles and America's astronauts to orbit this Blue Marble. Here, the Hubble Space Telescope, the New Horizons, and so many other technological wonders lifted off from Earth to give us a glimpse of our fellow planets, the distant stars, and the infinite galaxies that are a window into our very past.\nAnd from this \"Bridge to Space,\" our nation will return to the Moon, and we will put American boots on the face of Mars. (Applause.)\nMy friends, the missions that began at the Kennedy Space Center are carved into the mantle of American greatness. And more than that, they're etched into the hearts and minds of the American people.\nGenerations of Americans have marveled at and been inspired by what you do here. We've joined in your countdowns, rejoiced in your successes, and we've grieved with you in your sorrows -- because the missions that start at the Kennedy Space Center have captivated the American people and carried our hopes and dreams into the heavens as almost no other national initiative.\nI caught a passion for the space program when I was just a little boy in a small town in Southern Indiana. Some of the most precious memories of my youth were gathered around a black-and-white television, watching images of American heroes making history.\nAs a member of Congress, I asked to serve on the NASA subcommittee, and I had the privilege, along with my wife and children, to attend several space shuttle launches.\nI really have no doubt that my son, who is now a Marine Corps aviator, was inspired to serve as a 10-year-old boy when we sat in the grandstands here at the Kennedy Space Center and watched in awe as America's heroic astronauts hurtled into space.\nI said at the time, that to see the sights and sounds of a launch at here Cape Canaveral was like seeing the Earth giving birth to a piece of the sun and sending it home.\nAnd you're the ones who make it possible. So give yourselves a round of applause for making miracles happen, for making science fiction, science fact here at the Kennedy Space Center. (Applause.)\nThe truth is that your work breaks new ground and breaks records in equal measure. And serving each and every day with this President, I can say with confidence: The American space program has a champion in the President of the United States. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has a deep appreciation for the vital work that NASA does each and every day. That was on full display earlier this year when in the Oval Office President Trump signed the first NASA reauthorization act in more than seven years. (Applause.)\nSurrounded by many of these same members of Congress who join us here today, after the bill's signing, President Trump renewed our nation's commitment to, in his words \"NASA's mission of exploration and discovery\" -- because he knows that every day, the men and women of NASA inspire the American people and enrich the American spirit.\nPresident Donald Trump is already ensuring that NASA has the resources and support you need to make new history from this place; inspire new generations and advance American leadership in the boundless frontier of space -- of that you can be assured.\nAllow me just to take a moment to single out Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson and all the distinguished members of Congress who are here with us today. Would you all mind standing and allowing everyone here to show our appreciation for the great champions of human exploration in space that all of you are? Please rise, and give these leaders in the House and in the United States Senate a big round of applause, would you, please? (Applause.) Thank you so much.\nPresident Trump's vision for space, though, is much larger than NASA alone. Our President is transforming our entire space policy to seize the opportunities of the 21st century and unleash the infinite potential of the cosmos for the American people.\nExtending our nation's leadership in space is one of the greatest challenges of our day. And just as we have risen to the challenges that came before, so too we will rise to meet the new challenges that lie ahead.\nThat's why just last Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to relaunch the National Space Council and guide a new era of space leadership by the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAfter being dormant since 1993, I'm proud to report that the National Space Council is up and running once again. And it will be my great honor, as Vice President of the United States, to serve as its chair. (Applause.)\nAs the President said last week, the National Space Council, in his words, \"will be a central hub guiding space policy within the administration,\" filling a void that's existed in America for nearly a quarter-century.\nThis is actually the third iteration of the National Space Council. American Presidents from Eisenhower to Kennedy, Johnson to Nixon to George H.W. Bush all turned to the National Space Council for assistance and advice.\nIt was under the first National Space Council's watch that America put a man in space, put a man on the moon -- and with less than a decade between them. And the second council saw our nation through the close of the Cold War, as space became ever more important to our national security.\nAs you men and women of NASA know, the American people have never lost our passion to explore space and uncover its secrets. But for nearly 25 years, our government's commitment seems to have not matched the spirit American people. But I'm here to tell you that as we still enter this new century, we will beat back any disadvantage that our lack of attention has placed, and America will once again lead in space for the benefit and the security of all our people and all of the world. (Applause.)\nOur National Space Council will reenergize our pioneering spirit in space. It will restore our confidence and the confidence that we can and will achieve the impossible -- just like you all here at NASA have done so many times in the course of my life. It will ensure that America once again takes our rightful place as the vanguard of humanity's historic rendezvous with the future in the outer limits of space.\nThe council will bring together leaders from the President's administration including our Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Transportation, and Homeland Security, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our National Security Advisor, our intelligence leadership, and the NASA Administrator. And I look forward to holding the first meeting of the National Space Council before the summer is out. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has given the Council the duty in his words to \"advise and assist\" his administration regarding national space policy and strategy, and we'll be busy doing just that.\nWe'll review our current policy and our long-range goals and coordinate national space activities -- from national security to commerce to exploration and beyond.\nAnd crucially, at the President's direction, we will, in his words, foster close coordination, cooperation, technology and information exchange among all the stakeholders and sectors involved in space activity -- including government agencies, the armed forces, and leaders from the realms of private industry and the academic world. We will bring the best of America together once again to lead with Americans in space. (Applause.)\nAs the President said last week, the National Space Council intends to draw on the expertise and insights of scientists, innovators, and business leaders in a whole new way.\nThese leaders, whom the President and I will be naming in the coming weeks, will form a User Advisory Group. And I know with confidence that their work will dramatically enhance our space policy in the days ahead just as it has in the past.\nI'm particularly excited to see the increased collaboration with our burgeoning commercial space industry so much in evidence here at the Kennedy Space Center. I'm really sorry that I missed the successful commercial launch that took place last night. I was praying for rain at the Kennedy Space Center so we might see that rocket go up today.\nBut the truth is we're going to continue to foster stronger partnerships between government agencies and innovative industries across this country because both have so much to offer one another.\nIn fact, Kennedy Space Center is proof that public and private sectors can achieve more by working together than they could ever achieve apart. This center is today the world's premier multi-use spaceport, and that truth will only continue to grow. (Applause.)\nIn conjunction with our commercial partners, we'll continue to make space travel safer, cheaper, and more accessible than ever before.\nThe truth is that American business is on the cutting edge of space technology. And under President Trump's leadership, and with the guidance of the National Space Council, we'll tap into the limitless well of American innovation because there is no problem the American people can't solve, no barrier we can't break down, no objective we can't achieve when we bring the full force of our national interest and creativity to bear.\nThe American spirit is as limitless as space itself. And so we will bring that spirit fully to bear on the trials that lie ahead. If we can dream it, we can do it. And under President Trump, we will achieve more in space than we ever thought possible.\nPresident Trump observed just last week, \"the human soul yearns for discovery,\" and I would say that's especially true for those of us who have the privilege to call ourselves Americans. Under President Donald Trump's leadership, we will reorient America's space program toward human space exploration and discovery for the benefit of the American people and all of the world. (Applause.)\nWe will return our nation to the moon. We will go to Mars, and we will go still further to places that our children's children can only imagine.\nWe will maintain a constant presence in low-Earth orbit, and we will develop policies that will carry human space exploration across our solar system and ultimately into the vast expanse of space.\nAs the President has said, space is in his words the \"next great American frontier.\" And like the pioneers that came before us, we will settle that frontier with American leadership, American courage, and American ingenuity.\nAs we once again lead in space exploration, we will continue to make the investments and presence in space to ensure the safety and security of the American people. Space is vital to our national security. I saw it firsthand when I visited Schriever Air Force Base just a few weeks ago. And I can assure you, under President Donald Trump, American security will be as dominant in the heavens as we are here on Earth. (Applause.)\nThe tasks that lie before us requires the highest levels of courage, commitment, and dedication. The challenges will be difficult. But difficulty brings out America's best, and America's best can't be beaten by anybody at any time.\nSome 55 years ago, the namesake of this base, President John F. Kennedy, declared that America would put a man on the moon before the decade was out, a feat unlike any imagined in human history.\nAs he said at the time, we were willing to accept the challenge, and unwilling to postpone it, and that challenge is one in his words -- \"one which we intend to win.\" And with your forbearers here at the Kennedy Space Center and Houston and all across NASA, we did win the race to the moon. (Applause.)\nWe won the race a half-century ago, and now we will get back to wining in the 21st century and beyond.\nUnder the leadership of President Donald Trump and with the guidance of the National Space Council, the United States of America will usher in a new era of space leadership that will benefit every facet of our national life.\nWe will strengthen our economy. We will unlock new opportunities, new technologies, and new sources of prosperity. We will inspire our children to seek education in science, technology, engineering, and math. We'll enhance our common defense and advance the security of the American people.\nBut most of all, under President Trump's leadership, we will renew the American spirit itself.\nI know in my heart that today the heavens are closer than ever before. We're restarting a journey that will take us to new heights of knowledge, new heights of accomplishment. And above all, I know with confidence that we will reach those new heights of American leadership with American values and American ingenuity.\nAs President Trump said last week in his words, \"It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.\"\nAnd with the National Space Council, we will grab that destiny with both hands and go to work with each and every one of you.\nSo let us go forth and start this new chapter of that adventure. Let us have the courage and the confidence that's always defined who we are as Americans. And let us do what our nation has always done since its very founding and beyond: We've pushed the boundaries on frontiers, not just of territory but of knowledge. We've blazed new trails, and we've astonished the world as we've boldly grasped our future without fear.\nAnd as we go, let us have faith -- faith that as we enter this new era of exploration and discovery, that this rising generation of American explorers and innovators will once again deliver on the hopes and aspirations of our people just like you've done before.\nAnd as this new generation of astronauts suits up, let them have the faith that they do so surrounded by the prayers of the American people with the absolute assurance that as they rocket into the heavens, they do not go alone.\nFor as the Psalmist teaches us, if we rise on the wings of the dawn, if we go up to the heavens, even there His hand will guide us, and His right hand will hold us fast.\nMy friends, the future beckons -- and so do the furthest depths of space. Together, as one nation and one people, we will raise our eyes to gaze with wonder at the stars and once again renew our commitment to reach out our hands and touch the heavens.\nWith confidence in all of you and with confidence in the strong vision and leadership of President Donald Trump, I know America will lead in space once again.\nThank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

In his remarks, he referred to President Andrzej Duda of Poland, who introduced the President.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126553", "text": "President Trump. Well, thank you very much. I greatly appreciate it. This is a beautiful room, I must say. I love beautiful rooms, and this is one of them. I want to thank you, President. And President, thank you very much. Good to see you again\nPresident Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic of Croatia. Thank you. Good to see you too.\nPresident Trump. ——for hosting this historic summit. I'm honored to be here in a city where, as it's been said many times before, the impossible has become the possible. And thanks to the 11 leaders in this room, I think that the expression will become the story of this incredible initiative. I want to congratulate you on the great job you've done.\nThis region has special significance to me because, as you know, my wife, is from Slovenia. Right? We spoke about it. Very good. And she loves Slovenia.\nEvery one of your nations has an inspiring story. You've overcame years of oppression, and you all are united by the hope that your citizens will flourish, your commerce will prosper, and your countries will absolutely thrive. That's what's going to happen, because I know the people. This is the spirit of hope that brings us all together.\nWe're here at this historic gathering to launch a new future for open, fair, and affordable energy markets that bring greater security and prosperity to all of our citizens. We are sitting on massive energy, and we are now exporters of energy. So one of you need energy, just give us a call.\nOn behalf of the American people, let me say that we stand with the Three Seas nations. Beautiful nations, by the way. Beautiful country. We support your drive for greater prosperity and security. We applaud your initiative to expand infrastructure. We welcome this historic opportunity to deepen our economic partnership with your region.\nIt's been 28 years since your brave citizens lifted the Iron Curtain and defeated communism, yet much of the infrastructure within Central and Eastern Europe has remained a relic of the old Soviet era. It's pretty incredible. Your people have been held back by the old roads, railways, and pipelines that still operate on restrictive systems.\nThe Three Seas Initiative will transform and rebuild the entire region and ensure that your infrastructure, like your commitment to freedom and rule of law, binds you to all of Europe and, indeed, to the West.\nThe United States also strongly supports the creation of the Three Seas Business Forum so that your countries can build cutting-edge projects with the best talent in the energy industry, and do so under budget and ahead of schedule. I love that sound: under budget and ahead of schedule. [Laughter] Nothing like it.\nNew energy infrastructure is essential to this rebuilding effort. We hope that the Three Seas nations will advance the same goals we are working on to achieve for our people in America. We're doing tremendously well. Our stock market just hit an alltime high. We have, I think, 16 years the—in 16 years, it's the lowest unemployment rate. Our military is getting stronger and stronger. We're rebuilding it, adding billions and billions of dollars of new equipment, the best equipment in the world. We make the best equipment in the world by far. We're adding many billions of dollars of brandnew equipment.\nAnd the United States is doing very well, very strong. We've taken off restrictions, and people are really moving hard. So when I say that the stock market is at an alltime high, we've picked up in market value almost $4 trillion since November 8, which was the election. Four trillion dollars, it's a lot of money. Personally, I picked up nothing, but that's all right. [Laughter] Everyone else is getting rich. That's okay. I'm very happy.\nGreater access to energy markets, fewer barriers to energy trade and development and strengthening energy security is what we're looking to do. The Three Seas Initiative has the potential to accomplish all of these essential objectives—and very quickly—because you have incredible people, and they will get it done quickly.\nI congratulate your nations for already beginning the critical projects that open us up to greater access, and you'll be totally open and have access to energy markets and remove barriers to energy trade, such as floating LNG terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. Did you ever hear of that? Right? [Laughter] Huh? You know all about that.\nPresident Grabar-Kitarovic. I can even spell it.\nPresident Trump. I'll bet you know all about it. [Laughter] And the Greece-Bulgaria Interconnector.\nThese projects and many others are crucial to ensuring that your nations continue to diversify your energy sources, suppliers, and routes. I also applaud Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Austria for pursuing a pipeline from the Black Sea. We just approved a big pipeline also, the Keystone Pipeline. It was under consideration for many, many years, and it was dead, and I approved it in my first day of office. And it's now under construction. And another pipeline besides that—big ones—Dakota Access.\nThe United States is proud to see that our abundant energy resources are already helping the Three Seas nations achieve much-needed energy diversification. In fact, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and people of Poland for receiving their first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas last month. And you made a very good deal, I understand.\nLet me be very clear about one crucial point: The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so. You don't want to have a monopoly or a monopolistic situation. The United States is firmly committed to open, fair, and competitive markets for global energy trade.\nAmerica will be a faithful and dependable partner in the export and sale of our high-quality and low-cost energy resources and technology. We make the best technology, and we make the best, best technology for fighter jets and ships and equipment, military weapons. There's nobody even close, and that's acknowledged. All over the world, they talk about the greatness of our military equipment. Nobody comes close. So when you buy and as you buy military equipment, hopefully, you'll be thinking only of the United States.\nWith the expanded trade and new infrastructure, we will unleash incredible energy innovation that is safe, responsible, and environmentally friendly. The United States supports a commonsense approach to protecting natural resources, one that responsibly balances economic growth, job creation, and energy security. We invite all countries to work with us to achieve this objective and to develop innovative technologies that empower nations around the world to be faithful stewards of their natural resources, while lifting millions out of poverty and into great and beautiful futures.\nThe Three Seas Initiative will not only empower your people to prosper, but it will ensure that your nations remain sovereign, secure, and free from foreign coercion. The Three Seas nations will stand stronger than they ever have stood before. When your nations are strong, all the free nations of Europe are stronger, and the West becomes stronger as well. Together, our Nation and yours can bring greater peace, prosperity, and safety to all of our people.\nThis summit ushers in the next great energy frontier. This is largely about energy, because we are that great exporter. We've just become—what's going on in our country is incredible, and I hope you take advantage of it by using these resources.\nI'm thrilled to join you today, and I want everyone to know that the United States supports your bold efforts. These projects will improve countless lives across the region and throughout the world. America will be your strongest ally and steadfast partner in this truly historic initiative.\nSo congratulations to everybody. And we stand ready, willing, and able to help with your energy needs and other needs as they come along.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-07-06", "title": "Remarks at the Three Seas Initiative Summit in Warsaw, Poland"}

That was very nice.\nWe've come to your nation to deliver a very important message: America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people. Thank you. The Poles have not only greatly enriched this region, but Polish Americans have also greatly enriched the United States, and I was truly proud to have their support in the 2016 election.\nIt is a profound honor to stand in this city by this monument to the Warsaw Uprising and to address the Polish nation that so many generations have dreamed of: a Poland that is safe, strong, and free.\nPresident Duda and your wonderful First Lady, Agata, have welcomed us with the tremendous warmth and kindness for which Poland is known around the world.

These soldiers are not only brave defenders of freedom, but also symbols of America's commitment to your security and your place in a strong and democratic Europe. We are proudly joined on stage by American, Polish, British, and Romanian soldiers. Thank you. Thank you. Great job.\nPresident Duda and I have just come from an incredibly successful meeting with the leaders participating in the Three Seas Initiative. To the citizens of this great region, America is eager to expand our partnership with you. We welcome stronger ties of trade and commerce as you grow your economies. And we are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy. Mr. President, I congratulate you, along with the President of Croatia, on your leadership of this historic Three Seas Initiative. Thank you.\nThis is my first visit to Central Europe as President, and I am thrilled that it could be right here at this magnificent, beautiful piece of land. It is beautiful. Poland is the geographic heart of Europe, but more importantly, in the Polish people, we see the soul of Europe. Your nation is great because your spirit is great and your spirit is strong.\nFor two centuries, Poland suffered constant and brutal attacks. But while Poland could be invaded and occupied, and its borders even erased from the map, it could never be erased from history or from your hearts. In those dark days, you have lost your land, but you never lost your pride. So it is with true admiration that I can say today, that from the farms and villages of your countryside to the cathedrals and squares of your great cities, Poland lives, Poland prospers, and Poland prevails. Despite every effort to transform you, oppress you, or destroy you, you endured and overcame. You are the proud nation of Copernicus—think of that—Chopin, Saint John Paul II. Poland is a land of great heroes. And you are a people who know the true value of what you defend.\nThe triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope for a future in which good conquers evil and peace achieves victory over war. For Americans, Poland has been a symbol of hope since the beginning of our Nation. Polish heroes and American patriots fought side by side in our War of Independence and in many wars that followed. Our soldiers still serve together today in Afghanistan and Iraq, combating the enemies of all civilization.\nFor America's part, we have never given up on freedom and independence as the right and destiny of the Polish people, and we never, ever will. Our two countries share a special bond forged by unique histories and national characters. It's a fellowship that exists only among people who have fought and bled and died for freedom.\nThe signs of this friendship stand in our Nation's Capital. Just steps from the White House, we've raised statues of men with names like Pułaski and Kościuszko. The same is true in Warsaw, where street signs carry the name of George Washington and a monument stands to one of the world's greatest heroes, Ronald Reagan.\nAnd so I am here today not just to visit an old ally, but to hold it up as an example for others who seek freedom and who wish to summon the courage and the will to defend our civilization. The story of Poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never, ever forgotten who they are.\nAudience members. Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nPresident Trump. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Such a great honor. This is a nation more than 1,000 years old. Your borders were erased for more than a century and only restored just one century ago.\nIn 1920, in the Miracle of Vistula, Poland stopped the Soviet army bent on European conquest. Then, 19 years later in 1939, you were invaded yet again, this time by Nazi Germany from the west and the Soviet Union from the east. That's trouble. That's tough.\nUnder a double occupation the Polish people endured evils beyond description: the Katyn forest massacre, the occupations, the Holocaust, the Warsaw Ghetto and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the destruction of this beautiful capital city, and the deaths of nearly one in five Polish people. A vibrant Jewish population—the largest in Europe—was reduced to almost nothing after the Nazis systematically murdered millions of Poland's Jewish citizens, along with countless others, during that brutal occupation.\nIn the summer of 1944, the Nazi and Soviet armies were preparing for a terrible and bloody battle right here in Warsaw. Amid that hell on earth, the citizens of Poland rose up to defend their homeland. I am deeply honored to be joined on stage today by veterans and heroes of the Warsaw Uprising.\nAudience members. [Inaudible]\nPresident Trump. What great spirit. We salute your noble sacrifice, and we pledge to always remember your fight for Poland and for freedom. Thank you. Thank you. This monument reminds us that more than 150,000 Poles died during that desperate struggle to overthrow oppression.\nFrom the other side of the river, the Soviet armed forces stopped and waited. They watched at—as the Nazis ruthlessly destroyed the city, viciously murdering men, women, and children. They tried to destroy this nation forever by shattering its will to survive. But there is a courage and a strength deep in the Polish character that no one could destroy. The Polish martyr, Bishop Michael Kozal, said it well: \"More horrifying than a defeat of arms is a collapse of the human spirit.\"\nThrough four decades of communist rule, Poland and the other captive nations of Europe endured a brutal campaign to demolish freedom, your faith, your laws, your history, your identity—indeed the very essence of your culture and your humanity. Yet, through it all, you never lost that spirit. Your oppressors tried to break you, but Poland could not be broken.\nAnd when the day came on June 2, 1979, and 1 million Poles gathered around Victory Square for their very first mass with their Polish Pope, that day, every Communist in Warsaw must have known that their oppressive system would soon come crashing down. They must have known it at the exact moment during Pope John Paul II's sermon when a million Polish men, women, and children suddenly raised their voices in a single prayer. A million Polish people did not ask for wealth. They did not ask for privilege. Instead, 1 million Poles sang three simple words: \"We want God.\"\nIn those words, the Polish people recalled the promise of a better future. They found new courage to face down their oppressors, and they found the words to declare that Poland would be Poland once again.\nAs I stand here today before this incredible crowd, this faithful nation, we can still hear those voices that echo through history. Their message is as true today as ever. The people of Poland, the people of America, and the people of Europe still cry out \"We want God.\"\nTogether, with Pope John Paul II, the Poles reasserted their identity as a nation devoted to God. And with that powerful declaration of who you are, you came to understand what to do and how to live. You stood in solidarity against oppression, against a lawless secret police, against a cruel and wicked system that impoverished your cities and your souls. And you won. Poland prevailed. Poland will always prevail.\nAudience members. Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nPresident Trump. Thank you. You were supported in that victory over communism by a strong alliance of free nations in the West that defied tyranny. Now among the most committed members of the NATO alliance, Poland has resumed its place as a leading nation of a Europe that is strong, whole, and free.\nA strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe, and they know that. A strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world. One hundred years after the entry of American forces into World War I, the transatlantic bond between the United States and Europe is as strong as ever and maybe, in many ways, even stronger.\nThis continent no longer confronts the specter of communism. But today, we're in the West, and we have to say, there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life. You see what's happening out there. They are threats. We will confront them. We will win. But they are threats.\nAudience members. Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nPresident Trump. We are confronted by another oppressive ideology, one that seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe. America and Europe have suffered one terror attack after another. We're going to get it to stop. During a historic gathering in Saudi Arabia, I called on the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations to join together to drive out this menace which threatens all of humanity. We must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of their territory and their funding and their networks and any form of ideological support that they may have. While we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind.\nAudience members. Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nPresident Trump. We are fighting hard against radical Islamic terrorism, and we will prevail. We cannot accept those who reject our values and who use hatred to justify violence against the innocent.\nToday, the West is also confronted by the powers that seek to test our will, undermine our confidence, and challenge our interests. To meet new forms of aggression, including propaganda, financial crimes, and cyberwarfare, we must adapt our alliance to compete effectively in new ways and on all new battlefields.\nWe urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes—including Syria and Iran—and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself.\nFinally, on both sides of the Atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger, one firmly within our control. This danger is invisible to some, but familiar to the Poles: the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people. The West became great not because of paperwork and regulations, but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.\nAmericans, Poles, and nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty. We must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the south or the east, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith, and tradition that make us who we are. If left unchecked, these forces will undermine our courage, sap our spirit, and weaken our will to defend ourselves and our societies.\nBut just as our adversaries and enemies of the past learned here in Poland, we know that these forces, too, are doomed to fail if we want them to fail. And we do, indeed, want them to fail. They are doomed not only because our alliance is strong, our countries are resilient, and our power is unmatched. Through all of that, you have to say, everything is true. Our adversaries, however, are doomed because we will never forget who we are. And if we don't forget who are, we just can't be beaten. Americans will never forget. The nations of Europe will never forget. We are the fastest and the greatest community. There is nothing like our community of nations. The world has never known anything like our community of nations.\nWe write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover brandnew frontiers.\nWe reward brilliance. We strive for excellence and cherish inspiring works of art that honor God. We treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech and free expression. We empower women as pillars of our society and of our success. We put faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, at the center of our lives. And we debate everything. We challenge everything. We seek to know everything so that we can better know ourselves.\nAnd above all, we value the dignity of every human life, protect the rights of every person, and share the hope of every soul to live in freedom. That is who we are. Those are the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization.\nWhat we have, what we inherited from our—and you know this better than anybody, and you see it today with this incredible group of people—what we've inherited from our ancestors has never existed to this extent before. And if we fail to preserve it, it will never, ever exist again. So we cannot fail.\nThis great community of nations has something else in common: In every one of them, it is the people, not the powerful, who have always formed the foundation of freedom and the cornerstone of our defense. The people have been that foundation here in Poland—as they were right here in Warsaw—and they were the foundation from the very, very beginning in America.\nOur citizens did not win freedom together, did not survive horrors together, did not face down evil together, only to lose our freedom to a lack of pride and confidence in our values. We did not, and we will not. We will never back down.\nAudience members. Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nPresident Trump. As long as we know our history, we will know how to build our future. Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign, and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests. That is why my administration has demanded that all members of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligations.\nAs a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO. In fact, people are shocked. But billions and billions of dollars more are coming in from countries that, in my opinion, would not have been paying so quickly.\nTo those who would criticize our tough stance, I would point out that the United States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind article 5, the mutual defense commitment. Words are easy, but actions are what matters. And for its own protection, Europe—and you know this, everybody knows this, everybody has to know this—Europe must do more. Europe must demonstrate that it believes in its future by investing its money to secure that future.\nThat is why we applaud Poland for its decision to move forward this week on acquiring from the United States the battle-tested Patriot air and missile defense system, the best anywhere in the world. That is also why we salute the Polish people for being one of the NATO countries that has actually achieved the benchmark for investment in our common defense. Thank you. Thank you, Poland. I must tell you, the example you set is truly magnificent, and we applaud Poland. Thank you.\nWe have to remember that our defense is not just a commitment of money, it is a commitment of will. Because as the Polish experience reminds us, the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means, but also on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have. The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\nWe can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on Earth, but if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak, and we will not survive. If anyone forgets the critical importance of these things, let them come to one country that never has. Let them come to Poland. And let them come here, to Warsaw, and learn the story of the Warsaw Uprising.\nWhen they do, they should learn about Jerusalem Avenue. In August of 1944, Jerusalem Avenue was one of the main roads running east and west through this city, just as it is today. Control of that road was crucially important to both sides in the battle for Warsaw. The German military wanted it as their most direct route to move troops and to form a very strong front. And for the Polish Home Army, the ability to pass north and south across that street was critical to keep the center of the city and the Uprising itself from being split apart and destroyed.\nEvery night, the Poles put up sandbags amid machine gun fire—and it was horrendous fire—to protect a narrow passage across Jerusalem Avenue. Every day, the enemy forces knocked them down again and again and again. Then, the Poles dug a trench. Finally, they built a barricade. And the brave Polish fighters began to flow across Jerusalem Avenue. That narrow passageway, just a few feet wide, was the fragile link that kept the Uprising alive.\nBetween its walls, a constant stream of citizens and freedom fighters made their perilous, just perilous, sprints. They ran across that street, they ran through that street, they ran under that street, all to defend this city. \"The far side was several yards away,\" recalled one young Polish woman named Greta. That mortality and that life was so important to her. In fact, she said, \"The mortally dangerous sector of the street was soaked in blood. It was the blood of messengers, liaison girls, and couriers.\"\nNazi snipers shot at anybody who crossed. Anybody who crossed, they were being shot at. Their soldiers burned every building on the street, and they used the Poles as human shields for their tanks in their effort to capture Jerusalem Avenue. The enemy never ceased its relentless assault on that small outpost of civilization. And the Poles never ceased its defense.\nThe Jerusalem Avenue passage required constant protection, repair, and reinforcement, but the will of its defenders did not waver, even in the face of death. And to the last days of the Uprising, the fragile crossing never, ever failed. It was never, ever forgotten. It was kept open by the Polish people.\nThe memories of those who perished in the Warsaw Uprising cry out across the decades, and few are clearer than the memories of those who died to build and defend the Jerusalem Avenue crossing. Those heroes remind us that the West was saved with the blood of patriots, that each generation must rise up and play their part in its defense, and that every foot of ground and every last inch of civilization is worth defending with your life.\nOur own fight for the West does not begin on the battlefield, it begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls. Today, the ties that unite our civilization are no less vital, and demand no less defense, than that bare shred of land on which the hope of Poland once totally rested. Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory. And today, as ever, Poland is in our heart, and its people are in that fight. Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.\nAudience members. Donald Trump! Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nPresident Trump. Thank you. So, together, let us all fight like the Poles: for family, for freedom, for country, and for God.\nThank you. God bless you, God bless the Polish people, God bless our allies, and God bless the United States of America.\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-07-06", "title": "Remarks in Warsaw, Poland"}

On July 6, 1936, the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce established the United States air traffic control system. Since then, our Nation has enjoyed remarkable growth in safe air travel thanks to the dedication and unmatched skill of our technicians, engineers, and air traffic controllers.\nOur Nation's aviation professionals help guide millions of planes through one of the world's most complex and voluminous airspaces each year. Unfortunately, air traffic controllers still lack access to the most advanced equipment available. We must do better to equip our air traffic controllers and meet the needs of our growing system of air travel.\nTo this end, I recently announced new principles to modernize air travel and transform our air traffic control services into an independent, non-profit organization. My initiative will bring America in line with the rest of the industrialized world and ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration focuses on what it does best—making our skies safe. These much-needed reforms will lead to accelerated innovation, fewer flight delays and cancellations, and more direct flights to more destinations.\nSince President Ronald Reagan first marked National Air Traffic Control Day more than 30 years ago, technology has reshaped all aspects of American life.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126608", "text": "Hamburg Messe\n7:18 P.M. CET\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Hi, everybody. I just want to highlight very briefly, and then Secretary Tillerson will go on, and then afterwards we'll both answer a few questions.\nBut President Trump has had a very, very significant few days. I think, as you know, we went to Poland on Wednesday. In Poland, he met with 12 different leaders. We had bilats with Croatia and with Poland, as well as 10 other leaders at the Three Seas Conference where we talked about energy -- the importance of the energy markets, the importance of supplying independent energy, infrastructure and opportunities there. I think, as you know, the speech which was just incredibly well-received, is part of our \"America First But America Not Alone.\"\nThen coming here, the President has had very significant meetings at the G20 already. Yesterday, we had the opportunity to meet with Chancellor Merkel and her team. It was a very, very productive and friendly meeting. There were lots of areas for us to collaborate on that were very clear. We talked about economic issues, we talked about trade. We had a very productive dinner last night -- Secretary Tillerson, myself, General McMaster -- with President Moon Jae-in and Prime Minister Abe and their teams, discussing the importance of what's going on in North Korea and the issues there. And then today we've had, already, several other bilats, and tomorrow we have another six.\nThe President also participated in a very important session today on trade and an important session on the environment and the economy. So I would just generally say we've had very productive economic meetings. There's been very substantive issues discussed. The North Korea issue has been discussed very significantly, about the escalation in North Korea.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Secretary Tillerson to talk about his meetings, and afterwards we'll take some questions.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Thank you, Steve, and thanks for staying with us late these evening.\nPresident Trump and President Putin met this afternoon for 2 hours and 15 minutes here on the sidelines of the G20. The two leaders exchanged views on the current nature of the U.S.-Russia relationship and the future of the U.S.-Russia relationship.\nThey discussed important progress that was made in Syria, and I think all of you have seen some of the news that just broke regarding a de-escalation agreement and memorandum, which was agreed between the United States, Russia and Jordan, for an important area in southwest Syria that affects Jordan's security, but also is a very complicated part of the Syrian battlefield.\nThis de-escalation area was agreed, it's well-defined, agreements on who will secure this area. A ceasefire has been entered into. And I think this is our first indication of the U.S. and Russia being able to work together in Syria. And as a result of that, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria that we can continue to work together on to de-escalate the areas and violence once we defeat ISIS, and to work together toward a political process that will secure the future of the Syrian people.\nAs a result, at the request of President Putin, the United States has appointed -- and you've seen, I think, the announcement of Special Representative for Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker. Ambassador Volker will draw on his decades of experience in the U.S. Diplomatic Corps, both as a representative to NATO and also his time as a permanent political appointment.\nThe two leaders also acknowledged the challenges of cyber threats and interference in the democratic processes of the United States and other countries, and agreed to explore creating a framework around which the two countries can work together to better understand how to deal with these cyber threats, both in terms of how these tools are used to in interfere with the internal affairs of countries, but also how these tools are used to threaten infrastructure, how these tools are used from a terrorism standpoint as well.\nThe President opened the meeting with President Putin by raising the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. They had a very robust and lengthy exchange on the subject. The President pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement. President Putin denied such involvement, as I think he has in the past.\nThe two leaders agreed, though, that this is a substantial hindrance in the ability of us to move the Russian-U.S. relationship forward, and agreed to exchange further work regarding commitments of non-interference in the affairs of the United States and our democratic process as well as those of other countries. So more work to be done on that regard.\nI'd be happy to take your questions. You're going to referee, Sean?\nQ: Mr. Secretary, Nick Waters (ph) from Bloomberg News. Can you tell us whether President Trump said whether there would be any consequences for Russia to the interference in the U.S. election? Did he spell out any specific consequences that Russia would face? And then also, on the Syria ceasefire, when does it begin? And what makes you think the ceasefire will succeed this time when past U.S.-Russian agreements on a ceasefire have failed?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: With regard to the interference in the election, I think the President took note of actions that have been discussed by the Congress. Most recently, additional sanctions that have been voted out of the Senate to make it clear as to the seriousness of the issue. But I think what the two Presidents, I think rightly, focused on is how do we move forward; how do we move forward from here. Because it's not clear to me that we will ever come to some agreed-upon resolution of that question between the two nations.\nSo the question is, what do we do now? And I think the relationship -- and the President made this clear, as well -- is too important, and it's too important to not find a way to move forward -- not dismissing the issue in any way, and I don't want to leave you with that impression. And that is why we've agreed to continue engagement and discussion around how do we secure a commitment that the Russian government has no intention of and will not interfere in our affairs in the future, nor the affairs of others, and how do we create a framework in which we have some capability to judge what is happening in the cyber world and who to hold accountable. And this is obviously an issue that's broader than just U.S.-Russia, but certainly we see the manifestation of that threat in the events of last year.\nAnd so I think, again, the Presidents rightly focused on how do we move forward from what may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point.\nAs to the Syria ceasefire, I would say what may be different this time, I think, is the level of commitment on the part of the Russian government. They see the situation in Syria transitioning from the defeat of ISIS, which we are progressing rapidly, as you know. And this is what really has led to this discussion with them as to what do we do to stabilize Syria once the war against ISIS is won.\nAnd Russia has the same, I think, interest that we do in having Syria become a stable place, a unified place, but ultimately a place where we can facilitate a political discussion about their future, including the future leadership of Syria.\nSo I think part of why we're -- and again, we'll see what happens as to the ability to hold the ceasefire. But I think part of what's different is where we are relative to the whole war against ISIS, where we are in terms of the opposition's, I think, position as to their strength within the country, and the regime itself.\nIn many respects, people are getting tired. They're getting weary of the conflict. And I think we have an opportunity, we hope, to create the conditions in this area, and the south is I think our first show of success. We're hoping we can replicate that elsewhere.\nMR. SPICER: Abby.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you spoke, when you were speaking of the ceasefire, about they're being detailed information about who would enforce it. Can you give any more information on what conclusions were reached? And you spoke of the future leadership of Syria. Do you still believe that Assad has no role in their government?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: I would like to defer on the specific roles in particular of security forces on the ground, because there is -- there are a couple of more meetings to occur. This agreement, I think as you're aware, was entered into between Jordan, the United States, and Russia. And we are -- we have a very clear picture of who will provide the security forces, but we have a few more details to work out. And if I could, I'd like to defer on that until that is completed.\nI expect that will be completed within the next -- less than a week. The talks are very active and ongoing.\nAnd your second question again?\nQ: Does the administration still believe that Assad has no role in the future government of Syria?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Yes, our position continues to be that we see no long-term role for the Assad family or the Assad regime. And we have made this clear to everyone -- we've certainly made it clear in our discussions with Russia -- that we do not think Syria can achieve international recognition in the future. Even if they work through a successful political process, the international community simply is not going to accept a Syria led by the Assad regime.\nAnd so if Syria is to be accepted and have a secure -- both a secure and economic future, it really requires that they find new leadership. We think it will be difficult for them to attract both the humanitarian aid, as well as the reconstruction assistance that's going to be required, because there just will be such a low level of confidence in the Assad government. So that continues to be the view.\nAnd as we've said, how Assad leaves is yet to be determined, but our view is that somewhere in that political process there will be a transition away from the Assad family.\nQ: Thank you. Demetri Sevastopulo, Financial Times. On North Korea, did President Putin agree to do anything to help the U.S. to put more pressure on North Korea? And secondly, you seem to have reached somewhat of an impasse with China in terms of getting them to put more pressure on North Korea. How are you going to get them to go beyond what they've done already? And what is President Trump going to say to President Xi on that issue tomorrow?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: We did have a pretty good exchange on North Korea. I would say the Russians see it a little differently than we do, so we're going to continue those discussions and ask them to do more.\nRussia does have economic activity with North Korea, but I would also hasten to add Russia's official policy is the same as ours -- a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\nAnd so I think here, again, there is a difference in terms of view around tactics and pace, and so we will continue to work with them to see if we cannot persuade them as to the urgency that we see.\nI think with respect to China, what our experience with China has been -- and I've said this to others -- it's been a bit uneven. China has taken significant action, and then I think for a lot of different reasons, they paused and didn't take additional action. They then have taken some steps, and then they paused. And I think in our own view there are a lot of, perhaps, explanations for why those pauses occur. But we've remained very closely engaged with China, both through our dialogues that have occurred face-to-face, but also on the telephone. We speak very frequently with them about the situation in North Korea.\nSo there's a clear understanding between the two of us of our intent. And I think the sanctions action that was taken here just in last week to 10 days certainly got their attention in terms of their understanding our resolve to bring more pressure to bear on North Korea by directly going after entities doing business with North Korea, regardless of where they may be located. We've continued to make that clear to China that we would prefer they take the action themselves. And we're still calling upon them to do that.\nSo I would say our engagement is unchanged with China, and our expectations are unchanged.\nQ: And you haven't given up hope?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: No, we have not given up hope. When you're in an approach like we're using -- and I call it the peaceful pressure campaign. A lot of people like to characterize it otherwise, but this is a campaign to lead us to a peaceful resolution. Because if this fails, we don't have very many good options left. And so it is a peaceful pressure campaign, and it's one that requires calculated increases in pressure, allow the regime to respond to that pressure. And it takes a little time to let these things happen. You enact the pressure; it takes a little while for that to work its way through.\nSo it is going to require some level of patience as we move this along, but when we talk about our strategic patience ending, what we mean is we're not going to just sit idly by, and we're going to follow this all the way to its conclusion.\nQ: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, I have issue -- you just mentioned on the DPRK. We note China and Russia recently said -- they asked North Korea to stop the -- to freeze, actually, the nuclear activities, and also they asked the U.S. to stop the deployment of THAAD system. So did President Putin bring up his concern about the deployment of THAAD system? And also, what's the expectation of President Trump on tomorrow's meeting with President Xi Jinping, other than the DPRK issue? Thank you.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: The subject of THAAD did not come up in the meeting with President Putin.\nIn terms of the progress of North Korea and this last missile launch, again, those are some of the differences of views we have between ourselves in terms of tactics -- how to deal with this. President Putin, I think, has expressed a view not unlike that of China, that they would support a freeze for freeze.\nIf we study the history of the last 25 years of engagement with various regimes in North Korea, this has been done before. And every time it was done, North Korea went ahead and proceeded with its program.\nThe problem with freezing now -- if we freeze where they are today, we freeze their activities with a very high level of capability. And we do not think it also sets the right tone for where these talks should begin. And so we're asking North Korea to be prepared to come to the table with an understanding that these talks are going to be about how do we help you chart a course to cease and roll back your nuclear program? That's what we want to talk about. We're not interested in talking about how do we have you stop where you are today. Because stopping where they are today is not acceptable to us.\nMR. SPICER: Margaret.\nQ: Margaret Talev with Bloomberg. Mr. Secretary, could you give us a roadmap? Did you agree on a next set of talks between the President and Mr. Putin? And I guess I have kind of like a fluffy, color question on general impressions. We thought this was a 30-minute meeting. It ended up being 2 hours and 16 minutes. That's a lot of time to watch those two leaders interact and also to just -- whatever. Any insights on all those? Also, real quickly, any update on the dachas? Are they getting them back? And on Ukraine sanctions, any resolution or progress on those? Thanks.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Okay, so the first question?\nQ: Next talks.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Next talks. There's no agreed next meeting between the Presidents. There are agreed subsequent follow-up meetings between various working-level groups at the State Department. We agreed to set up a working-level group to begin to explore this framework agreement around the cyber issue and this issue of non-interference. So those will be ongoing with various staff levels.\nQ: Who's leading that? Is that Rob Joyce on the U.S. side?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, it will be out of the State Department and --\nQ: State.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: And the national security advisor's office.\nAs to the nature of the 2 hours and 15 minutes, first let me characterize -- the meeting was very constructive. The two leaders, I would say, connected very quickly. There was a very clear positive chemistry between the two. I think, again -- and I think the positive thing I observed -- and I've had many, many meetings with President Putin before -- is there was not a lot of re-litigating of the past. I think both of the leaders feel like there's a lot of things in the past that both of us are unhappy about. We're unhappy, they're unhappy.\nI think the perspective of both of them was, this is a really important relationship. Two largest nuclear powers in the world. It's a really important relationship. How do we start making this work? How do we live with one another? How do we work with one another? We simply have to find a way to go forward. And I think that was -- that was expressed over and over, multiple times, I think by both Presidents, this strong desire.\nIt is a very complicated relationship today because there are so many issues on the table. And one of the reasons it took a long time, I think, is because once they met and got acquainted with one another fairly quickly, there was so much to talk about -- all these issues. Just about everything got touched on to one degree or another. And I think there was just such a level of engagement and exchange, and neither one of them wanted to stop. Several times I had to remind the President, and people were sticking their heads in the door. And I think they even -- they sent in the First Lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn't work either. (Laughter.)\nQ: Is that true?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: But -- yes, it's true. But it was --\nQ: What was the timetable?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, we went another hour after she came in to see us. (Laughter.) So clearly she failed.\nBut I think -- what I've described to you, the 2 hours and 15 minutes, it was an extraordinarily important meeting. I mean, there's just -- there's so much for us to talk about. And it was a good start. Now, I will tell you we spent a very, very lengthy period on Syria, with a great amount of detailed exchange on the agreement we had concluded today -- it was announced -- but also where we go, and trying to get much greater clarity around how we see this playing out and how Russia sees it playing out, and where do we share a common view and where do we have a difference, and do we have the same objectives in mind.\nAnd I would tell you that, by and large, our objectives are exactly the same. How we get there, we each have a view. But there's a lot more commonality to that than there are differences. So we want to build on the commonality, and we spent a lot of time talking about next steps. And then where there's differences, we have more work to get together and understand. Maybe they've got the right approach and we've got the wrong approach.\nSo there was a substantial amount of time spent on Syria, just because we've had so much activity going on with it.\nMR. SPICER: Peter.\nQ: Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, can you say if the President was unequivocal in his view that Russia did interfere in the election? Did he offer to produce any evidence or to convince Mr. Putin?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: The Russians have asked for proof and evidence. I'll leave that to the intelligence community to address the answer to that question. And again, I think the President, at this point, he pressed him and then felt like at this point let's talk about how do we go forward. And I think that was the right place to spend our time, rather than spending a lot of time having a disagreement that everybody knows we have a disagreement.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, guys, very much. Have a great evening.\nEND 7:41 P.M.

For more than two centuries, those three beautiful words have been the world standard for quality, craftsmanship, and excellence, and they still are today.\nAs President, one of my highest priorities is to restore American manufacturing. For decades, American jobs have been ripped out of our communities, industries and towns have been stripped bare, and the entire communities have been uprooted and left. Foreign nations got rich at America's expense, and many special interests profited from this great global theft of American wealth.\nSince taking the oath of office, our Government has adopted a new philosophy: America first. And believe me, it's about time. The era of economic surrender is over, and a new national pride is sweeping across our land. You see it, I see it, we all see it.\nIndustry confidence has soared to the highest level ever recorded. One of my first acts was ordering all Federal agencies to enforce two simple rules: buy American, and hire American. We want to build with American workers and with American iron, aluminum, and steel.\nWe are also tearing down every possible barrier to domestic energy production to unleash the full power of our economy. The American people will finally be allowed to tap into the vast energy wealth sitting right beneath our feet or right below our shores.\nWe have also sent a clear message to the world that we will not allow other nations to take advantage of us any longer. That's why I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord—and believe me, it was one-sided, not a good deal for our country—and the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And that's why we are pursuing a total renegotiation of NAFTA, and if we don't get it, we will terminate—that is, end—NAFTA forever.\nEvery other nation on earth protects its own interests. America is finally going to do the same. And as we continue to fight for American workers and industry, it won't be long before we see the \"Made in America\" label proudly displayed on thousands of new products all across this great land and exported all around the world.\nThank you, God bless you, God bless America. We are all doing a job; we are working very hard. It will be America first. It will be \"make America great again.\" It's happening.", "timestamp": "2017-07-07", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Trump, President Moon Jae-in, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met in Hamburg, Germany, on July 6 to discuss the serious and escalating threat posed by the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The three leaders condemned the DPRK's unprecedented launch, on July 4, of a ballistic missile with intercontinental range, a major escalation that directly violates multiple United Nation's Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and that clearly demonstrates the growing threat the DPRK poses to the United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Japan, as well as other countries around the world. The leaders affirmed the importance of working together to counter the DPRK threat and to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner, a shared goal among the three countries. They also committed to continue to cooperate to apply maximum pressure on the DPRK to change its path, refrain from provocative and threatening actions, and take steps necessary to return to serious denuclearization dialogue. The three leaders emphasized that they, together with the rest of the international community, stand ready to offer a brighter future for the DPRK if it chooses the right path. The United States, the ROK, and Japan will never accept a nuclear armed DPRK.\nPresident Trump, President Moon, and Prime Minister Abe decided to press for the early adoption of a new UNSC resolution with additional sanctions to demonstrate to the DPRK that there are serious consequences for its destabilizing, provocative, and escalatory actions. They called on the international community to swiftly and fully implement all UNSC resolutions and to take measures to reduce economic relations with the DPRK. The three leaders also called on the nations that border the DPRK to make further efforts to convince the DPRK regime to abandon its current threatening and provocative path and immediately take steps to denuclearize and to halt its ballistic missile program.\nThe three leaders underscored their commitment to further strengthen their respective alliances and to ensure they continue to increase their capabilities to deter and respond to any attack from the DPRK. They committed to continue advancing trilateral security cooperation in the face of the threat posed by the DPRK. President Trump reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to defend the ROK and Japan using the full range of its conventional and nuclear capabilities.", "timestamp": "2017-07-07", "title": "Joint Statement by President Trump, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126629", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Joint Base Andrews\n7:00 P.M. CET\nMR. COHN: So we're going to divide up the labors here.\nQ: Just for the purpose of people back home, can you say your name before your speak?\nMR. COHN: Okay, sure. I'm Gary Cohn. Secretary Mnuchin and General McMaster, we're going to be diving up the duties here. I'm going to be talking about the G20 in itself. General McMaster and Secretary Mnuchin will be talking about all of the bilaterals and all of the meetings with heads of state that we had over the last three days, including going back into Poland and the Three Seas meetings as well. So if you add them all up, probably 20 individual meetings with different countries over the last three days on the trip.\nI'll first touch quickly on the G20. I think as you know, we had a very rigorous schedule for the President, and he made it more rigorous on himself by adding a few more extra meetings, which the Secretary will touch on.\nThe G20 schedule, as you know, that we went through in the prior press conference, talked on some of the major topics that we were quite interested in. The President took the opportunity to deliver speeches in each of the sections. The first section was the private leaders section on terrorism, where the President delivered his thoughts on terrorism, global terrorism, what's going on in terrorism around the world, and terrorism financing.\nThe Secretary would be happy to talk to you about what he's doing on fighting terrorism and terrorism financing and sanctions. We've become more aggressive on what we're doing there and trying to cut off funding to terrorism around the world. The global leaders as a whole were in consensus, in uniform thoughts on what's going on in the fight of terrorism around the world.\nThe second section, where the President also led off and spoke and delivered a speech on trade and finance. The President talked about what's going on in the U.S. economy; talked about the job creation, the job data out on Friday; talked about the 860,000-plus jobs since the inauguration; and talked about the stock market reforms and what's going on here, and how we're doing in the economy but how we've got to get our trade and our trade numbers better, and our trade imbalance, and how we've got deficits with most of the countries -- most of the countries around the table.\nHe talked about the trade deficit. He talked about nearly $800 billion of trade deficits and goods for the United States last year alone. He talked about how he wants to rectify that and how we're going to fight to level the playing field on trade and climate. So he delivered that speech to the group there.\nThen we had section on migration, where the President delivered another speech a little bit later in the queue -- we went later in the queue on migration -- where the President talked about our views on migration, where he was looking at how he thought the world should look at migration. We should not promote the downward spiral of migration. We don't want to see mass migration out of any country. We should see countries looking to build their own economies and keep their residence in their countries, and keep their citizens in their countries, and make their countries better places for their citizens. He does believe in migration, but migration for the right reasons, and did not want to see massive migration.\nToday, I think you know, we started the day off by him going to the -- let me get my speeches here so I can -- the launch of the women's entrepreneurial financial initiative with the World Bank, where he announced our $50 million contribution, where he was onstage with Ivanka talking about what we are doing with the World Bank. And Dina down here, as well, was heavily involved. She's hiding. So we and many other countries were on the stage talking about the $300 million-plus contribution of the World Bank fund that they're going to leverage into billions of dollars to help women and women entrepreneurs, and women build businesses around the world. So that was the first thing we did this morning.\nAnd then, of course, that led into the G20 forum on digitization and women's empowerment and women's employment. Again, the President gave a speech in there where we talked about the role of women in the world. We talked about the role of women in the economies and empowering women, where, again, he mentioned what we did this morning. He mentioned how his administration cares about women, empower women as a priority, including access to capital, mentoring and networking, and skills training, which fits into what we did a couple weeks ago in our employment week. We talked about worker training and all of those things.\nSo he continues to support the G20's effort to increase voluntary participation of women in the labor force and eliminate barriers that prevent women from achieving economic aspirations. That was his speech this morning that we talked about in women's empowerment.\nAnd then, later this afternoon, we talked about what was going on in the final session, which I'm drawing a blank on right now. What was the final session this afternoon?\nMS. POWELL: The women's session -- the women one. That was the final session. It was the final one.\nMR. COHN: Yeah, that was the final. Okay, women was the final session. Then we had our closing session where there was the natural handoff from Germany to Argentina for the next year's G20. The President was quite active, quite involved in the roundtable discussions. He was very, very complimentary of Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, in the way that she ran the G20 and the participation of everyone around the table.\nIf you have any questions on the G20, I'm happy to take them. If not, my two colleagues to the right will talk about the bilateral meetings.\nQ: Can I ask, how hard did you have to work to get the final communiquй to make sure that you didn't look like you were too isolated on things like climate? And how much of a fig leaf is it that you've managed to get wording to that effect?\nMR. COHN: I actually thought the communication came together pretty -- I don't want to say easily -- these things are never easy. To get 20 of your friends to agree where to have dinner together tonight is really hard. But I thought the communiquй came together pretty reasonably. There's a diversity of opinions in a group of 20, so there's people on every side of the issue. So it was never a situation where there was an isolated force there.\nObviously, the communication says -- so you can see it in there -- that we had chosen to get out of the Paris Agreement. So we were -- but everyone accepted that very early that we chose to get out of the Paris Agreement, but we do go out of our way to say in there that that doesn't mean that we don't support environment, and we're still working for the environment. If you look at what we've achieved environmentally in the United States, our numbers are pretty good.\nSo there was not -- it was not a situation where there was contentious discussion going on.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I would just say on the communiquй and if you look at how far we've come since the original G20 finance ministers meeting where we had one sentence on trade -- and I think as you all know, it was kind of 19 to 1, me being the one -- here, I think the trade paragraph has enormous substance to it. It incorporates the concept of reciprocal and fair trade. And I think there was a real focus on dumping and other issues on steel. I think there was an incredible consensus, and now it's many months later.\nBut anyway, why don't I do this -- why don't I just talk briefly about the bilats and then we'll take questions on anything you guys want.\nSo this was the President's second trip abroad. I think that a major focus of the trip was not just participating in the G20, but was very substantive -- they were very, very substantive bilats. And Secretary Tillerson joined us on the trip, in Hamburg specifically, to participate in the bilats.\nI think as you know, we started in Poland with two bilats in Poland and then participating in the Three Seas with another 10 leaders. President Trump participated in that meeting, which was very substantive, and listened to each one of those leaders as they had different views.\nWe then came to Germany, where there were 10 -- there were another eight bilats here. There were three pull-asides on top of that. The bilats were very, very substantive discussions. These were not just relationship builders. These were very focused on economic issues, trade issues, security issues, North Korea.\nI think as you know, we had a very significant trilat dinner with Prime Minister Abe and President Moon, where the focus was clearly North Korea and what we were going to do about North Korea.\nThe other two most substantive bilats were obviously the Russian bilat with President Putin, which started out with the intention of being a half an hour, and went for over two hours. We had another very substantive bilat today with President Xi of China, which lasted over an hour and a half, and would have lasted longer if we didn't have to get pulled out to leave, since we had a time issue. But these were very substantive issues.\nIn regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation. And we had very direct discussions about the comprehensive economic dialogue, which we'll be following up with a meeting in July, in D.C. So these were very, very, substantive discussions.\nMR. COHN: Let me add something. The three of us have been in, I would say, basically all of the President's bilats since day one. The relationships that --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. COHN: What was it?\nQ: (Inaudible) one.\nMR. COHN: I said basically all. The relationships that he's building and the comradery that he has is just extraordinary. I mean, you can see the personal relationship he has with Xi and Abe and all these people. The warmness and the openness that's going on between the two of them, it's really extraordinary.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, and to what Andrew asked about --\nMR. MNUCHIN: (Inaudible) on Merkel, okay? Whatever original discussions there were, that was one of the most substantive meetings where it was very clear that the President addressed issues of trade very directly. Merkel was very direct. It could not have gone better. I think it was very clear we're on the same page on almost every issue. And whether it was Theresa May, where obviously it's the U.S.'s most substantial ally -- I mean, these were very substantive discussions where the President was brilliant and had a command of these discussions and the issues.\nQ: Can you talk specifically about the meeting with President Xi? In his public remarks, the President was complimentary of President Xi and what he's done on the issue of North Korea. But we know he has also said that he is frustrated that China hasn't done more. So did he voice that in private? Or can you characterize at all what their discussion was with regard to how to respond to the latest --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think the discussion was very direct. So it started with a -- again, this was an hour-and-a-half meeting with a very large component of it focused on North Korea. And I think we had substantive discussions about -- for the financing of North Korea. We had substantive discussions about ways of dealing with North Korea together.\nAnd I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint. So I think it was very predominantly about --\nQ: Did he ask (inaudible) --\nMR. SPICER: I'm want to get McMaster in here. Let's do\nthat, and then we can keep going.\nGeneral.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Okay. All right, first, I just wanted\nto remind everybody that the President's second overseas trip began in Poland, where he attended a Three Seas Conference with 12 heads of state from central and southern Europe. It was an extremely successful exchange of views and perspectives there. And you really got to see the three main objectives that the President gave us to structure this trip being met from the very beginning of the trip, which is promote American prosperity, protect American interests, and provide American leadership.\nAnd you saw the overlap between defense and security cooperation with energy security, and the role the United States can play in ensuring that those nations are not dependent on any one source of energy and are not then susceptible to the kind of coercion associated with that single source of energy.\nHe also saw how those nations really want American leadership -- really want America to be engaged in that part of the world. And what the President was able to do there, and in his meetings with President Duda and the Polish leadership, is really reaffirm America's leadership, commitment to our allies, and to NATO in particular.\nAnd the very powerful speech that he gave I think is a great example of the overlap between those three objectives of prosperity, protecting our interests, and providing American leadership.\nI think what is really important is I think you can see with the President's engagement is the advancing of American influence and leadership, and a recognition -- by us, by everyone -- that America First doesn't mean that the rest of the world last. America First doesn't mean America alone. And it means that peace, prosperity, and the rule of law are the surest guarantors of liberty, both at home and abroad. And that speech in Poland -- I would just ask you to go back to that text to see the overlap between those three objectives.\nThe President reiterated his commitment to mutual support and defense through NATO, and he gave a stirring affirmation of our values and why it's important for us to understand who we are, and to be determined to protect our values. He talked through the historical lens of the Polish experience to emphasize what we need to do today to defeat the enemies of all civilized people represented by these terrorist organizations that use a perverted interpretation of religion to foment hatred and justify violence.\nAnd throughout the trip, throughout his engagements with leaders -- as Secretary Mnuchin already mentioned -- the President emphasized the need to deny safe havens and support bases for terrorist organizations, and talked about ongoing operations with our allies and partners to do that in the defeat-ISIS campaign in places like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\nHe then also, though, emphasized again the need to cut off funding not only for terrorist organizations but also to those who propagate this extremist ideology that continues to fuel this problem and bring people into these organizations, and then, of course, to combat the ideology itself. And so that was a theme in almost all of the bilateral engagements as well as the beginning of the trip in Poland.\nYou have the list of all the bilateral engagements. We're happy to answer any questions you have. But I think what you saw is that America First means building coalitions -- building coalitions especially with those whose interests overlap with ours. And what you saw is really a high degree of common understanding of not just problems that we're facing, but also opportunities that we can take advantage of.\nAnd each of these meetings, each of these engagements with leaders advanced American interests in the areas of our security and American prosperity. And we can cover lots of specifics on that if you'd like as well.\nAnd then, of course, there's a recognition that the United States benefits when our allies and partners are stronger, and when burdens and responsibilities can be shared and shouldered more equitably.\nAnd so what you've seen is a very big emphasis on defense cooperation and a desire for us to have interoperable capabilities with our allies. And that was a big defense cooperation theme throughout all the engagements in Poland and in the G20 as well.\nQ: General McMaster, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov walked out of that bilat yesterday and went out, and they told people that President Trump had accepted their denial of election interference. Is that true?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me just say, first of all, I think President Trump handled the meeting brilliantly, okay? It was very clear what started as a 30-minute meeting -- and President Trump made it very clear in addressing the issues around the election. After a very substantive discussion on this, they reached an agreement that they would start a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cybersecurity together. And President Trump focused the conversation on Syria and the Ukraine and North Korea.\nAnd I think it's very important that President Trump had a very substantive dialogue with his counterpart on this. And it is very clear that there are many issues we need to open a dialogue on. And I think President Trump handled it brilliantly.\nQ: General McMaster, can you address not the question of how President Trump handled it, but the question of how Putin and Lavrov have handled it. What are you going to do about it? I mean, it's not true, is it, that President Trump accepted Putin's statement?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: What the President and Secretary Tillerson charged us with as they came out of the meeting is what we're going to do going forward. Secretary Mnuchin mentioned one of those aspects already, which is a recognition of the importance of cybersecurity and the need to make sure that we protect election systems in the United States and in Europe and elsewhere. So that is one of the things we're going to focus on going forward.\nBut I think the most important thing, from my perspective anyway, coming out of the meeting, is the importance of having a bilateral relationship with Russia so we can work on problems together. And so as Secretary Mnuchin mentioned, and as Secretary Tillerson mentioned already, it was a wide-ranging, substantive discussion. No problems were solved. Nobody expected any problems to be solved in that meeting. But it was a beginning of a dialogue on some tough problem sets that we'll begin now to work on together.\nAnd you saw the beginnings of that with the work that Secretary Tillerson has done with the Russians on Syria. It's the very beginning of attempting to get to some degree of stability in a portion of Syria to begin to get to an outcome there that ends the humanitarian suffering there and begins to bridge toward enduring political settlements in at least parts of that troubled country and for that long-suffering population.\nSo you see the beginning of working together in these areas.\nQ: But you have the President of another country making a statement about the President of the United States. Do you not want to respond to that and correct the record if it is wrong?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: You know, we're not going to make comments about what other people say. President Trump will be happy to make statements himself about that. But President Trump handled himself brilliantly. It was very clear he made his position felt. And after very substantive dialogue on this, they agreed to move on to other discussions. And I think it's very clear that they've opened a dialogue, that it's important to have a dialogue.\nAs we've said, they focused on a ceasefire on Syria, focused on making sure that we have a cyber unit to make sure that Russia and nobody else interferes in any democratic elections. And we focused on the issue of North Korea, which is a major concern to us and all our other allies.\nQ: Why did you decide to raise it anyway, though? There seemed to be a debate, sort of, in the days leading up to the meeting: \"Would he raise it? Would he not raise it?\" Why did he decide to sort of raise it at all? Was that essential, do you think, to start that dialogue? Or why did he decide --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think it was obvious that it was an issue, and President Trump was going to bring it up and raise it. He wasn't afraid of it. He addressed it head on, and then they moved on to other issues.\nQ: How do you develop an atmosphere of trust and working together on all these important issues that you just laid out when the two sides can't even agree on what happened in that conversation in the first face-to-face meeting? I mean --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think it's very clear that there's lots of things that we need to work on with them. And there's a commitment to move forward, work on issues that we can work on together. And I think the Syria ceasefire is a major, major success. If we can have a ceasefire and focus on how we work on Syria, and build a cyber unit, and be committed to make sure that nobody ever interferes in democratic elections again, that is a major accomplishment that President Trump is focused on.\nQ: Did the issue of Russia's properties in Maryland that the U.S. confiscated come up? And how did President Trump respond?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not aware of that coming up. I got debriefed on the meeting and didn't hear anything about that. So it may have, but I don't know.\nQ: One follow-up to Gary on the question of the G20 and climate change. We understand there was some tension with President Macron over climate. Can you describe what happened there? And can you also look forward to this upcoming trip to Paris and describe the relationship and what he wants to do there between Macron and Trump?\nMR. COHN: Look, there's a debate on climate -- from your question. But I think the President -- I'll read you two -- I think the section I left out before was climate. So I'll read you two sentences out of the President's speech.\nYou know, he says: The United States believes that responsible economic development and economic stewardship are essential priorities of all nations. Indeed, these are globally complementary. And then the President goes: Honestly, the United States develops all of our domestic energy resources, including oil, clean coal, natural gas, nuclear power renewables, while at the same time reducing emissions, protecting natural habitats, and ensuring truly clean air and clean water.\nSo the President clearly believes in the environment. He talked about it here. You know, Macron and the President have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same. And they were debating how to achieve the end goal.\nQ: And what about the broader relationship between those two men ahead of the Paris trip?\nMR. COHN: Their relationship is great. I mean, they had two different pull-asides. Macron personally called the President and invited him, and asked him to come to the 100th anniversary of Bastille Day next week. The President is going to Paris next week.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: It's Bastille Day and the 100th anniversary of the entry of American troops into World War I. Sorry, sir.\nMR. COHN: Thank you. Thank you, General. (Laughter.)\nQ: But what does he want to achieve on that trip?\nMR. COHN: We are scheduled already. The schedule is determined. We'll probably tell you guys what it is next week. But it's going to have a couple official meetings mostly around, I would say, security and military meetings, as well as a long bilateral between the two.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: All right. I think we're going to cut it off at this point.\nQ: No, don't cut it off.\nQ: No, that's not fair. Seriously, that's not very long.\nQ: What about Erdogan? What about the Erdogan meeting?\nMS.

Everybody loves him, and they love him for a reason. So congratulations on the job you're doing.\nAnd I want to thank also Chancellor Merkel for what she's done here. It's been really incredible the way things have been handled—and nothing is easy—but so professionally and without much interruption, despite quite a few people. And they seem to follow your G-20s around. But you have been amazing, and you have done a fantastic job. And thank you very much, Chancellor. Incredible.\nI'm truly glad and very proud to be here today to announce a historic initiative that will help transform millions of lives—millions and millions, a lot of great, great women out there with tremendous entrepreneurial spirit and talent—and really provide new hope to these women from countless communities all across the world. Women in both developing and developed countries represent tremendous promise for economic growth and prosperity.\nWhen more women participate in the workforce—which, by the way, will be a lot more competition for people like me, prior to becoming a politician. [Laughter] That's a lot of competition, talented competition. But the world economy will grow, and millions of people will be lifted out of poverty. Millions and millions of people, jobs.\nThe critical investments we're announcing today will help advance the economic empowerment of women around the world. As I said in Poland on Thursday—and Poland was so terrific to me and such great people—empowering women is a core value that binds us together.\nI'm very proud of my daughter Ivanka, always have been, from day one—I have to tell you that—from day one. She's always been great. A champion. She's a champion. If she weren't my daughter, it would be so much easier for her. [Laughter] It might be the only bad thing she has going, if you want to know the truth. [Laughter] But I'm very proud of Ivanka who has been a forceful advocate for landmark women entrepreneurs. And she worked very hard for the women entrepreneurs finance initiative.\nSo I want to thank you, Ivanka, for all of the great work you do in so many ways, in addition to the great work you've done over the last few weeks and months working so hard to help everybody. You're helping the Chancellor, but you're helping women all over the world. And I want to thank you. Thank you very much.\nI also want to thank World Bank President, my friend—well, Kim. [Laughter] Great guy, really a great guy. I might have even appointed him, but I didn't. [Laughter] He'd be a great appointment. And the founding donor countries for their generous support. We've had tremendous support from so many countries.\nChancellor Merkel and Ivanka, this is a vision that really has now become a reality, a very strongly funded reality. Thank you for all your efforts and your dedication to this very critical issue. And I love it because so many jobs; it's even beyond women—the women will be creating tremendous initiatives and businesses, and that means jobs for people.\nWe applaud everyone involved in this wonderful and meaningful project. And President Kim told me just recently that this is one of the most significant fundraising efforts for women entrepreneurs that has ever happened in history. And I think there's really nothing even close. So that's a great, that's a really great achievement.\nI'm pleased to announce today that our administration will also make a substantial contribution. And around the world, women face numerous barriers running their own businesses, including access to capital and, maybe almost as importantly, access to mentors. The facility will help remove these barriers and open up doors of opportunity so women may live and work to their full potential. And I know what that potential is: It's unlimited.\nBy investing in women around the world, we're investing in families, we're investing in prosperity, and we're investing in peace. With a $50 million commitment, the United States will continue to lead the world stage in developing policies to empower women financially in our modern economy.\nSo I just want to congratulate everybody. This has been a really difficult one. But once it got going, it was about women, and it just took off beyond what anybody thought.\nThank you. Thank you. Thank everybody here. And, Chancellor, thank you very much. Your leadership is absolutely incredible and very inspiring. Thank you very much, everybody.

Before we get started, I'd like to bring up Marc Short, the Director of Legislative Affairs, to give an update on how we're moving the President's agenda through Congress, particularly on the historic obstruction from Senate Democrats on confirming the President's incredibly qualified nominees to posts across the federal government.\nAfter his statement, Marc will take a few of your questions on that topic; and after that, I will be back to answer your other questions.\nThanks. Marc.\nMR. SHORT: Good afternoon. This week, the Senate has scheduled a few confirmation votes. Yet as even The Washington Post has reported, the Senate is conducting the slowest confirmation process in American history. For the past six months, Senator Schumer has deliberately run an unprecedented campaign of obstruction against the President's nominees for high-ranking positions in the government.\nNot only are key national security, energy, financial, and regulatory positions left unfilled, procedural slowdowns have kept the Senate committees from doing other legislative work.\nDemocrats even walked out of committee hearings to deny a quorum, like school children taking their toys from the playground. But it's the American people who are being hurt. These obstruction tactics are carried out in the name of resisting the Trump administration and playing to a radical left-wing base. But it's the will of the American people that is being denied.\nAs war rages in the Middle East, the Senate hasn't confirmed many national security appointees. In fact, the President's nominee for Under Secretary of Defense, Elaine McCusker, enjoyed bipartisan support as she advanced through committee. But she has now been waiting since May 23rd for a vote on the Senate floor.\nThe person responsible for ensuring our national security throughout all foreign investments is still waiting an up or down vote. Heath Tarbert was voted out of committee on May 23rd and for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has now waited for over a month for a confirmation vote.\nAs Americans are anxious to get back to work and get the economy growing again after eight years of stagflation -- sorry, stagnation, the nominee to run the President's Council of Economic Advisers is stuck waiting for approval. Kevin Hassett again received Democrat support and an endorsement letter from 44 bipartisan economists, some of whom even served in the Obama administration. He was approved in committee on June 14th and again is still waiting to be confirmed.\nThe list goes on. We currently have seven deputy secretaries -- to manage entire federal departments -- who have been cleared by committee and are waiting for a vote on the Senate floor.\nFolks, it's July 10th, and we do not have deputy secretaries at the Small Business Administration, the Department of Interior, the Department of Energy, HUD, HHS, OMB, and the Department of Defense. Senate committees have cleared 32 of our nominees who are still waiting for a floor vote.\nIn total, there are 133 nominees waiting for consideration by various committees. While Senator Schumer irresponsibly champions the resist movement, his partisan tactics are harming the country and obstructing the will of the American people.\nTo date, the Senate has confirmed a total of 50 Trump administration nominees. To put that in perspective, the Senate had confirmed 202 officials at this same point in the Obama administration. We think that that is a fair analogy because Republicans now control the Senate. Democrats controlled the Senate at that point. And the comparison is 50 to 202.\nBy the August recess in 2009, the Senate had confirmed 292 Obama administration nominees by voice vote alone. To date, the Trump administration nominees have received five voice vote confirmations.\nThe truth is the Democrats are putting their agenda ahead of the will of the American people. Democrats are keeping key agency nominees from serving their country. And today, we're calling on Senator Chuck Schumer to stop blocking the will of the American people for political gain. And we're also calling on you in the media to help shine light to bring this problem to light of day.\nThe Senate will likely devote this entire week to approving just three well-qualified nominees. We ask: Give these critical nominees an up or down vote so they can get to work.\nI'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Have you talked to the Democrats at all to find out why they're offering such pushback? And have you tried to negotiate with them behind the scenes to try and cure some of the problem? Or is it just here that we've heard about it?\nMR. SHORT: Yes, we have spoken to them. Yes, we've been trying to work that. I think that one comment that Democrats are likely to say is that, well, Republicans control the committees, and so they could move forward these committee assignments to the House floor quicker. But as we've already articulated to you, 32 of our nominees are sitting there waiting for floor votes now. The number of voice votes is small -- a fraction of what was afforded Obama nominees. And we think that there's really no historical precedent for this.\nQ: Just one quick follow-up then. What about those Democrats who are also saying this pales in comparison to what Senator McConnell said about the previous administration that goal one was to not pass anything that -- or help the administration out in way, shape, or form?\nMR. SHORT: I think that the record shows that what McConnell did as the Senate Republican leader at the time was to confirm Obama's nominees. I think there's a long history of believing the American people elect an administration. The committees determine the qualifications. And assuming that those candidates are qualified, they get votes. We're not receiving that courtesy.\nYes, Peter.\nQ: Marc, if can ask you, earlier today, we heard from some top U.S. senators, including Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Patty Murray and others that basically said in simple terms they want to advance policies that would help bring stability to health insurance markets and make premiums more affordable for millions of Americans, effectively calling for bipartisanship in the effort to deal with healthcare right now. Do you think bipartisanship -- given the fact about Democrats to work with Republicans on these nominees -- is bipartisanship the way to go to best serve Americans on healthcare?\nMR. SHORT: I think that we believe that bipartisanship is a solution to a lot of our problems. We have not seen bipartisanship. The numbers I'm giving you right now shows everything they're trying to do is obstruct our agenda.\nAnd specific to healthcare, we've commented several times that we would welcome bipartisan support. The Democrats who have said to us openly -- they say, look, we know Obamacare is failing. We know that insurance markets are collapsing. We know that insurers are leaving them and that rates have in many cases doubled, and some cases tripled. But we can't be a part of Obamacare repeal because that's viewed as something that was a signature accomplishment of the previous administration.\nSo there may come a time for being able to partner with them. But I don't think that happens till after this repeal.\nJon.\nQ: So, Marc, how confident are you that you'll be able to pass this Republican-only? Democrats -- you can't blame them for blocking you on this bill, this healthcare bill. How confident are you that you'll get it done by August? And if it fails, are you going to bring the Democrats down here to work on more modest fixes to the current law?\nMR. SHORT: We're confident that it's going to pass, and that we're not going to be in a situation of failure, Jon.\nBut at the same time, I think that the President recognizes that Republicans have campaigned on repeal and replace since 2010. In all candor, in many ways, he was looking forward to the day he was inaugurated having a bill on his desk to repeal it because it's something the Republicans have said they would be doing, again, since the 2010 election cycle.\nSo we're anxious to get that bill and for the President to sign it.\nQ: But if it doesn't come here by the end of -- by August, are you going to bring Democrats down here? Are we going to see --\nMR. SHORT: We still look forward to completing the repeal and replace before August.\nQ: Marc, Republican voters know that you have a majority in the Senate. You also have a 51-vote threshold. They also know the Senate Majority Leader controls the calendar, especially on executive branch nominations. So explain to them why it's only a Democratic obstruction problem?\nMR. SHORT: Well, as you understand the nature of cloture votes, it required -- that is something that in past administrations has not been required. And so --\nQ: Motion to proceed, in other words.\nMR. SHORT: Yes, thank you, Major.\nSo in previous administrations -- I know I have the number here -- it was roughly about 5 percent of nominees that were required to get cloture votes. In our case, it's been about 90 percent. So, yes, there is the process that the Republicans control the committees. In some cases I mentioned, they've gone to the extraordinary steps of actually walking out of committee hearings to deny a quorum, just delaying the process.\nAnd in many cases, we believe that part of this is obstruction because they know the most precious thing the Senate has is floor time, so if they stretch this out longer, it means you don't get to your legislative agenda. So it's part of their strategy, as well.\nBut it is historic in the level of obstruction that is denying the will of the American people who elected a new administration and expect that administration to be able to staff the departments.\nQ: Now, Marc, you told that you have confidence that healthcare will get passed by the August break. But it appears by all the reporting that we do that the trajectory is moving in the opposite direction. A greater number of Republicans are ambivalent or opposed to this currently drafted legislation than just two weeks ago. What is the source of your confidence when the outward vote counting appears to be moving in the opposite direction from the administration's vantage point?\nMR. SHORT: We look forward to being able to -- we support bills that provide I think many things that the various factions of the party were looking for.\nI think what you heard over the recess was just expressing displeasure with the previous draft that's now been amended. It includes, as you know, a lot of resources for opioid funding that many in states perhaps more in the Midwest that have been plagued by opioid addiction were looking to get. It also includes the ability to use your HSA accounts to pay for premiums, and that's something that many of the conservatives have asked for.\nWe also are waiting to see how the Cruz-Lee amendment gets scored. So we believe that the bill is changing significantly in a way that will garner the necessary votes.\nQ: Marc, thank you. Can you map out specifically what role President Trump is going to take in trying to get this bill over the finish line? Obviously in the final days of the healthcare bill's passage, he was very front and center. Is he going to take the same type of approach in these next two weeks? Obviously he has the Paris trip coming up.\nAnd then I know you're focused on plan A. But should you need a plan B as the position of this White House that Obamacare should be repealed with a plan to replace it further down the line?\nMR. SHORT: Several questions there. I think that there's a natural difference between a bill passed in the House and a bill passed in the Senate. And so when you have 435 members in the House, I do think that the appearance will be more frenetic. You'll see many members coming over here to the White House for broader meetings.\nIn the Senate, we know that the number of targeted votes is a much smaller number. And so you're not going to see that same level of activity, of members coming and outside the White House. But that doesn't mean the President isn't engaged.\nAs the President was leaving for his most recent trip on a holiday weekend, he was continuing to make calls. And he'll continue to make this case. This is a promise that Republicans have made to voters, and it's a promise that he expects them to deliver on.\nQ: Does he need the plan B option? Is it still the position of this White House, as the President tweeted several days ago, that the focus should shift to repealing Obamacare now, making sure that happens, that promise to America's voters --\nMR. SHORT: To be clear, we still believe that the bill before the United States Senate is the preferable path. I just want to state that clearly for everybody, that that is the path that we're planning on.\nBut I think the President is making a very clear point that Republicans have voted many times on a repeal bill. And when we talk about its repealing, it's important to keep in mind what that did. It continued payment for Medicaid. It continued -- it would create basically a stabilization fund to keep the markets as they are for a period of two, three years until a replacement plan is put together.\nAnd I think the President is making the case that Republicans have already cast that vote. And it's not as if markets have gotten healthier. Markets have only continued to become -- have continued to collapse.\nAnd so in light of that, it's pretty hard to explain we think how you would have voted for it 18 months ago and couldn't support the similar vote when the markets get worse than what they were.\nSo the President does recognize that he just thinks stating a simple political fact, that that's a vote they're on record. In fact, 49 of the current Republicans voted for that previously. In addition now, Todd Young voted for it in the House, and is in Senate. So right there you have 50 votes basically casting the same vote.\nQ: -- you're referring to, right, Marc?\nMR. SHORT: There's been multiple repeals. This -- was December 15th.\nQ: Back on the obstruction charge, has the President raised this directly with Senator Schumer? And how often do they communicate?\nMR. SHORT: I will leave the President's personal conversations with Senator Schumer. But keep in mind, that there are also Democrat nominees working through this process; that there are certain independent boards and agencies for which statutorily the Democrats, the minority party gets its own picks.\nAnd to date, I will grant you it's a very small sample size, but we have nominated twice as many to this point as Bush had -- sorry, as McConnell had of Republicans. So it's again, one more factor of us looking to try to be bipartisan and help to make the nominations that they're asking for. Yet there's been no reciprocation as far as a courtesy and anything but obstruction.\nQ: Back on healthcare issue, how much confidence does the President have in Senator McConnell to push this over the line?\nMR. SHORT: The President has confidence in both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell.\nQ: Marc, slightly off topic. There's a quote floating around of you saying that you think the Iran -- the drafted legislation on the Iran and Russia sanctions is poorly written. And so I want to know is the White House going to support a bill that is not poorly written? And what exactly would you like to see changed for the White House to support it?\nMR. SHORT: Thanks. To be clear, the administration's perspective is, is that we support the sanctions in the bill on Russia and Iran. Keep in mind, it's initially an Iran bill for which there is a Russia sanctions amendment. The administration is fully supportive of those sanctions.\nWhat our concern is, is that the legislation we believe sets an unusual precedent of delegating foreign policy to 535 members of Congress by not including certain national security waivers that have always been consistently part of sanctions bills in the past. And so by stripping that, what you in essence do is create I think challenge for us diplomatically and in many cases the ability to react quickly to ongoing circumstances where if a nation is cooperating with you, you can extend waivers. Or there's certain examples where there's covert activities in which it's helpful to have that ability. And by stripping that away from the executive branch, we think the way it's currently drafted is something that neither a Democrat nor a Republican administration could support.\nQ: Did the subject come up in the meetings with President Putin at all? Anything around that?\nMR. SHORT: That I'm aware of.\nQ: Marc, on healthcare, one of the reasons that so many senators are reluctant to endorse this bill right now is they're hearing a lot of opposition in their districts. They're hearing phone calls in their offices. Is there anything that the President is going to do to use his bully pulpit to make an affirmative case for the American people for this bill? We've not heard him do that so far, apart from a few tweets here and there.\nMR. SHORT: I think the President has made an affirmative case for the bill, but I think your larger point is a fair one -- that the left I think has been more organized in their messaging on this than collectively Republicans have as far as advocating for the benefits of the bill. And I fully accept that point as sort of a lesson learned moving forward.\nQ: Well, can the President do anything?\nMR. SHORT: I think that he will continue --\nQ: If he could do an address to the American people?\nMR. SHORT: The President you will -- again, I believe the President has remained very active in this debate, and you will see him continue to remain so. And as far as what plans he has for travel that maybe he could go to targeted states to make his case, I think we'll wait and see.\nQ: Marc, do you think it was the right idea, the right approach to have a more of a hands-off approach during this Senate process than he did during the House process? I know Senator McConnell asked the White House to be not directly involved in the negotiations. As it sits here right now, do you believe that that was the right approach? And what are you doing specifically this week to get the Jerry Morans and the Senator Hoevens on board? Because opioids aren't their concern.\nMR. SHORT: I reject the premise of your question. I believe that the administration has been involved. I think initially after the House bill passed, there needed to be a time of rescoring the bill. And that's what's transpired in which everyone was a little bit on the sideline.\nBut since then I think that the Vice President has been to the Senate Policy Lunch every week in which this has been the primary focus of conversation. Seema Verma from HHS has gone and had countless meetings with members who are questioning where they stand or are undecided. She's been talking to them very specifically about Medicaid funding for their states in very formulaic conversations. The Secretary of HHS, Tom Price, has been making calls and meeting with members throughout the holiday, as well.\nSo again, it's different because when you have 435 members in the House, you're going to see a lot more activity coming in and out of this building. But I think that that's a false measure for the level of activity that we have in this debate.\nQ: How do you explain the approval rating for this bill as it now sits? It's so much lower than the President's approval rating. Shouldn't it be at least as high, in the 30s or 40 or something? Why is it so low?\nMR. SHORT: I think back to Phil's question. I think that it's a fair point that the Democrats were more organized in their messaging on the bill than collectively Republicans have been in making their case for the benefits of it.\nBut I also continue to see polling that suggests that the American people do want Obamacare repealed. The number of people --\nQ: They don't like this bill, though.\nMR. SHORT: The number of people who have lost insurance, they know that it's a dramatic problem. And I think that there's more we could be doing in educating the benefits of repealing and replacing with our plan.\nQ: Marc, thank you. Part of the case you're making for this bill is that the exchanges are collapsing. And day after day Sarah and Sean stand at that podium and talk about insurance --\nMR. SHORT: God bless them.\nQ: Yes, sir. Insurance companies that are pulling out of the exchanges. But until that bill passes, Obamacare is the law of the land. And those exchanges are set up by the law. Has the administration made -- or is the administration making any effort to keep these insurance companies in the exchanges? Or are you guys just letting them pull out? What sort of effort is there to keep them in?\nMR. SHORT: It's a great question. I guess fundamentally we don't think it's the federal government's job to force and insurer to stay in the exchange. In fact, I think today what you're going to see from a report coming out this afternoon from CMS is that for the 2016 year, 281 insurers were in the private Obamacare exchanges. By 2017, it had fallen to 241. And just now -- as they're supposed to submit their bids for next year in 2018, it's down to 140 insurers. Half of the insurers have already fled the markets. I don't think they're going to give you much more evidence that this system is failing.\nQ: Just to be clear, there's been no outreach or effort on the administration's part to attempt to keep any of these companies in the exchanges?\nMR. SHORT: We continue to talk to insurers at the HHS and OMB level to continue to talk about here are things that we can do from a regulatory impact to make it easier for you. So, yes, that is happening.\nBut again, I think that we fundamentally take a different view of the way the government should work. It's not a heavy handed enforcement to say you must say in the exchanges. That's not the way we do it. The previous administration may have.\nQ: As you're talking about the healthcare bill changing, is the President listening to the diverse voices like women's groups, people from Appalachia who didn't like Obamacare but like the benefits of ACA? Is he listening to those diverse voices to be able to change it to benefit all America? Or is it just also his base he's focusing more on? Or is it all America?\nMR. SHORT: No, I think -- I appreciate the question. But I think the President recognizes he's the President of all the American people, and he wants a healthcare plan that meets all their needs. He's not looking to target a plan that just benefits his base.\nAnd so I think that he is -- there have been many countless listening sessions the President has hosted here in the White House with different groups, some that have been open to the media, some that have not. But he's heard from a wide group of people and believes that this is the best plan forward.\nQ: Tax reform update for us?\nMR. SHORT: Tax reform update -- we are continuing to have conversations. I'm actually leaving here to head to the Hill momentarily, continuing to have conversations with them on our schedule. We hope to have a plan that we're agreed upon between the House, Senate, and the White House.\nI think we've been very intentional about wanting to be on the same page and not have multiple plans, and so --\nQ: Maybe something this week?\nMR. SHORT: The schedule -- I would doubt it would be this week. I think that hopefully before the August recess is when we have it locked in place, and that we would look to begin the markup process when we return from August recess.\nQ: Can you lower the corporate rate, though, to a level that is more competitive internationally? That seemed to be a big focus.\nMR. SHORT: Absolutely, we can lower the corporate rate and absolutely the President is focused 100 percent on getting growth back in our economy.\nQ: Marc, one thing, Senator Sasse has said that if by today the Senate hadn't made meaningful progress in coming together around a single bill, they should move ahead with repeal, followed by discussing replace afterward. And the President appeared to endorse that right before -- so be clear, do you think that they've made enough progress at this point that they don't need to go down that?\nMR. SHORT: Look, I think if that's a deadline that Senator Sasse set, you should ask Senator Sasse that. I don't think the President set our official deadline on that. As we've already discussed in a previous question, I think that he's just pointing out the obvious of where the votes are in a previous repeal vote. Thank you.\nQ: Nominations. I hope you'll find it an important question. You describe this as a national security threat, the fact that there are 16 nominees on the defense side that have not been confirmed. Given that, given the Democrats' strategy, would it be a mistake if the Senate were to go on recess in August if these nominees are not confirmed?\nMR. SHORT: I think that we are looking toward confirmations by the August recess. One of the data points I gave you is a comparison of what Obama had confirmed by August recess, and that's a threshold that we'll look at.\nAnd I think that the President has every right to call Congress back if necessary I think --\nQ: Will he exercise that authority?\nMR. SHORT: Because I think you make a very fair point that I believe that the Democrat obstruction is jeopardizing national security.\nThank you.\nMS. SANDERS: Thanks, Mark.\nBefore we talk about all of the things coming up this week, I wanted to quickly give you guys a recap of the President's trip to Poland and Germany last week and some of the things that happened back here at home while we were gone.\nIn both Germany and Poland, the President sought to reinforce old alliances and build new relationships, just as he promised he would do in his Inaugural Address to serve the interests of the American people.\nIn Poland, President Trump gave a powerful and historic speech in Warsaw that was widely praised both in Poland and the United States as one of the most important speeches by an American President on foreign soil in decades.\nIn his speech, the President saluted the spirit of the Polish people over centuries of hardship, and especially the Polish heroes of the Warsaw Uprising and those in the struggle to defeat communism.\nThe President reaffirmed that the NATO Alliance of free, sovereign, and strong independent nations is in the best interests of America and the security of the American people. He also reaffirmed America's commitment to Article 5 of the NATO treaty and called upon member states to honor their full and fair financial obligations.\nBut even more importantly, the Warsaw Speech was a stirring defense of the West in a manner not heard from an American President in many years. Using the Polish experience as an example, President Trump reminded us of the shared history, culture, and values that have made Western civilization great and urged the nations of the West to defend it from new threats inside and out.\nPresident Trump concluded by challenging the nations of the West to remember our histories, have confidence in our values, and have pride in who we are. He proclaimed that by remembering these strengths, we will continue to be the greatest, freest, most successful community of nations in history.\nIn Germany, the President successfully achieved his objectives on behalf of the American people at the G20.\nIn his discussions with more than a dozen foreign leaders, he underscored the need for nations to join together to strip terrorists of their funding, territory and ideological support -- and to stop doing business with nations that sponsor terrorism, especially Iran.\nOn North Korea, he called on all nations to isolate the regime and to cut off all ties of trade and commerce.\nAt the same time, he hailed the launch of the World Bank's Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, of which the United States is a founding member, to help empower women all across the world.\nIn his meetings, President Trump also underscored the need to end unfair trade practices and to finally provide American workers and businesses with a level playing field.\nThe trip to Poland and participation in the G20 summit have given the President tremendous cause for hope. He returned to the United States with great optimism for the future and incredible excitement for what lies ahead.\nOn Friday, while the President was participating in those important discussions at the G20, the June jobs report came out back here at home. Sadly there wasn't a lot of coverage of these numbers, so I wanted to give you a few highlights: There were --222,000 new jobs were added in June, higher than the monthly average over the past year and well above expectations. With 187,000 private sector jobs added in June, there have now been over 800,000 private sector jobs added since the President took office.\nAnd on top of all that, the jobs report from April and May were revised upward reflecting that an additional 47,000 jobs were added in those months than previously reported.\nLooking ahead, as Marc told you, congressional Democrats are committed to inaction. Republicans are driving a lot of action on the Hill this week. Both houses are taking up important legislation on defense spending, military construction, and veterans affairs spending. And of course, the Senate is continuing to work on the Republican plan to repeal and replace the collapsing Obamacare system before it completely falls apart.\nJust today, the Gallup-Sharecare survey showed that nearly 2 million adults in the United States dropped out of healthcare coverage this year. That's 2 million more Americans who are being completely failed by the last administration's broken promises; 2 million more Americans who deserve better, and they're only a small part of the picture of those families and individuals who are suffering under the current system.\nFor those 2 million Americans and the countless others we hear about each time another insurer pulls out of a state's exchange or one of the dwindling number of co-ops fails, it's critical that the Senate moves swiftly and decisively to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that truly supports everyone to get the healthcare coverage they need.\nLater this week, of course, the President will be in France, and we will have more details on that trip in the coming days. While the President is in France, the Vice President will deliver the opening keynote address to the National Governors Association's Summer Meeting on Friday. And as a former governor, the Vice President will speak with some of his former colleagues about the President's commitment to partnering with the states on issues like infrastructure, healthcare, and education. While in Rhode Island for the event, he will also meet with the Prime Minister of Canada, who is attending the NGA meeting to continue our country's productive conversations on immigration, security, and trade -- including renegotiating NAFTA.\nBefore I take your questions, I want to read a statement from the President on some recent current events.\nToday, Iraqi Security Forces supported by the United States in the global coalition, liberated the city of Mosul from its longtime nightmare under the rule of ISIS. We congratulate Prime Minister Abadi, the Iraqi Security Forces, and all the Iraqis for their victory over terrorists who are the enemies of all civilized people. We mourn the thousands of Iraqis brutally killed by ISIS and the millions of Iraqis who suffered at the hands of ISIS. We grieve with the Iraqi people for the loss of heroic soldiers who gave their lives to restore life to their country, and we honor their sacrifice.\nWe in the United States and the global coalition are proud to stand with the Iraqi Security Forces and all those who made this moment of liberation possible. We've made tremendous progress against ISIS more in the past six months than the years since ISIS became a major threat. The victory in Mosul, a city where ISIS once proclaimed its so-called caliphate, signals that its days in Iraq and Syria are numbered. We will continue to seek the total destruction of ISIS.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. And, because he's not always here and he's a fellow Arkansan, Frank Lockwood.\nQ: Thank you.\nMS. SANDERS: Because I get to pick. (Laughter.)\nQ: The President, today, tweeted that it would be unimaginable -- he can't imagine that Congress would go home from Washington in August, take the month off -- if they haven't dealt with the repeal and replace of Obamacare. If Congress does the unimaginable and goes for a month, is the President prepared to ensure that there are consequences for those vacationing lawmakers in 2018?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that he's going to lay out a list of consequences. I think he's focused on the positive component of this, and that's the hope that all of the members of Congress will come together to repeal and replace Obamacare. That's his focus -- is making sure it gets done. Not on what happens if it doesn't.\nQ: If I could ask on one more tweet. The President also tweeted this morning about Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton -- said that she was giving away the country, I believe. At what point is the President going to put Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Bill Clinton in the rearview mirror? He won the election. He won it fair and square. When does he just let them go and look forward?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe this tweet was a response to the attacks on his daughter taking his seat, if I'm correct. Is that the one you're referring to, Frank?\nQ: Yeah.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, this wasn't about putting them in the front. This was about responding to an outrageous attack against a White House senior advisor. And it's pretty standard protocol that when the leader gets up, someone takes their seat -- as Chancellor Merkel also pointed out and said that this was perfectly standard protocol.\nIn fact, I think that we should be proud to have Ivanka sitting in that seat, considering particularly the topic at hand was part of her portfolio. If she didn't have the last name that she has, I think she would be constantly celebrated instead of constantly attacked, and I frankly think it's a sad thing that they chose to go after her in that moment.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sarah, first, just a quick clarification from the meeting with Putin in Germany: Did the President say that he accepted Putin's denial of any involvement in election interference, as Putin said in his press conference? Have you had a chance to ask the President about that?\nMS. SANDERS: The President was -- multiple times asked Putin whether or not he was involved. It took up a great deal of the conversation that they had on the front end of their meeting, and the President heard Putin's denial and also realized they had some very important topics they needed to cover -- Ukraine, North Korea, Syria -- and decided to move on from that point of the conversation and focus on those issues.\nQ: But he didn't accept that denial or did he?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, he heard Putin's denial and he knew that at the end of the day the important part was them being able to have that conversation, him to directly ask him. He heard his answer and he moved forward with places that they thought they could work together. The President has been clear from his statements back in January and even in his tweets over the last couple of days, his opinion on that matter.\nQ: And the question I wanted to ask was the reports on this meeting that took place at Trump Tower last June with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner. When did the President learn that that meeting had taken place?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe in the last couple of days is my understanding.\nQ: Is he concerned about that -- that the top leadership of his campaign would take a meeting with a Russian lawyer promising to give negative information?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I mean, I've been on several campaigns and people call offering information. As I know many of you receive similar calls of people offering information. Don Jr. took a very short meeting from which there was absolutely no follow-up. Frankly, I think something that may make sense is looking at the Democrat National Committee coordinated opposition research directly with the Ukrainian Embassy. This is not an accusation, that's an on-the-record action that they took. So if you're looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC who actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy. And no one in this room to my knowledge really had a big problem with that.\nThe only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed. At this point, I'd also like to add, Donald Trump Jr. has made a statement on this, the President's outside counsel has made a statement on it, and now I have as well and I'm not going to add anything further.\nPhil.\nQ: Just to follow up on that. If this sort of meeting is normal and standard practice in the campaign, do you know if there were any other meetings that either Donald Trump Jr. or other representatives of the Trump campaign had with other Russian officials or any other foreign agent to collect information about Hillary?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know of any other meetings with Don Jr., but I also haven't had an extensive conversation with him.\nQ: Has anyone looked into whether there were any others?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, Phil. I'll have to check and get back to you.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I have a quick question about this cyber taskforce with Russia. Yesterday the President tweeted about the cybersecurity unit being put together, and then then about 12 hours later said that it would never happen. What went down in those 12 hours that so drastically changed that situation?\nMS. SANDERS: This was part of a discussion in that meeting and, look, we recognize that Russia is a cyber threat, but we also recognize the need to have conversations with our adversaries. And when our adversaries see strength like they did with the President in the meeting, they can look for other ways to work on shared interests and look for positive places where they can move the ball forward. Particularly on things like the ceasefire, and that became a greater focus and something the President chose to stay focused on -- is that front.\nMajor.\nQ: Sarah, just to clarify: That idea is dead?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I would say that discussions may still take place but that's as far as it is right now.\nQ: Okay. And I know you just said a minute ago you aren't going to make any additional statement, but there's a history and we have been asked by you and others at the podium to respect the statements you make there. So, there's a long history of blanket denials, during the transition and during times of this administration about nobody within the campaign having any meetings under any circumstances at all with Russian officials. And now one was disclosed this weekend. The original characterization of that meeting was amended within 24 hours when new information was placed before Don Jr. How are we to take all of these blanket denials that occurred through the transition and now when it has been proven and recognized by the President's attorney and Don Jr. that those blanket denials were not factual?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the point is that we've tried to make every single time, today and then, and will continue to make in those statements is that there was simply no collusion that they keep trying to create that there was.\nQ: But that's a different question than was asked at the time and different than the statements were about. The questions originally, as you know and I know, were about contacts, and those were blanket denials. And then when the contacts became confirmed, then it was, well they were infrequent. Well now we have a whole pattern of lots of different meetings that have to be confirmed later. And those original questions were not about collusion, Sarah. They were just about contacts.\nMS. SANDERS: They were originally about that. That's the whole premise of what you're asking the question is whether or not the campaign colluded with Russia. That's the premise of the entire scope of your questioning, and the point we've tried to make over and over again and will continue to make is that there wasn't. And beyond that, I really can't offer you anything.\nQ: Sarah, back to yesterday morning's tweets. Can you tell us what it was or what is or what was going to be a cybersecurity unit and how this was going to work?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure there were specific details discussed. I think it was simply just a discussion on cybersecurity threats and potential options. Not necessarily a formal kind of structure in place.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. After this two and a half hour meeting with President Putin that the President had in Germany, how would you describe the state of U.S. relations with Russia. Do you view Russia as a partner? Do you view them as an ally? Do you view them as an adversary?\nMS. SANDERS: I would want to have further conversations with members of the Secretary of State, National Security Council, but I think we saw that there were places of shared interest that we can work together; specifically, things like the Syrian ceasefire, that we both can agree on in order to move forward in some places. I don't think that's going to be the case on everything, but there are certainly certain instances where we can work together with Russia to make every part of the world a little bit safer.\nQ: And does the President trust President Putin?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't asked him that question.\nQ: Can you please ask him that question?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I have two questions. We know there was no note taker in the meeting, but did you make an audio recording of the meeting or did the Russians?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. I'd have to ask. I'm not sure.\nQ: Can you ask?\nAnd the second question is: Director Comey was under oath when he said that the memo that he gave to his friend did not include classified information, and the President tweeted this morning that he did leak classified information. Is he accusing Comey of perjury?\nMS. SANDERS: I think there are a lot of questions out there and a lot of reports where it indicates that Director Comey may have leaked classified information. That certainly is a threat to the national security and violates policy.\nQ: You believe he leaked classified information?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it is something that should be investigated thoroughly.\nQ: But the President stated flatly that he leaked classified information.\nMS. SANDERS: He's got a much higher clearance. He may know something I don't.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, I want to go back to a couple of questions. When you talk about the issue of Don Jr., you talk and you said leaked. What do you think about the word whistleblower?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: You're trying to say people who gave that information were leakers. What about the issue of whistleblower? What do you see whistleblower versus leaker?\nMS. SANDERS: I think this is a voluntary disclosure to include some of that information, and I think that it would be inappropriate for that to be shared outside of the scope of the people that should have that information.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Sarah, I just have one more question. So on the issue of collusion, are you saying there's no collusion when it comes to the overall arch of the campaign? But what about the individuals? What about individuals that could be suspects of collusion? Are you vouching just for everyone in total or individuals or what?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm saying that the President's campaign did not collude in any way.\nQ: So then when we go to different people, what do you say about that? Don Jr.? Anyone -- the names that are coming up.\nMS. SANDERS: I would certainly say Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election.\nQ: What about Flynn? What about Flynn?\nMS. SANDERS: To my knowledge, he did not collude with anybody to influence the campaign. Again, I think I've been very clear, our position is that no one within the Trump campaign colluded in order to influence the election. I think the bottom line is that the Democrats had a weak candidate, and President Trump had a stronger message, and they're constantly looking for ways to undermine the President and delegitimize his election victory.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two brief questions. When the President arrived for the G20 Summit, it was widely reported that the Putin regime was cracking down on the opposition candidate -- Mr. Navalny at the time. This has been just the latest in a series of events in which human rights and dissent have been crushed in Russia. Was human rights raised at all by the President in his conversations with the Russian President?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'll have to ask, John, and get back to you on that.\nQ: Alright. My other question is --\nMS. SANDERS: I knew there was a second one coming.\nQ: The President did talk privately with Chancellor Merkel, we know. Days before he arrived there, her party, the Christian Democratic Union, made a much publicized change in its platform and dropped its reference to the United States as a friend and changed that to important ally. Was this something that came up in their meeting and did the President ask why she did that?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I haven't heard that that was specifically discussed, but I'll be happy to ask and circle back with you.\nTrey.\nQ: Two quick questions for you. Did President Trump discuss sanctions with Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit?\nMS. SANDERS: I do know that it was mentioned. Specifically, when you ask about sanctions I know there is a little bit of a question there, and there were sanctions specific to election meddling that I believe were discussed, but not beyond that.\nQ: Did the President's views on sanctions against the Russians change at all after his meeting with President Putin?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. This latest meeting with the Russian lawyer. We not have three instances where -- including with Ambassador Kislyak and a head of the Russia bank -- where Jared Kushner seems to have met with Russians and not disclosed it during his security clearance check. Is the White House at all concerned about that and do you think it raises any questions about Kushner's confidence or honesty?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe, actually, it was disclosed on his security clearance when it updated -- yeah --\nQ: His updated paperwork, not initially.\nMS. SANDERS: Right. With all of his contacts from during the transition and prior to that, they were all included in the update, not the original.\nQ: So I'm saying -- his omission in the original of all these meetings with Russians, is there any concern about that?\nMS. SANDERS: No, because it was just an incomplete form. All of his foreign contacts were listed in the updated version not in the original.\nSorry, Steve.\nQ: One of the subjects President Macron wants to talk to the President about is the Paris climate accord. Is the President willing to negotiate his position on this?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly think he likes to keep all things on the negotiating table. At the end of the day, the President is very focused on making sure that he gets the best deal for the American people. He certainly wants to do things to protect the environment, as we have a history of doing in the United States. He's going to continue that practice and continue to encourage it but also make sure that he's making the deal that's best for the American people.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 3:13 P.M.

For your recording purposes, this background briefing on the President's upcoming foreign travel is off-camera and not for broadcast. Attribution for your briefing is senior administration official. This information will be embargoed until the conclusion of the briefing and we'll release a transcript afterwards.\nOkay, so open remarks and when my colleague calls on you, please identify who you are, and your outlet, so he knows who he's speaking with. Thanks.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for being here. For the next few minutes I'd like to brief you on the President's upcoming trip to Paris later this week.\nThe President will arrive in Paris midmorning on Thursday, July 13th to conduct meetings with President Macron of France and to participate the next day in annual Bastille Day celebrations at the invitation of President Macron, and the First Lady will also accompany.\nOn arrival on Thursday morning, the President will move to the U.S. Embassy for a meet-and-greet with embassy staff and also with U.S. participants who will be in the Bastille Day festivities on the following day, Friday.\nFollowing the meet-and-greet, he will have a working lunch with senior members of his delegation and senior U.S. military leaders participating in the ceremonies. They include the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joseph Dunford; the Commander of U.S. European Command and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Mike Scaparrotti; and the Army Vice Chief of Staff, General James McConville.\nLater in the afternoon, the President and First Lady will be greeted by President and Mrs. Macron at the Hotel Invalides. And while there, they will be hosted for a tour of the tomb of Marshal Foch, who was the Supreme Allied Commander at the end of World War I, the French National War Museum, and also the tomb of Napoleon.\nThe tour will be followed by bilateral meetings with President Macron and his senior advisors. The meeting will focus on Syria and counterterrorism topics. We also anticipate the two Presidents, in the introductory one-on-one meeting, will also share perspectives from the recent G20 meeting.\nThe bilateral discussion will be followed by a press event where President Macron and President Trump will make remarks followed by questions from the media.\nLater that evening, the President and the First Lady will be hosted for a private dinner by President and Mrs. Macron.\nOn Friday, July 14th, the President and First Lady will participate as guests of honor in the annual Bastille Day ceremonies on the Avenue des Champs-Élysé. This is the French National Day.\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the entry of American troops onto French soil and into World War I. As they do every year, French troops from all of the French military services will participate. This year will also feature participation by U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines from the Army's 1st Infantry Division -- of note because this was also the first U.S. unit to enter France and actually participated in the Bastille Day festivities in 1917 and was the first U.S. unit to go into combat -- the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which is also based in Europe; the 10th Mountain Division; U.S. Army Europe's 7th Army Training Command; sailors from U.S. Naval Forces Europe; airmen from U.S. Air Forces Europe; and Marines from U.S. Marine Forces Europe.\nThe U.S. Air Force demonstration team, the Thunderbirds, will also participate and conduct a fly-over during the ceremony. And there will be one U.S. naval aviator who will pilot a French Rafale fighter plane as part of the festivities. Three U.S. veterans of the Normandy invasion will also be present.\nAt the conclusion of the Bastille Day ceremonies, the President and First Lady will depart.\nSo that's a quick overview of the President's trip. I'm happy to take your questions at this time. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: I had two questions, sort of unrelated. On climate, you did mention that those were the subjects. So is that just completely off the table, or is the President going to entertain any discussions on that? Obviously very contentious with President Macron. My second question has nothing to do with that, so I can wait until after you answer that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, sure. The conduct of the bilateral session which is scheduled for something like an hour, an hour and 15 minutes, is based on topics that were coordinated with the French President. It's entirely possible that President Macron will raise the issue. And if he does, the President has spoken on the issue a number of times and he'll be ready to engage in that as well.\nQ: I mean, did they discuss that enough during the G20 Summit? Is that why it's not being prioritized this time around? Or is there any reason?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I can't speak for the French. They asked to focus the discussion on Syria and CT, but it's entirely possible that it may come up on the margins.\nQ: Got it. Totally unrelated topic, but since we have you, the BBC was reporting today that President Trump will not have an official visit to the UK this year -- maybe not a state visit either. We're trying to kind of determine what the plan is. He said he's going to go last week. So if you don't mind, if you have any clarity on that, that would be great.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, what we know about that is that the United Kingdom has extended an invitation for a state visit, the President has accepted, and the timing is being worked out between the two governments right now.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: What are you guys hoping to accomplish with this trip? Obviously it's really short. Is there anything by way of deliverables that you could expect? Or what's the goal here?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, let's keep in mind what the, sort of, centerpiece of the trip is, which is the French National Day and its celebration of the 100th anniversary of U.S. forces entering World War I -- an entry which was really decisive, historically. The French Army had sustained horrendous losses over three years of war; Russia had just fallen out of the war because of the Bolshevik Revolution, so a million German forces were being transferred to the Western Front. And so while we certainly didn't win the war by ourselves, the American contribution was decisive in the outcome of the war.\nSo I think that's the primary reason of this particular visit at this particular time. The national guest of honor, the nation which is the guest of honor, is the United States for this year's Bastille Day celebration, and the President and First Lady have been invited as guest of honor for that. And so, of course, while there they're going to use the opportunity to discuss topics of mutual interest, but that's really the centerpiece of this visit.\nYes, sir.\nQ: We saw the President and President Macron talking a lot on the sidelines at the G20. They seemed to spend a significant amount of time together, and you seem to mention that as separate from the Syria and counterterrorism things. So I'm wondering if there were specific policies or topics that they were going to want to follow up on in this bilat.\nAnd then, secondly, if you could kind of put the President's visit and how you see it into, I guess, the broader context of what President Macron has been trying to do in his, sort of, first months in office. Obviously, President Putin was visiting a few weeks ago. He's kind of had a number of these big events. Just kind of maybe some insight into how you -- what you see as some of their reason for wanting to do this.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Pretty broad question. Of course, the President is going to be prepared to discuss a wide range of topics. I think that goes without saying. But we expect most of the discussion to focus on what's going on in Syria right now, and then the French and American cooperation both inside the alliance and bilaterally with respect to that, and counterterrorism issues not only in Syria, but in other places.\nI think I'll just leave it at that. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: You said the two leaders would be sharing perspectives from the G20. Can you elaborate on that? What specifically -- which specific perspective does President Trump hope to share with President Macron?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, what I mean by that is both leaders had a number of pull-asides and bilateral exchanges with other heads of state. And what we expect is that President Macron and President Trump, when they have their private one-on-one session, will probably ask each other about those: What were your impressions of your meeting with, I don't know, Prime Minister May or President Putin, or whatever. I think that's highly likely.\nAnd then, after the one-on-one session, they will move into a group session where their senior advisors will come in and they'll get on with the more formal agenda. That's what I meant by that.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Can you characterize the dynamic between President Macron and President Trump during those G20 meetings, and whether the issue of migration came up, and if that's something that they're going to talk about during this visit?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't believe they had a formal bilateral session at the G20. And the reason is because they've spoken at length a number of times before and knew they were going to be meeting in Paris this week. So that's the -- I guess that's the answer to that.\nMore generally, I would characterize the relationship between the two of them as being very positive. I've personally been present at a number of phone calls between the two of them. I see the chemistry as being very good. There are some issues where we see the world a little bit differently, but many issues where we see the world more or less the same. The French are and have been, and will be, very close security partners of ours who cooperate in many different domains and on many different issues. And I think the relationship, still in its early stages, is a very, very good one.\nQ: Can I follow up on that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure.\nQ: There was a lot made of the body language between Macron and Trump in their two handshakes. There was one at the G20, too, where they had this sawing motion, this sort of strong handshake. Is there anything larger to say about that? Are they rivals? Are they entering into a rivalry here in any way? Can you expand on that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't want to get into characterizing body language. I do share with you -- my personal observation has been that their chemistry is quite positive and very good. President Macron really is an innovative, charismatic guy who's trying to do some different things in France, and his political party didn't exist a couple of years ago. So in that respect, he's been a real trailblazer. And I think both of them think they have some things in common in their experience. Obviously, many differences, but some things in common. So I see it as a very positive developing relationship.\nIn the back. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you talk about -- are you expecting any sort of protests at all during the President's time there?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Always possible. But President Macron has indicated he doesn't expect to see anything of particular note on this, certainly nothing like we see at all the G20 events.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you. A couple for you. First, I know that Secretary Mattis has been asking NATO partners to pony up troop contributions for the new strategy. Does the United States at this point have everything it needs from France, or will the President be asking President Macron directly for troop contributions?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The President is consistent in this message whenever he meets NATO as a body, or whenever he meets his counterparts among the NATO allied nations. France is currently spending 1.8 percent of its GDP, so it's very close to the 2 percent target that was agreed at Wales in 2014. And their numbers are trending in a positive direction, and they've assured the President that they have every intention of meeting the Wales targets, which are supposed to be met by 2024.\nI sort of remind the audience that France is far and away one of the largest and strongest military members of the alliance and spends an awful lot of defense right now, and carries a heavy load in the counterterrorism fight, in particular in places so that really we don't have to. So when you consider that the Sahel, for example, is half the size of the United States, and the French are carrying on the counterterrorism effort there with 4,000 or 5,000 French soldiers, I mean, their contributions are great.\nI think the President is happy with where France is and doesn't see that as a particular issue.\nQ: And then, on a lighter note, are there cultural sights that the President would like to see while he's in Paris?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, he's not going to be there very long, but, yeah, I think what he's going to see at the Invalides is going to be great. That's where the French President would like to take him. So there's going to be a real photo opportunity there. And then, if you've ever been on the Champs-Élysé for Bastille Day, it's pretty spectacular. There's not a lot of time, given the meetings that they've scheduled for the President to see other sights.\nYes, please.\nQ: Thank you, sir.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You're from where, please?\nQ: Oh, I'm from NHK Japan. So we're hearing reports that Chancellor Merkel is going to be meeting with President Macron on July 13th in Paris, before the meeting with Trump. Is there any possibility that President Trump will also have the opportunity to meet with Chancellor Merkel, or that the three of them will be able to meet?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, I don't think so. That's not on the schedule right now. We're aware that President Macron and his senior team are meeting with Chancellor Merkel and her senior team all through the morning of the 13th. I think they finish at something like 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon. But there's no plan right now.\nThe President, as you're aware, met at some length with Chancellor Merkel at the G20.\nYes, ma'am, right here.\nQ: Is there going to be any discussions of any trade issues while they're there? T-TIP? Any bilateral? Any trade at all?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Always possible. There's an hour and 15 minutes blocked. They may run a little bit longer than that. Obviously, the President is always ready, willing and able to talk about issues of importance to the American worker and to the American economy. And there's every possibility that it will be raised. But we've been asked to focus on preparing, and the President has been focused on preparing specifically for Syria and CT topics.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, sir. From your understanding with the conversations that President Trump and President Macron have had so far, do they view the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism in the same way?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think there's a lot of commonality in their worldview and in their perspective. I don't know if I would go so far as to say that it's an identical perspective, because obviously the French experience is different from ours. But broadly speaking, I would say they see the threat in much the same way. Yes.\nQ: Also, just to follow up -- after the events on the Champs-Élysées, President Macron is traveling down to Nice, France --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He is.\nQ: -- for the memorial associated with the events of last year -- the terrorist act last year. Did President Macron extend an invitation to President Trump to go down with him to Nice as well?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, no, he did not. Although the President will address that event, I think, in his remarks.\nYes, please.\nQ: Tara McKelvey, BBC. I know that the U.S. and France have had a close military relationship in the past, and it seems like you're trying to build on this. So could you tell us a little bit of what the President has said about France? Like, is he looking forward to the trip to Paris? How does he see the relationship between the two countries?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: When the President -- President Macron asked him if he would -- so they extended a formal invitation, a written invitation, and then, in a subsequent phone call when President Macron asked him to come, he was excited to tender the invitation in person, and President Trump was very excited to respond to it and to accept the invitation. So, yes, I think he's very excited. The First Lady is very excited. Anytime that you can go visit a couple like the Macrons in the City of Light, it's pretty tremendous.\nOn this particular day, however, it's got added significance. So I think the President is excited and very much looking forward to that.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Ayesha Rascoe with Reuters. There was some talk after the G20 that the U.S. was a bit isolated, especially on issues like climate change. Do you feel like -- or does the administration feel like this trip to France is, at all, a way of showing that the U.S. is still engaged in international issues and still kind of leading on the world stage?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the U.S. is engaged in international leadership. It is engaged on the world stage. The President -- every leader at the G20 came in with a request to meet personally with President Trump. So I think that that pretty much says it all right there.\nYes, please.\nQ: I'm Jackie from CBS.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi, Jackie.\nQ: You just spoke in pretty glowing terms about the city of Paris, which isn't the way the President has spoken of the city in the past. He said it's not what it used to be. Will he clarify those remarks at all?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I don't think the President is going to clarify earlier remarks. From everything that I've seen and everything that I've heard, the President has got very positive feelings about the city of Paris, and the people who live in Paris, and the French nation more generally.\nQ: Well, he spoke pretty disparaging of the city during the campaign.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not in a position to characterize that. I can only tell you what I've seen and heard since I've been here.\nQ: Okay. And then, just once more, is there a reason that this visit was prioritized? I'm sure he gets lots of invitations to visit other countries.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, there are few allies that are closer that France. And I think when President Macron asked, the President was happy to accept.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you tell us which administration official principals are going to be accompanying the President on this trip?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes. The White House Chief of Staff will accompany, the National Security Advisor, and the Homeland Security Advisor will accompany. We will also meet Chairman General Dunford in Paris.\nYes, please.\nQ: Just a point of clarification. This will be a press conference with questions -- two questions each. Is that --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's right. I think both President Macron and President Trump will make brief remarks, perhaps 10 minutes each. And they'll be followed by two questions for President Macron and two questions for President Trump -- is the format.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Does the U.S. have a position on an EU Army and just defense integration, period? I ask that because you said they would be talking about Syria. We've been told that they'll be talking about the military. And I'm wondering what the position is on that, especially with respect to NATO.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. I think our position about an EU Army can be pretty simply summed up. Where additional European security measures and capabilities can be brought to bear in the service of American interests and European interests -- and, of course, they're conjoined in so many ways -- then I think we support it.\nWhere an EU Army might evolve over time and become, in some ways, a competition to the NATO Alliance -- which we see as the primary security provider for the transatlantic union -- then I think we might have some questions and we would want to engage on that.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can I just ask you a (inaudible) kind of question? Can you describe whether the President has ever talked about his previous visits to Paris? Is there any color that you can add about him ever rhapsodizing about visiting Paris before? And also, will he return to the White House or will he return to New Jersey?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I'm not in a position to characterize or add color to that particular question. And I wish I could, but I'm just not in a position to do that. He's going to return to the United States --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't think that (inaudible) put out yet.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know if they nailed that down.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't say yes, but we'll keep you posted.\nAIDE: We have time for two more questions and then we have to wrap things up.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Or zero, if you don't have any.\nAIDE: Or zero. (Laughter.)\nQ: With President Trump requesting that NATO countries spend more on defense, that could benefit the French industrial complex significantly. Is that a piece of the conversation? Is Donald Trump going there to try to make sure that big countries also buy American weaponry as they ramp up, and not just go to the French?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah. You know, part of the conversation that usually gets left out is that there's a 2 percent goal, but there's a 20 percent goal. And the 20 percent goal is just as important. And that's a commitment to spend at least 20 percent of national defense spending for NATO allies on actual capability, on equipment. Right? Because there are lots of things that you can spend defense funds on that would mean very little in the way of actual capability for NATO. And the French are very serious about that.\nYou probably saw, from the President's trip in Warsaw, the announcement that the Poles are going to do a big buy of our Patriot Air Defense Missile System and also the HIMARS system, which is sort of a long-range rocket artillery system.\nSo where it makes sense, where there's a market, and where's there's interest in American technology -- which is the best in the world -- then, yes, the President is going to press that. But these are national decisions. Of course, France has its own military industry as well, and they're going to take that into account also.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you. Jake Turx, Ami Magazine. You had mentioned just earlier that part of the trip is to highlight World War I. And my question is, is there any particular message that the administration might want to be focusing in on, particularly draw any parallels between World War I and any events that are going on in the world today?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, thank you very much. I'm sure the President will mention that -- address that in his remarks. So the fact that we participated in such a major way in World War I, side by side with the French, is a clear parallel to what we're doing today. We still live in a dangerous world. We still live in a world that has many, many threats.\nThe French were strong allies -- so, with us in Afghanistan, in the Gulf War. There were with us in the Korean War, as well. So we have a long history -- not always marching in lockstep, but real friends and real allies. And so there are clear parallels to our partnership and our alliances 100 years ago and today, no question about that. That's a big part of why the President is going to be there this week.\nI think that's all we have time for. Thanks very much.\nEND 3:55 P.M.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126640", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:26 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Before I get into the issues of today and take your questions, I first want to take a minute to acknowledge the 16 servicemen and women who lost their lives yesterday in a crash of a Marine Corps transport plane in Mississippi. As of now, the investigation into the details of the crash is still ongoing, but as the President said this morning, this is a truly heartbreaking incident. The thoughts and prayers of the entire administration are with the friends and families of the Marines who died in this tragic accident.\nYesterday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a report showing that half of the insurers who initially offered plans on the Obamacare exchanges have already fled the markets. I know that similar reports and announcements like these are coming out literally every day, but each of these announcements further reveal the failure of Obamacare.\nFor the millions of American families and individuals caught in the fallout of Obamacare's collapse, these reports come as no surprise. They have been suffering the consequences of this failed law firsthand for far too long, and it's time for Senate Republicans to step up and fulfill the promise they made to those Americans by repealing and replacing it.\nTomorrow, the Vice President will meet with another group of companies and individuals who have been harmed by Obamacare in Kentucky, continuing the nationwide travel he's been doing throughout this entire repeal and replace process.\nThe President is determined to sign a bill that restores choice to the American people as soon as possible. Of course, while Republicans are working around the clock -- and as Senator McConnell just announced, well into August -- to address some of our biggest legislative priorities, and as Marc and I both told you yesterday, Democrats are looking to set a record for pointless and dangerous obstruction.\nI know Marc went through some of the numbers with you yesterday but there are just a few that I find truly astounding and would like to reiterate. While more than 90 percent of the previous administration's nominations were confirmed by a simple voice vote, Democrats in the Senate have allowed only approximately 10 percent of President Trump's nominees to be voted on in that way.\nAs I mentioned, we're coming up on the August recess of President Trump's first term, by which point the Senate has confirmed 69 percent of President Obama's nominations. Less than a month out from that same point, the Senate has confirmed only approximately 23 percent of President Trump's nominees.\nThese numbers show the Democrats' true colors. They're willing to play political games with the safety and security of the American economy and the American people, rather than work with this administration to solve the serious problems our nation faces. It's shameful that they are shirking the responsibility of the American people to put them in office to carry out -- to protect and promote our nation and its citizens. It's well past time that Senate Democrats stop this unprecedented obstruction.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions. Kevin.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. At what point did the President discuss with Donald Trump, Jr. that meeting? Have you had a chance to get a sense of what he feels about this entire story as it continues to unfold? What's your sense on that? And then a follow-up?\nMS. SANDERS: I've got a quick statement that I will read from the President: \"My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.\"\nAnd beyond that, I'm going to have to refer everything on this matter to Don Jr.'s counsel and outside counsel, and won't have anything else to add beyond that today.\nQ: That's your words, at the end?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, the end, I'm sorry.\nQ: And if I could follow up really quickly about the accident. How soon afterward did the President learn about what happened? What was the tick-tock, in terms of that? Did he get immediate word or did it sort of go through a certain chain of events?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure on the exact process. I'll have to check. I know he was aware of the situation, briefed on the situation, and continued to get updates on it. But I don't know the exact tick-tock so I'll have to circle back with you on that, Kevin.\nJill.\nQ: Sarah, given these emails, you had somebody who was identified as a Russian government lawyer; Don Jr. agreeing to meet with him, being told in those emails that the Russian government was trying to help the President win the election. Do you stand by a statement you made yesterday when you said that \"Our position is that no one within the Trump campaign colluded in order to influence the election\"?\nMS. SANDERS: I do. And again, I don't have -- beyond the statements yesterday and what I read today, I don't have anything else to add, Jill.\nQ: And when was the last time the two of them spoke, Don Jr. and the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Do you know the last time the President spoke with Don Jr.?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks. So the White House hasn't disputed any of the following, which is that the President's son, campaign chairman, and son-in-law had this meeting with the express purpose of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton and with knowledge of the Russian government supporting Trump's campaign. How is that not collusion?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, I know you guys are going to get tired of it today -- and not to sound like a broken record -- but on all questions related to this matter, I would refer you to Don Jr.'s counsel and outside counsel.\nQ: But you're not disputing any of the facts?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm simply referring you to people that can answer that question, Matthew.\nAlex.\nQ: Sarah, in January the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians, and the White House stood by that statement. Was the President misled or was he not truthful?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, to repeat myself, I'm going to refer you to the outside counsel, and I don't have anything else to add.\nQ: Sarah, can we ask you, why weren't you interested in answering the question yesterday, and why the President is not answering the questions himself either through you or directly today? What changed between yesterday and today?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President gave a statement on the matter, which I read to you. And like I've said, I don't have anything else to add beyond that.\nQ: Is the President still of a mind that he would like the investigation under the special counsel and committees on Capitol Hill to work as expeditiously as possible, and he wants to cooperate, and wants his family members and his top aides here at the White House to cooperate?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. That's never changed since day one. We'd love to get this matter closed and focus on the big priorities of the American people.\nQ: So, Sarah, let me follow up. So by not answering the questions directly himself, or through you, is that in his mind expediting the investigation or is it blocking the investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth on that.\nMaggie.\nQ: Sarah, when the White House says there was no collusion, what does the White House mean? What is the definition of collusion?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I've said all that we're going to say on that matter. And anything further, you guys are going to have to reach out to outside counsel.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, the words \"collusion\" have been used, other words have been used, \"obstruction of justice.\" They're saying now that's not even half of it. It could be treason or perjury. What does the White House have to say? There are new terms brought into this; new serious -- more serious terms brought into this.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know how many times we'll have to address this.\nQ: I'm not asking about Don Jr. I'm asking about these words being brought into this equation that you want -- this White House wants this whole investigation to be gone. There are new words now brought in.\nMS. SANDERS: I think those new words are ridiculous.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I have two questions for you. First, asking specifically about actions taken by White House staff in the last 72 hours --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, White House what?\nQ: By White House staff recently, to something that should not require you deferring to special counsel. Can you talk about who inside the White House has been involved in your response on this? Has the President been kept in the loop, the Chief of Staff and others in the administration? Are you looking into potential communications by others on the White House staff in regards to this matter or similar matters?\nMS. SANDERS: All of the appropriate parties have been part of that conversation and part of that discussion.\nQ: Jared Kushner has apparently forwarded this same email. Is he still -- is his security clearance still valid right now?\nMS. SANDERS: As always, we've never discussed the security clearances.\nQ: And, Sarah, just one more. Yesterday you said you'd check back to us on the status of how the President views the U.S.-Russia relationship. So can you update us? Is Russia a friend or foe?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I haven't had a chance to have that direct conversation. I've been a little preoccupied with other things, but I certainly will check on that, Zeke.\nMajor.\nQ: A policy question on Afghanistan and then something about the statement you just read. So has the President, through H.R. McMaster, notified the Pentagon that he is reasserting the cap of 3,900 additional troops to Afghanistan? Initially, it was reported that he had given the Pentagon, General Mattis, authority to increase the troop numbers in accordance with the strategy. It's now subsequently been reported that memos from H.R. McMaster said it's now limited at 3,900 and no more troops, regardless of the strategy. Can you tell us if that's true?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that specific memo, but I will check into the details of that and circle back.\nQ: Can you tell us how seriously the President considered the idea of using private contractors to augment U.S. personnel on the ground in Afghanistan as opposed to U.S. military personnel?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that we feel it's important to get input from all perspectives, and all of the right people were part of that process throughout, in any conversation. Look, we've used contractors extensively over the last 16 years. Currently, there are tens of thousands of contractors that are bravely serving alongside a lot of the U.S. military and coalition forces. And we're finalizing the review fully of the Afghanistan policy, and it only makes sense to consult those leaders in the field, as well. And that's simply just part of the review process.\nQ: When you say the right people, does that include Erik Prince?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, I meant from our inside, internally -- all of the right people would be part of that process in terms of national security team.\nQ: Can you confirm if Erik Prince part of the conversations about the contract?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't but -- I cannot at this time, but I'll check and let you know.\nQ: All right. And on the President's statement -- because you can talk about that, I would assume, since you read it to us -- what transparency is the President applauding?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe the willingness on behalf of everyone within the administration or anything beyond that --\nQ: But it's about Don Jr., right?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry. On any --\nQ: The statement is about Don Jr.\nMS. SANDERS: I know. I'm trying to finish my sentence, Major. And anyone beyond that that might be asked questions, the willingness to do so and to be fully transparent and open and answer any questions through the correct process, whether that is through the special counsel or anything beyond that.\nPeter.\nQ: Sarah, is the President aware, as he speaks about the transparency of his son, that he only released those emails after being informed that The New York Times was about to publish them?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, Peter. I'd have to check.\nQ: Let me ask you more broadly about what we spoke about yesterday on the topic of appropriateness in terms of campaigns. Explain to Americans, who are asking this question today, why it's appropriate for a presidential campaign to accept a meeting with a Russian national after being promised high-level and sensitive information presented as part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump. Explain to Americans why that would be appropriate.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get into the details of anything surrounding this, and would refer you to Don Jr.'s outside counsel.\nQ: Do you stand by your statement that it was --\nMS. SANDERS: I stand -- as I mentioned earlier, I stand by everything I said yesterday.\nSteven.\nQ: The Vice President, through his spokesman, said today that Mr. Pence is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket. That's been taken by many people in this town to suggest that there is a distance between the President and the Vice President on this. Is there such a distance?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. There's absolutely no distance between the President and the Vice President.\nQ: Do you know if the President has spoken to the Vice President about this?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if they've spoken directly about this, but I know they've spoken today.\nQ: One more question. There are lots of people who would like to know why this briefing was off-camera today. Do you have a rationale for it?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, I believe Sean stated back in December, we're always looking at different approaches and different ways to communicate the President's message and talk about the agenda. This is one of the many ways we choose to do that.\nJustin.\nQ: I'm going to take two bites out of this apple as well. The first is with the stock market.\nMS. SANDERS: Let's not break precedent.\nQ: The stock market sharply declined today on the release of the emails by Don Jr. And so I'm wondering if you're concerned that these revelations are going to impact the U.S. economy and if you want to offer any assurances to investors that see this news and they're obviously responding.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President, as he has been, not just since assuming office but throughout the campaign, is focused on doing everything he can to strengthen and grow our economy, and that certainly hasn't changed today nor will it at any point that he's President, Justin.\nQ: And then, to go back to the statement that you read, the President says that he applauds Don Jr.'s transparency. I'm wondering if you guys would (inaudible) now that he's disclosed any other meetings that happened between Russian nationals and members of the Trump campaign towards that transparency.\nMS. SANDERS: There's nothing that I'm aware of at this time.\nQ: Yesterday, you compared the meeting to Hillary Clinton's campaign coordination with Ukraine. Do you feel like coordinating with any -- all countries in the world are pretty much the same? That there's no difference between Ukraine or Russia or any other country?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it would depend on the nature. I mean, I can't speak about theoretical or hypothetical situations?\nQ: Okay. Well, just take Ukraine and Russia. Do you feel that they're equivalent?\nMS. SANDERS: In what way? They're very different countries. I'm not going to put them on an equivalent playing field across the board on any matter that could possibly come up.\nQ: Do you consider them both allies, partners of the United States, or adversaries? I mean, in what way are they similar? Because you compared them yesterday.\nMS. SANDERS: I was talking about the process, not the two countries. I was talking about the process that had been gone through by both sides. And that's all -- the point I was making.\nQ: Okay, but I thought you were saying if it was okay for Hillary to coordinate with Ukraine, then it should be okay -- or to meet with Ukraine about possible information that might be relevant on the campaign, it would be equally okay to meet with Russians about information they may have.\nMS. SANDERS: I was talking about simply the process and nothing beyond that.\nQ: You still think it was okay -- put aside the issue of collusion. Is it appropriate to meet with Russians about information they might have during that campaign?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said earlier, I stand by the comments I made yesterday.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two quick questions for you. Have you spoken with the President in the past 24 hours?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes.\nQ: What was his general reaction to story? Without getting into an official White House response to some of the questions earlier, did you speak with him about this story?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the President is, I would say, frustrated with the process of the fact that this continues to be an issue. And he would love for us to be focused on things, like Justin mentioned, the economy, on healthcare, on tax reform, on infrastructure. And that's the place that his mind is, and that's what he'd like to be discussing.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I have two questions as well. Senator Rubio said this morning that the entire matter involving Donald Trump, Jr. is, and I quote, \"Mueller territory.\" In other words, it should be left solely up to the special prosecutor. What's the White House reaction to that?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I would refer you to the outside special counsel, and I think that's something that they could work on together.\nQ: So you have no reaction to what Senator Rubio said?\nMS. SANDERS: No I don't, John.\nQ: My other question is about personnel. The President has -- and you pointed this out yesterday in the form you handed out -- numerous judicial vacancies to fill, including four on the controversial 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In an effort to speed this up, will the administration waive the blue slip process from senators or the opinion of the American Bar Association?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if those conversations have taken place about whether or not to waive that if it were to expedite, but I'll be happy to check into it for you.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks. I have three, but I'll try to be quick.\nMS. SANDERS: Three?\nQ: Secretary Mattis said a month ago that you guys would be rolling out the new Afghanistan strategy by mid-July. Does that still hold?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that the plan is to roll that out after there's been a full review process. I don't have anything beyond that at this point. I know they'd like to do that soon.\nQ: Okay. Be that as it may, what role does the President see for himself in terms of explaining the strategy to the American people? Does he plan a primetime address, does he plan a press conference, does he plan a national tour? How implicated do you think he will be in selling the new strategy to the public?\nMS. SANDERS: I think those things will be determined once the new strategy is finalized.\nQ: Last one. Whose decision was it to provide relatively limited answers today to the Don Jr. question? Is it a lawyer, or did White House Counsel instruct you not to do this? Is it a communications decision? Who made that decision?\nMS. SANDERS: As I told Zeke earlier, all the appropriate parties were part of the conversation and that decision was made internally.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. The administration missed its deadline to make a decision on steel tariffs. Can you give us an update on where that decision stands? Can we expect a decision this week?\nMS. SANDERS: The report and any recommendations within that report are going through normal interagency review process, and as soon as that's completed that will be released. Hopefully in short order.\nQ: Sarah, is there a reason that the deadline wasn't met?\nMS. SANDERS: It was a self-imposed deadline and they're working to get it through the final review process as quickly as possible.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. In the conversation that you had with the President, did he give an indication to you that these stories that we see come out day after day, in The New York Times specifically, are in any way self-inflicted? After all, it's the meeting that Don Jr. had with this Russian lawyer that has precipitated all of this.\nMS. SANDERS: No. And I think the President has made it pretty clear his position on this entire process.\nQ: When you have that conversation with the President, do you ask him -- just so you can speak with us and inform us -- do you say, what was the nature, from your understanding, Mr. President, about the conversation your son and these other two individuals had with this Russian lawyer?\nMS. SANDERS: I didn't have that type of conversation. The conversations I have -- the goal is to get information that I can best communicate to you guys, whether it's on healthcare or infrastructure or tax reform or any other matter. The way those conversations play out are going to vary from topic to topic.\nGo ahead. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: On sanctions, I wanted to ask: Is the White House suggesting or asking for new language to insert kind of a tweak to give the President the waivers -- the national security waivers -- that you're seeking? Or is the White House wanting to see the bill cancelled all together and killed all together?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said yesterday, the President is committed to maintaining the existing sanctions against Russia until Moscow reverses the aggressive actions against Ukraine that triggered the sanctions. And President Trump reaffirmed this position at the G20 last Friday. But this is more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate with other countries, and this includes working with allies and partners to present a united front to common foes. And we remain committed to working with Congress on those issues.\nQ: Thank you.\nQ: She called on -- can you call on me next, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure.\nQ: Thank you.\nQ: With Mosul now in Iraqi hands, does the President have a strategy for the future of Iraq or U.S. involvement in Iraq?\nMS. SANDERS: You know, those are continued conversations. And as we have announcements on it, we'll let you guys know.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah.\nQ: I'm going to take this one.\nMS. SANDERS: I promised I'd come to him.\nQ: Is President Trump now aware of the Russian government effort to influence the campaign in his favor?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Is the President now aware of the Russian government effort to influence the campaign in his favor?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to answer any questions on that matter.\nQ: And a follow-up on that. Yesterday, you were asked when the President learned of the Donald Jr. meeting, and your response was, \"I believe in the last couple of days is my understanding.\" Is there any reason that we should think that answer would change today? Have you learned anything new that would change your response there?\nMS. SANDERS: No I haven't. Thanks, guys, so much.\nEND 2:48 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127970", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Thornberry, R-TX, and Rep. Smith, D-WA)\nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's (Committee) continued work on behalf of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.\nThe bill supports key Administration priorities, including ending the defense sequester, rebuilding our military readiness, and modernizing our force for the future. It authorizes funding for our ongoing efforts to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to deter potential adversaries, and to bolster our allies. The bill also includes important reforms to Department of Defense (DOD) management and business practices, and the Administration looks forward to working with the Committee to continue finding efficiencies at DOD.\nThe bill authorizes $18.5 billion above the President's FY 2018 Budget request for base national defense spending, as well as an additional $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. The previous Administration enacted harmful cuts to defense spending, and this Administration strongly supports eliminating them. To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration strongly supports reductions to spending elsewhere in the Federal budget, as outlined in the President's FY 2018 Budget request.\nWhile the bill contains many promising reforms, it fails to authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, which would result in substantial recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force structure. The Administration is in the midst of conducting several strategic reviews that affect multiple provisions in this bill, such as those addressing space organization and management and naval ship force structure. Once these reviews are complete, the Administration will be prepared to suggest modifications to these provisions.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex and working with Congress to address any concerns about classified programs.\nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure Round: The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting scarce resources on unneeded infrastructure. The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save it an additional $2 billion annually—resources it could apply to higher priorities such as readiness and modernization.\nEstablishment of Space Corps in the Department of the Air Force: The Administration appreciates the Committee's concerns with the organization and management of DOD's space capabilities as reflected in section 1601, which calls for the establishment of a separate Space Corps within the Department of the Air Force. As the Secretary of Defense has testified, the Administration recognizes the criticality of our access to and use of space, and we understand the increasing threats posed to our continued use of space capabilities. As directed by the FY 2017 NDAA, the Administration is assessing a wide range of organizational options, including a Space Corps. The creation of a separate Space Corps, however, is premature at this time. Upon completion of these analyses, the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to implement military space organizational changes (while considering the budget implications) in a practical timeframe to best posture the Nation's joint forces to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.\nExtension and Modification of Authority to Provide Assistance to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria: The Administration appreciates the increased funding authority included in section 1222, but notes its concern that the provision does not contain additional requested authority for small-scale construction of temporary facilities that are necessary to meet operational needs and force protection requirements in both Iraq and Syria. As the campaign to defeat ISIS transitions beyond the liberation of Mosul and Raqqa, operational commanders will need the requested authority to build temporary intermediate staging facilities, ammunition supply points, and tactical assembly areas that have adequate force protection. These facilities, supply points, and assembly areas will enable the pursuit of ISIS into the Euphrates River Valley and help improve the security of Iraq's borders. Current authorities, limited only to repair and renovation of existing Iraqi facilities, severely limit the coalition's maneuverability and its ability to respond quickly to changing operational conditions.\nExtension and Modification of Authority to Support Operations and Activities of the Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq: The Administration appreciates the continuation of existing authority, but is disappointed by the lack of authority in section 1223 to expand the list of eligible recipients to include the \"military and other security forces of or associated with the Government of Iraq with a national security mission.\" The expanded authority would help address capability gaps, professionalization efforts, and defense institution building across the breadth of the Government of Iraq's (GoI's) national security institutions. By aiding the development of the GoI's most critical missions—counterterrorism, border security, and the protection of critical infrastructure—the expanded authority proposed by the Administration would help Iraqis prevent the emergence of a successor to ISIS, safeguard their nation's hard-fought gains, and guide their recovery from combat operations toward a more secure and stable nation.\nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Modernization and Sustainment of Assured Access to Space: The Administration strongly objects to section 1615, which would restrict development of new space launch systems, including those whose development is significantly funded by industry, in exclusive favor of rocket engines and modifications to existing launch vehicles. The provision limits domestic competition, which will increase taxpayer costs by several billions of dollars through FY 2027 and stifle innovation. It also ignores key recommendations of the Committee's independent panel of experts, who proposed broad funding at the launch-system level. The Administration's innovative, agile approach has already saved taxpayers $300 million and is the quickest path to delivering modern, domestic, cost-effective launch capabilities that will support national security requirements for decades to come. This provision would make the Administration's strategy impossible to execute, causing delays in transitioning from Russian engines and increased risks to continued assured access to space.\nIndustrial Base for Large Solid Rocket Motors and Related Technologies: The Administration strongly objects to section 1699, which would require the Secretary of Defense to pursue multiple sources for the various components of modern solid rocket missile systems. The large solid rocket motor industrial base has many single sources for components and materials. In many cases, the quantities of systems, subsystems, or components or materials acquired by DOD are not sufficient to support multiple suppliers. In addition, if a second source for these materials is required, it would trigger requalification on not only the rocket motor, but also the entire missile. This would be cost prohibitive to DOD, totaling nearly $1 billion.\nNotification Requirements for Sensitive Military Cyber Operations and Cyber Weapons: The Administration objects to section 1651, which would require the Secretary of Defense to notify the congressional defense committees within 48 hours about the conduct of sensitive military cyber operations and the results of any legal review by a military department of a cyber capability that is intended to be used as a weapon. DOD already regularly briefs the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services on major cyber operations. This provision would risk exposure, and potentially restrict use, of cyber capabilities; jeopardize foreign partnership cooperation; and impose additional, unwarranted administrative requirements on DOD.\nMisuse of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funds: The Administration is concerned by the use of OCO funds for items not related to contingency operations, including an additional $558 million for Israel missile defense funding. The bill also proposes using OCO to fund additional end strength, ships, and homeland defense. Funding these enduring requirements in OCO would complicate the funding stability for associated outyear costs and runs contrary to the purpose of OCO.\nDevelopment of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Range Ground-Launched Missile System: The Administration objects to sections 1244 and 1245, which would establish a program of record to develop a road-mobile, ground-launched cruise missile system and would purport to abrogate Article VI of the INF treaty. The Administration is currently developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy that maximizes pressure on Russia. It is also evaluating those military capabilities that are needed to protect our national security. This provision unhelpfully ties the Administration to a specific missile system, which would limit potential military response options. Section 1245(d) would also raise concerns among NATO allies and could deprive the Administration of the flexibility to make judgments about the timing and nature of invoking our legal remedies under the treaty. The Administration would support broad authorization of research and development on missile systems, including those prohibited by the treaty, to determine candidate systems that could become programs of record.\nLimitation on Availability of Funds Relating to Implementation of the Open Skies Treaty: The Administration objects to section 1235(b), which would prohibit the expenditure of funds for procurement for the Digital Visual Imaging System to modify the United States sensors and aircraft. This section will prevent the United States from keeping pace with Russian Open Skies aircraft sensor upgrades, fully implementing the Open Skies Treaty, and increasing the value of the treaty to United States national security. Cancellation of the project at this late date, after significant resources have already been expended, would further put the United States in breach of contract, thus incurring cancellation fees. The provision would result in limited or no cost savings and possibly a cost increase, which would be an unacceptable waste of taxpayer dollars.\nForeign Commercial Satellite Services: Cybersecurity Threats and Launches: The Administration strongly objects to section 1612, which would limit the Department's ability to procure satellite services from foreign entities. It also would prohibit entering into a contract for satellite services with any entity if such services will be provided using satellites launched from, or designed or manufactured in, a covered foreign country or by an entity controlled by the government of a covered foreign country, regardless of the location of the launch. For satellite communications services, three-quarters of services acquired today are from foreign-incorporated companies that make widespread use of international launch vehicles.\nCompensation Reform: The Administration objects to section 601, which would place restrictions on the President's authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed services. The President's FY 2018 Budget request provides the funding necessary to ensure servicemembers continue to receive an appropriate package of pay and benefits. The Administration, however, must balance this requirement against other investments critical to readiness, equipment, and modernization to ensure the military is the most capable warfighting force in the world. The Administration strongly encourages members of Congress to support its basic pay raise, TRICARE modernization, and pharmacy co-pay proposals, which would save $600 million in FY 2018 and $7.1 billion through FY 2022. Similarly, the Administration objects to section 604, which would prevent the Secretaries of the military departments from implementing a reduced per diem for uniformed servicemembers and civilian employees who travel to one location for more than 30 days. This provision is unnecessary because DOD has already implemented a policy allowing the services to pay travelers' actual expenses up to the full per diem rate when the reduced flat rate for meals and incidental expenses is insufficient for the assignment. If adopted, this section would add $56 million or more annually to DOD's travel costs.\nTRICARE Reform: The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not include the Administration's proposals to strengthen and improve the TRICARE benefit. The current system creates confusion and increases administrative costs because it provides separate benefits for members and retirees based on their dates of initial entry into military service. Vulnerable populations, including medically-retired members and their families, and survivors of those who died on active duty, also would be the first to pay increased costs under the new system. In addition, the Administration is concerned that the Committee did not include reasonable pharmacy co-pays. The Administration believes strongly that the President's FY 2018 Military Health System benefit reform package represents a reasonable and financially sound proposal for our beneficiaries. It protects vulnerable populations, eliminates a confusing and costly two-benefit program, and institutes reasonable pharmacy co-pays that will ensure TRICARE remains a generous, yet sustainable, health benefits program.\nLimitation on Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Modification Authority for Members of the Uniformed Services Residing in Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) Housing: The Administration objects to section 602, which would temporarily prohibit the Secretary of Defense from further reducing BAH below the current level for servicemembers residing in MHPI housing until 2019. This would create two classes of uniformed members: those who reside in privatized housing and receive a higher housing allowance and those who reside within the local community and receive a lower housing allowance. This is neither fair nor equitable since the opportunity to live in privatized housing on post is not always available. Administering this section would require an additional set of rates for members in privatized housing, necessitating challenging and costly modifications to military pay systems.\nClarification of Roles of Commanders of Military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and Surgeons General: Section 711 would designate each MTF commander as the individual responsible for the operation of the MTF they supervise. The Administration is concerned that this section would establish a potentially confusing organizational paradigm, as the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is also responsible for the management and administration of MTFs. The Secretary of Defense should be allowed to determine the most effective management structure for the Military Health System.\nUnobligated Balances Reductions: The Administration objects to the $1.3 billion reduction for unobligated balances across multiple appropriations. The reductions would only be applied to those programs funded in sections 4301, 4401, and 4501, which include military pay and allowances, military health care, readiness training, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items. These reductions would delay the DOD's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at the services' depot facilities.\nPerformance of Incurred Cost Audits: The Administration objects to multiple provisions in section 802. Mandating the acceptance of the claimed costs in their entirety if audit findings are not issued within one year of proposal receipt, restricting the use of multi-year audits, mandating that an arbitrary 25 percent of incurred costs be audited by qualified private auditors in lieu of a data-driven process, and mandating materiality thresholds will result in significant inefficiencies in the DOD audit process and result in significant unallowable costs being paid to contractors. Further, the materiality thresholds are significantly more prescriptive and detailed than defined in commercial or Government audit standards and are not risk-based.\nMissile Defense Programs: The Administration objects to section 1686, which would require the Secretary of Defense to ensure that anti-air warfare capabilities are deployed at the Aegis Ashore site in Romania by no later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, and at the Aegis Ashore site in Poland no later than one year after the declaration of operational status at that site. The accelerated timeline would require DOD to field an unproven defensive system without full knowledge of its combat effectiveness or the unintended consequences of operating a high-powered radar and weapon system in a populated area surrounding Deveselu, Romania. The diplomatic requirements to coordinate these issues with other nations are significant, even after proving the system and understanding the consequences of the system on local populations. In addition, the Administration strongly objects to section 1685, which would mandate a flight test of the SM-3 Block IIA missile against an ICBM class threat within 270 days of enactment.\nReinstatement of Requirement to Preserve Certain C-5 Aircraft: The Administration strongly objects to section 143, which would require the Air Force to maintain at least 25 C-5A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP)-modified aircraft in flyable storage. The Air Force currently has 52 C-5Ms within its total strategic aircraft inventory. Requiring the maintenance of an additional 25 C-5As in flyable condition would eliminate the relief provided in the FY 2017 NDAA from the FY 2013 NDAA requirement to keep retired C-5As in flyable storage. The total estimated cost to regenerate 25 C-5A AMP aircraft into flyable condition would exceed $5.6 billion, not including aircrew and maintenance training costs, and would take an estimated nine years to complete.\nLimitation on Expenditure of Funds for Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses for Intelligence and Counterintelligence Activities and Representation Allowances: While the Administration understands the Committee's concern with the use of these funds and will thoroughly examine this practice, the Administration objects to section 1031, which would prohibit using Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses authority for recurring expenses and lower the congressional notification threshold for intelligence and counterintelligence activities. These changes would severely impede DOD's ability to conduct intelligence and counterintelligence operations and negatively affect ongoing counterterrorism and other critical DOD operations.\nOpen Discovery Rule: The Administration shares Congress' goal of preventing sexual assault in the military and holding accountable those who commit the offense. Although the Administration is sympathetic to the motivation behind section 524, affording victim's counsel with open file discovery may have the unintended consequence of impairing the successful prosecution of cases by creating additional opportunities for the defense to challenge the victim's testimony. In addition, the Administration encourages Congress to consider whether the information required by section 528 is already provided in annual Family Advocacy Program reports.\nModernization of Army Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS): The Administration objects to section 1683, which would direct the Secretary of the Army to issue an acquisition strategy no later than April 15, 2018, for a 360-degree lower tier air and missile defense sensor that achieves initial operational capability by January 1, 2022, and completes fielding to all Army units by January 1, 2026. The requirements and timelines in this provision are not feasible. They would prevent the Army from developing LTAMDS integrally as part of its phased modernization approach for integrated air and missile defense based on Army and Joint Staff validated requirements. Additionally, the Administration opposes the provision's direction to transfer the acquisition responsibility of the sensor to the Missile Defense Agency should the Army not issue the strategy in time.\nIssues for Relocation of Marines to Guam: The Administration appreciates the inclusion of section 1062, which would authorize the admission before October 1, 2020, of H-2B workers coming to Guam to perform certain military-related work or as health care workers under modified admission requirements. The Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt the Administration's request, which would, among other things, extend the authority through December 31, 2023, and address specified needs in both Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (the CNMI). The Department of the Navy's current workload projections indicate that approximately 2,300 H-2B workers would be required to supplement the Guam or CNMI workforce on military build-up construction projects. Without additional H-2B workers, limited access to construction workers would harm our ability to relocate Marines to Guam on planned timelines. This could be a factor in meeting the commitment of the United States to return land to Japan.\nIn addition, the Administration objects to section 2822, which provides for the land conveyance of the Naval Ship Repair Facility, Guam. The property is not excess to the needs of the Department of the Navy, as Military Sealift Command awarded a contract for ship repair that will require use of this property. Opening this property to commercial use also would pose security concerns to nearby berthed Navy vessels, including the Department of the Navy losing control of whether the commercial entity can perform work on foreign vessels.\nPalau: The Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts in section 1265 to fund the 2010 United States-Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), but is disappointed that the Committee did not include the provision requested provision that would approve the 2010 CRA. As a sovereign and freely associated state in the western Pacific, the Republic of Palau carries significant foreign policy and national security significance for the United States. Congressional approval is required for the United States to enter into the CRA and modify the CRA's funding schedule as necessary for the United States to meet its international commitments. Failure to approve the CRA could imperil ongoing national security initiatives with the Republic of Palau and destabilize United States access and influence in a region that is increasingly contested by China.\nMixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration strongly objects to section 3119 directing construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility. The Administration appreciates the flexibility provided to the Secretary of Energy to waive that requirement and terminate the MOX project. The MOX project is unaffordable and risky, with $12 billion in remaining construction costs, based on the most recent estimate prepared in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy. The project would bring total construction costs to $17 billion, when including $5 billion in sunk-costs to date. In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two decades. The Administration supports the Committee's recommendation to authorize funds for the Savannah River Site's (SRS) dilute and dispose capability to remove from South Carolina, and dispose of, surplus plutonium stored at SRS. Dilute and dispose is a proven approach with significantly less risk and expense, and it can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach.\nIncremental Funding for National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) New Campus West (N2W): The Administration appreciates the support for NGA's N2W facility, but objects to the proposed incremental funding approach. The authorized level in the bill could lead to higher total project costs, delay the delivery of the campus, and negatively impact other mission-critical priorities.\nConstitutional Concerns: Certain provisions in this bill raise constitutional concerns. These include, for example, sections 1232 and 921(b). Section 1232 would interfere with the President's exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations, and section 921(b) would contravene the Appointments Clause by authorizing incumbent officials to serve in new offices without further appointments.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns as this legislation advances.", "timestamp": "2017-07-11", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 2810 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018"}

The order also changes from July 12, 2017, to October 12, 2017, the effective date for the revocation of sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, provided that the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, publishes on or before October 12, 2017, a notice in the Federal Register stating that the Government of Sudan has sustained the positive actions that gave rise to the order and has provided to the President the report described above.\nThe order revokes the requirement in Executive Order 13761 to provide an updated version of the report annually thereafter and, concurrent with those reports, to publish in the Federal Register a notice stating whether the Government of Sudan has sustained the positive actions that gave rise to Executive Order 13761.\nThe President issued Executive Orders 13067 and 13412, among other orders, to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, including support for international terrorism; efforts to destabilize neighboring governments; and the prevalence of human rights violations.\nIn Executive Order 13761, the President determined that the situation that gave rise to the actions taken in Executive Order 13067 and Executive Order 13412 related to the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan had been altered by Sudan's positive actions over the prior 6 months. Executive Order 13761 directed the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and based on a consideration of relevant and credible information from available sources, including nongovernmental organizations, on or before July 12, 2017, to provide a report to the President on the Government of Sudan's progress in sustaining its positive actions that gave rise to Executive Order 13761. Executive Order 13761 further provided that if the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, published on or before July 12, 2017, a notice in the Federal Register stating that the Government of Sudan had sustained the positive actions that gave rise to Executive Order 13761 and had provided to the President the report described above, the revocation of sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the revocation of Executive Order 13412 would become effective.\nWhile the Government of Sudan has made some progress in areas identified in Executive Order 13761, I have decided that more time is needed for this review to establish that the Government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action across all of those areas.\nFor these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to amend the effective date to October 12, 2017, to provide the report required by Executive Order 13761 and revoke sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and Executive Order 13412, provided that further action is taken by the Secretary of State, as set forth in Executive Order 13761, and to revoke the subsequent annual reporting requirement in Executive Order 13761.\nI am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126645", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Kentucky! (Applause.) Thank you so very much for coming out on this balmy summer day.\nIt is great to be back in the Bluegrass State. And I bring greetings from my friend, the man Kentucky voted overwhelmingly to make the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President sent me here today to thank you all, thank the good people of Kentucky for your unwavering support. And I promise you, you elected a fighter. You elected a winner. And no matter what issue the media may be focused on, on any given moment, I promise you, President Donald Trump will never stop fighting for the issues that matter most to the people of Kentucky and the people all across this country. (Applause.)\nAnd, man, have you got a great governor in Governor Matt Bevin. (Applause.) Governor Bevin, thanks for that kind introduction. I can honestly say I was for Matt Bevin before it was cool. (Laughter.) And I just have to tell you, Governor, you have just done such an incredible job here, changing the fortunes and the future of the Bluegrass State. Give Governor Matt Bevin another round of applause, will you? He's doing an awesome job. (Applause.)\nI also want to say thanks to a couple of other great Kentucky public servants who are here with us today. You just heard from both of them. These are two leaders in Congress who I promise you have been strong conservative voices and strong partners for President Donald Trump -- Congressman Andy Barr and Congressman Brett Guthrie. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your outstanding leadership. (Applause.)\nAnd last but not least, I want to thank you to Terry Bryant and the whole Bryant's Rent-All team for opening up this successful business to us today. (Applause.)\nYou know, Bryant's Rent-All is a real American success story. And I'm just glad to hear Terry tell them that they're now on the map as of this event today.\nBut you've been on the map for a long time, Terry. Truth be told. This has been a family-owned business for more than 60 years. In fact, three generations of Bryants have helped grow this business from its humble roots to a party and equipment rental powerhouse here in the Bluegrass State. Let's give them one more round of applause for welcoming us and for all they do to contribute to the prosperity of this community. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I both know just how important small businesses like this one are to America, to jobs and a growing economy. Small businesses like this and those represented here today so well are the beating heart of communities large and small -- creating jobs and opportunities. And small businesses are out there contributing to every worthy cause that comes along in each community.\nJust know that today your President is grateful for what you do, each and every day. And let me make these job creators who are with us a promise: President Donald Trump will be the best friend American small businesses will ever have. (Applause.)\n? Just look at the record. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, since the start of this year, American businesses have created more than 800,000 good-paying jobs all across the United States.\nCompanies large and small are making extraordinary investments all across America, billions of dollars, thousands of new jobs. And small businesses like Bryant's Rent-All haven't been this confident about the future in more than a decade.\nAnd truth be told, you should be confident. Because since day one of this administration, President Trump has been taking decisive action to deliver on the promises that he made to the people of Kentucky and people all across this country.\nAs I speak to you today, President Trump has signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.) We've already saved businesses and working families up to $18 billion a year in red tape costs.\nThe President put American energy first when he authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines to get American energy flowing to American homes and business. (Applause.)\nAnd every day, this President puts America first -- just like last month, when President Donald Trump announced to the world that this administration had made the decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Paris climate accord. (Applause.)\n? It's remarkable to think the Paris accord, by one estimate, could have cost America 6.5 million jobs over the next 25 years, while letting countries like China and India virtually scot-free. But as our President said, he was elected by the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris. And I'll add of Lexington, not Lisbon. This President will always put America first. (Applause.)\nAnd speaking of Europe, at this very moment we're seeing the bold leadership of an American President on the world stage, President Donald Trump has been showing the world that we once again have an American President who stands without apology as the leader of the free world. (Applause.)\nToday as we speak, the President is accepting an invitation from President Macron in France. He's departing in just a few short hours to mark the 100th anniversary of the entry of American forces onto French soil during World War One.\nAnd last week, the President concluded a historic trip to Poland and Germany -- and his speech in Warsaw was one for the ages. Wasn't it?\nIn this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats, President Trump challenged all who cherish freedom to in his words, work together to confront the forces that threaten to undermine our values, erase the bonds of culture, faith, and the tradition that make us who we are.\n? And President Donald Trump declared to all of the world and all who would threaten our way of life, \"the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.\" (Applause.)\nFolks, that's what American leadership looks like on the world stage. And serving with him every day, I know: President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people.\nAs the proud father of a United States Marine, I couldn't be more proud -- thank you -- I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces, their families, and our veterans.\nEarlier this week, I pause right now with a heavy heart, my wife and I awakened as all of you did to learn that 15 Marines and one Navy corpsman had perished in a plane crash in Mississippi. The President called it \"heartbreaking,\" and his prayers, his family's prayers, and my little family's prayers, along with all of you are for these heroes and their families and their loved ones. When heroes fall, America grieves. And we honor and remember the families of those fallen in Mississippi this week.\nBut rest assured: President Donald Trump is fighting every day to give our men and women in uniform the resources and support they deserve. I'm pleased to report this President has already signed the biggest increase in defense spending in nearly 10 years. (Applause.)\nAnd in the President's budget he called for the greatest investment in military readiness since the days of President Ronald Reagan. Under President Donald Trump, we will rebuild our military. We will restore the arsenal of democracy, and we will once again give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they deserve to accomplish their mission and come home safe. That's our pledge. (Applause.)\nAnd under the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief, I'm proud to report our armed forces are taking the fight to the enemy on our terms, on their soil. And just this week American forces helped Iraqi forces liberate Mosul from the grip of ISIS, and as the President said today, ISIS is on the run and we'll wipe them out soon -- all the way to Raqqa. (Applause.)\nWhen it comes to homeland security, as well, President Trump had taken decisive steps to secure our borders, enforce our laws, and remove dangerous gang members and drug dealers from our streets. Under President Donald Trump, I'm proud to report illegal crossings at our southern border are down by more than 60 percent since the start of this year. (Applause.)\nAnd working with local law enforcement, our Justice Department is busy removing dangerous MS-13 gang members from the streets of our cities.\nSo it's about prosperity. It's about security. It's about strengthening America at home and abroad. President Donald Trump has done all that and more -- and it's only been six months, folks.\n? But as our President likes to say in the Oval Office where I just with him this morning that's what we call a good start in the Trump White House. (Applause.)\nThe truth is we've got a lot more work to do. And I came here today to assure you, I came here today to turn up the heat on a promise that every Republican made to the American people and this President made to the American people and tell you that we will keep our promise to all of you. And before the summer is out, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nYou all remember the broken promises they made to get Obamacare passed. I just talked about them with job creators from across the Lexington area. Remember? They said if you like your doctor you could keep them -- not true. They said if you like your health insurance you could keep it. Tens of thousands in Kentucky have found out the hard way -- not true. We were told that health insurance costs would go down.\nNow we know the facts. Here in Kentucky, the average premium on the individual market has spiked by a staggering 75 percent just in the past four years. Now President Obama and all those that advocated Obamacare promised us that you would save up to $2,500 per year if Obamacare became law. The Governor just mentioned that statistic today. But today instead of the average American saving $2,500 a year, average Obamacare premium costs are $2,000 more today than they were just in 2013.\nAnd the truth is it's only getting worse. Working families in Kentucky are facing double-digit premium hikes heading into 2018. And while costs are skyrocketing, choices are plummeting.\nI heard it from these job creators who we just had a conversation with today. The truth is right now a third of American counties, including five whole states, have only one choice of Obamacare insurer -- meaning they essentially have no choice at all.\nAnd come next year, 40 percent of American counties are expected to be in the same situation -- including nine entire states. Even worse, tens of thousands of Americans may have no Obamacare coverage whatsoever.\nChoices are declining because health insurers as you've seen here in Kentucky are abandoning this failed law left and right.\nOn Monday our administration actually announced that the number of health insurers who plan even on participating in Obamacare in 2018 has dropped nearly in half in just the last two years. And it's likely that even more will drop out between now and the end of this year.\nJust look at what's happening right here in Kentucky. Next year, nearly 50 percent of the Bluegrass State -- 59 out of your 120 Kentucky counties -- will have only one insurer to choose from on the state exchange.\nKentucky is a case study of Obamacare's failure. And the remarkable thing is that many states have it even worse than Kentucky does.\nFolks, we're talking about real people facing a real crisis. I never want to forget, as we remember these statistics -- and you have to cite the statistics to be able to reflect on the magnitude of the failure of Obamacare. But behind every number is a name. Behind every statistic is a story of real Americans and real businesses that are struggling. I've heard these stories as I've traveled all across this country -- from working families, single moms, and parents with disabled children who've suffered under the burden of Obamacare.\nJust a few moments ago, I heard from Terry Bryant and other small-business owners from Kentucky about how Obamacare has stifled their business and hurt their employees.\nI took a few notes as I was talking to them -- people like\nJulie Roberts with Servpro. She's got about 40 employees. Since 2010, she told me that the average premiums per-employee per-month had gone up from $36 a month to $109 a month, and worse still, while the cost of her health insurance had gone up for her employees, the deductibles have increased from $1,500 to about $4,000.\nI heard from a local hotel business owner who explained to me that while he was thinking about building a couple more hotels, creating lots of new, good-paying jobs, creating lots of great construction jobs and all the ancillary investments that go with expansion here in the Lexington area -- because of Obamacare, and Obamacare alone, and the cost of health insurance, he was holding off. Well, I told him today: Help is on the way. Go ahead and break ground. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare with your help. (Applause.)\nFolks, the truth is as I talk to these small business owners, it's the same story I hear all across the country. Despite the people who go on television one after another and say that Obamacare just needs a little fix here and there, the truth is that Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go.\nYou'd have to be a politician blinded by partisanship to believe otherwise. Unfortunately Congress is full of them. The truth is -- and it's a hard truth -- the very same politicians who gave us Obamacare now won't lift a finger to help the American people out from under its collapsing weight. In fact, they're claiming that Obamacare is working.\nI mean, Democrats in Congress would rather let Obamacare continue to implode than admit their mistake and help Republican majorities rescue the American people from this failed policy. But I'm here to promise you they won't stop us. Because President Donald Trump and the leadership in the Congress will not rest. We will not relent until we rescue the people of Kentucky and all across America from Obamacare. (Applause.)\nAnd I got to tell you folks, I got to tell you folks: I'm standing here in the heat -- you are too -- but I'll give you a word of encouragement: We are very close to achieving what we've talked about for the last seven years. The House of Representatives has already done its job, and give another round of applause to Congressman Guthrie and Congressman Barr from stepping up. Stepping up and keeping their promise to the people of Kentucky. (Applause.)\nBut now the Senate is going to work. Thanks to the leadership of Kentucky's own Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, tomorrow the Senate will release an updated bill that will begin the end of Obamacare. (Applause.) Voting could start as early as next week so I need you to stay tuned, and I need you to stay engaged.\nLet me just take a word and say the President and I couldn't be more grateful for Senator Mitch McConnell's leadership and commitment to an agenda that will make America great again. (Applause.) He's doing a great job. And the President and I want to commend Leader McConnell's decision to keep the Senate in session through the first two weeks of August until they get the job done. (Applause.)\nWith the support of the leadership of Senator McConnell, we've rolled back red tape. We confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Applause.) And under his leadership and the help of Kentucky's other senator, we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nNow let me say from my heart, the President and I really like Senator Rand Paul. I've known him for a lot of years. He's a man of principle and conviction. Senator Rand Paul is a great conservative and a great legislator, and he does Kentucky proud. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say as this debate begins, the debate on the floor of the Senate begins next week, the amendments begin -- an important amendment to move this bill forward. The President and I believe when the time comes, Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul will do the right thing together, and we will pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and end the Obamacare nightmare once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd let me promise you the bill before the United States Senate does just that. Plain and simple, this bill begins the process of repealing and replacing this failed policy. Here's a couple of for instances: This legislation puts American healthcare back on the path to freedom -- more choices, more affordable. This bill will repeal Obamacare's mandates and taxes on the American people and American businesses and restore freedom and create jobs all across this nation. (Applause.) I just heard about it.\nThis legislation will expand health savings accounts and offer tax credits to help every American buy the coverage you need at a price you afford. It will ensure that every American with preexisting conditions has access to the coverage and the care that you need -- no exceptions. And this bill improves and strengthens Medicaid for the people who need it most with better coverage, better care, and better outcomes that Governor Bevin and your state legislature can decide to meet Kentucky's unique needs the Kentucky way. That's what we're going to have when we repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nI'll never forget being here for Governor Bevin's inaugural address. When he actually called me out from the podium, he announced his intention to reform Medicaid -- I was governor of Indiana at the time. He said he was going to base it on some of the conservative principles we used in Indiana when I was governor. And then he did a little bit of trash-talking. (Laughter.) He said he was pretty sure Kentucky could do a better job than Indiana. Well, I tell you what, President Trump and I are going to make sure that he has the chance to try Kentucky solutions for the most vulnerable in Kentucky. That's how we'll reform and improve Medicaid. (Applause.)\nThe Senate bill and the House bill that passed before it gives states like Kentucky all the freedom and flexibility that your governor will need to reform Medicaid and meet the real needs of your most vulnerable.\nI just talked to a very inspiring mom. She happens to be a business owner. She runs Remedy Intelligent Staffing, but Lynn Braker is here. She told us a story about the cost of Obamacare and then she broke and she started to brag about her boy Anderson. And Anderson is a Down syndrome boy, and you could tell he's the light of her life. The truth of the matter is I said to her that when we give states the flexibility to reform Medicaid, we're going to be able to make sure that states like Kentucky can focus Medicaid resources on those who need it most. I just told Lynn, I had some families out in Washington -- I met a mom of a special needs child from Illinois and she told me that after Illinois expanded traditional Medicaid the way that Kentucky did years ago, she got a notice from the state of Illinois that said that medicine that her special needs son had received before that had been paid for by the state of Illinois' Medicaid program would no longer be paid.\nI mean, men and women, it's what the Governor just said a minute ago. Medicaid was formed for the aged, the blind, the disabled, for people with special needs, for dependent children. Once we give states like Kentucky the ability to reform Medicaid the Kentucky way once again, we're going to make sure that Lynn and her wonderful son Anderson have the support that they need to have the quality of life and the healthcare that every person in Kentucky wants them to have. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I believe in state-based solutions and state-based reforms. The bottom line is the Senate bill is going to do just that. It will end the Obamacare nightmare, it will begin to replace it with a healthcare system that's built on individual responsibility, free-market principles and state-based innovation.\nBut I came here today to turn up the heat because this is the moment. Now is the time. It's time for Congress to step up and repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nFor the past seven years, we've had a healthcare system based on the flawed premise that the federal government could order every American to buy health insurance, whether they want it or need it or not -- that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. and politicians know better than patients and doctors. And worst of all, that the American people can't be trusted to run their own lives and make their own healthcare choices without the heavy hand of government.\nNow we have a chance before us in days, maybe weeks, but not months, to restore a healthcare system based on the time-honored American principles of personal responsibility and state-based reform. And above all else, we have a chance to restore a healthcare system based on the ultimate American principle of freedom by giving Americans more freedom to buy health insurance the way we buy life insurance, the way we buy car insurance. As we'll ultimately do when we move all the legislation that we have to move, we're going to lower the cost of health insurance with more competition, with more choices, with more state-based innovation and reform. That's the American way to meet healthcare needs in the 21st century. (Applause.)\nThis legislation is the beginning, and once we sign this legislation into law, get ready, there's more to come. And the President and I are going to continue to work with this Congress to expand the choices that Americans have to purchase health insurance.\nAs soon as we repeal and replace Obamacare, make no mistake about it -- next stop, with the strong support of these members of Congress, we're going to get this economy moving by cutting taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. (Applause.) And we're going to cut taxes on businesses so companies like Bryant's Rent-All and all those represented here can compete with companies around the world to create jobs here in Kentucky. (Applause.)\nSo we've got a lot of work to do, everybody. And time is a wasting, and this is where you come in. President Trump and I are counting on all of you. This is the moment. Now is the time for the Congress to act, but this also the time for your moment. We need you to stand up and speak out. Let your voices be heard to our elected representatives.\nIf you haven't noticed, the other side is certainly showing up for the debate, and it's their every right. That's what freedom looks like. But we need people who know we can do better than Obamacare to let their voices be heard. Send an email, pick up the phone, let your elected representatives know the real story of Obamacare that we heard from these business owners today. Tell them that we can do better. Tell them that we can put America back on a path to prosperity, opportunity, and freedom.\nBut it's going to take courage, and it's going to take leadership in Washington, D.C. And make no mistake about it, there are many voices in our Nation's Capital, and you see them on TV all the time. But there is no more compelling voice in Washington, D.C. than the voice of the American people. So let your voice be heard. (Applause.)\nAnd there's one more thing that I might ask you to do if you're of a mind: In these too divided times, I would urge you to do what Americans have done throughout our history, in much more challenging times than this. If you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee, it's a good time to do it. Whether we look at the disarray on the world stage, whether we look at the divisions and the challenges here at home, the burden of failed policies and the struggling economy, it would be a good time to remember -- it would be a good time to remember our nation in your prayers.\nNow I'm not talking about -- as I close here, I'm not really talking about praying for a cause or praying for an agenda even. I rather like what Abraham Lincoln said in his time when he was asked in a great national struggle in which the nation was gripped throughout the Lincoln administration. He was asked if he thought God was on the side of the Union Army, and our 16th President simply said, you know my concern is not so much whether God is on our side, but whether we're on God's side. So pray for America. Pray for this country that we're blessed to call home. Because America matters far beyond our shores. (Applause.)\nSo, folks, I'm going to let you get back to somewhere where it's a little cooler. (Laughter.) And I'm going to let you get to work. Because I didn't come here just to talk and you didn't come here just to listen. You came here to do the work. I promise you, President Trump and I are absolutely dedicated, along with these great elected officials at every level, to keep the promises we made to the American people.\nAnd if all of us do all that we can, I believe in all of my heart, with boundless faith in the American people, and with faith in Him that put this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, together, we will make America safe again. Together, we will make America prosperous again. And, to borrow a phrase: Together, we will Make America Great Again.\nThank you very much. God bless you. God bless Kentucky, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-07-12", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on Obamacare in Lexington, Kentucky"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126654", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so very much for that warm welcome. Thank you, Skyler, for that gracious introduction. And let's give Skyler another round of applause for all the great work she's done organizing this great event. (Applause.)\nIt's really great to be here today at American University to address a rising generation of leaders in America. Give yourselves a round of applause. You are the future. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say on behalf of the First Family and on behalf of my little family, welcome to Washington, D.C. It's an honor to be with you today to really address what I know is a distinguished gathering of outstanding students from all across America and really across the wider world -- the National Student Leadership Conference, a legacy of leadership of which you are now a part. Let's hear it for the whole organization. Shall we? (Applause.)\nBut before I get started this morning, I wanted to bring greetings from my friend, who is a champion -- a champion for dreaming big dreams and for this next generation, who's fighting every single day for a boundless American future, the President of the United States of America -- I bring greetings from President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nIt's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who literally embodies American leadership. I told the President I was going to be with you when we spoke earlier today, and he just wanted me to pass along his congratulations and his encouragement to each and every one of you that are stepping forward and developing yourselves to be leaders in a broad range of areas so vital to our nation's life.\nYou know, 30 years ago, our President wrote a book that holds words of wisdom for all future leaders that are gathered here today. It really is a book that's inspired many leaders over more than three decades, and I believe it could be an inspiration to each one of you, as well.\nThe book is entitled \"The Art of the Deal,\" and it's actually an American classic. In that famous book, President Trump said, \"I like thinking big,\" because \"if you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\"\nAnd that's exactly what our President has done throughout his life. He's thought big. He's achieved big, and today we have a President of the United States who's literally lived the American Dream.\nIt's remarkable to think that our President, a grandson of an immigrant to this country, the son of a self-made businessman has lived the life that he's lived and now finds himself in the Oval Office of the United States.\nIt's interesting -- I often tell people that our two family stories are somewhat similar. The President's grandfather immigrated to this country, and my grandfather immigrated to this country from Ireland. His father was a self-made man who built a business with his own two hands. My dad built a small gasoline station business in a small town in southern Indiana. He, the man who calls himself \"the Kid from Queens,\" decided to build on that legacy, and he went to Manhattan Island to build the big buildings.\nFor my part, like so many of you, I felt a calling into public service. I followed that calling all throughout my life.\nI like to say that other than a whole lot of zeroes, the President and I have a lot in common. (Laughter.)\nAnd that's a belief in the American Dream -- because we've both lived it. We've benefitted by it. It's not a slogan or a bumper sticker at our house. Truthfully, that Irish immigrant, Richard Michael Cawley, is why Michael Richard Pence stands before you today as the 48th Vice President of the United States. That Irishman's brogue still rings in my heart and in my ears. And the President shares that same passion for his legacy.\nWe both have that passion to ensure that the American Dream is open to everyone with the courage and determination to achieve it. And I know that applies to every single one of you in this room.\nWe have no doubt that all of you here today are people that are going to live the American Dream. I'm confident you'll live lives of accomplishment, lives of consequence. We know that you'll lead your communities, your enterprises, your families, and our nation with distinction in the years ahead. So on the President's behalf, let me congratulate all of you for being nominated and selected to be at the National Student Leadership Conference. Give yourselves one more round of applause. You're all leaders. (Applause.)\nAnd this is a great conference. For more than 25 years, the National Student Leadership Conference has brought together the best and brightest, high school students from across the country and the wider world to experience a college education here at American University, explore your college interests and your career interests, learn the leadership skills that will benefit not just yourselves but your communities, your country, and the wider world.\nIt's remarkable to think about the reach of this conference. Tens of thousands of students have participated in these events, coming from not only across America, from more than 70 countries all across the globe.\nThis summer alone, your peers have traveled to 11 other American universities and colleges to study some 20 fields, ranging from business and entrepreneurship, to engineering, to architecture.\nAnd the nearly 300 of you who are gathered here this morning -- and I understand you arrived pretty early. Sorry about that. (Laughter.) All of you gathered here are devoted to public service, which makes it particularly humbling and inspiring for me to be with you today -- delving into the realms of political action, public policy, national security, intelligence, and the vital area of international diplomacy.\nThe National Student Leadership Conference is preparing you -- I promise you -- to excel in these areas in your college education and beyond, and I know with confidence that America and the world will be better for it. You're here to study leadership and that's a noble calling.\nAs the Old Book tells us, whoever aspires to be a leader, desires a noble task. And I want to tell each and every one of you, you couldn't have picked a better time to study leadership, to study leadership at the intersection of public policy and diplomacy and national security. At this very moment in this country, we're witnessing history in the making. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, we're in the midst of a great national renewal. We're seeing a return of security and prosperity to our nation and to our people.\nIn a word, I believe we're living through the restoration of America in its rightful role as leader of the free world. At this very moment, we're seeing the bold leadership of an American President on the world stage.\nA little bit later today, at the invitation of President Macron, the President will return to Europe once again -- second time in two weeks. He'll head to France to mark the 100th anniversary of the entry of American troops onto French soil during World War One.\nAnd just last week, as many of you witnessed, our President made a historic trip to Europe. Standing in Krasinski Square in Warsaw, Poland, the President spoke to the people of Poland, and really, to all people around the world who cherish freedom. As the President said, the Western world is united in our dedication to the values of individual freedom and sovereignty, and the President called on our allies all across the West to, in his words, \"a renewed commitment of will\" to, again in his words, to confront forces that threaten over time to undermine our values, erase the bonds of culture, faith, and tradition that make us who we are.\nI would say, ladies and gentleman, to all of you gathered here today: Those words in Poland last week, that's what American leadership looks like.\nServing with him every day, I know President Trump will continue to provide that leadership at home and abroad. This President has no higher priority than the security and safety of the American people and our prosperity.\nOn the security front, our President has taken decisive action to protect our nation in this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats. As the President actually said this morning, because of the efforts of our forces in the Middle East -- in Iraq and in Syria -- ISIS is on the run, will soon be wiped out in Syria and Iraq. And here at home, security is on the increase. I'm pleased to report that illegal border crossings are already down by more than 75 percent at our southern border, and the dangerous MS-13 gangs are being removed from our streets and our cities for the betterment and security of our families.\nOur President has been enforcing our laws, securing our borders. And in the midst of that, he's been rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy. And he's reaffirmed America's commitment to our time-honored alliances -- last week and before in his travels to Europe -- renewing our commitment to our critical transatlantic alliance and renewing our commitment to nations across the Asian Pacific.\nOur President though, however, knows that security begins -- or that security really is the foundation of our prosperity, and that's why for America, for our allies, and across the wider world and home, we are going to continue to advance the kind of policies that will promote prosperity and a stronger and more prosperous America.\nSince the first day of this administration, our President and our entire team have been working to get our economy moving again and put America back to work. And I'm pleased to report to all of you that will be entering the job market, really before you know it, that because of the President's vision, America is once again growing as it hasn't for quite a while.\nOptimism is reflected from record-setting gains in the stock market, to investments, to just last month alone, new jobs created at a level far outpacing what was expected. America's economy is coming back, and that's going to give us the opportunity to meet our obligations and to achieve our aspirations.\nAn America where entrepreneurship thrives and innovation flourishes is the America that this President believes in and is fighting to advance. President Trump's vision is an America where anyone, no matter who they are, no matter where they come from, regardless of race or creed or color or background, can climb the ladder of prosperity. In a word: Each one of you have chosen a very good time to be beginning your careers and graduating from high school in just a few short years.\nOur President has laid out a bold vision for greater security and greater prosperity, and that's the America you're going to be stepping in and rising as leaders. The President has been working on the prosperity front to lower taxes on working families and American businesses, to eliminate burdensome regulations, rebuilding infrastructure, unleashing our nation's energy resources, ensuring the trade deals are free and fair, and the President is going to keep his promise to repeal the failed policies known as Obamacare and give your generation a healthcare system based on individual freedom, consumer choice, and state-based reform.\nThanks to President Trump's leadership, looking out across this room, I truly believe and am absolutely confident that America's future is brighter than ever before. And this matters greatly to all of you gathered here because you are the future leaders who will guide our nation to even greater heights. You're here at the National Student Leadership Conference because you feel the call to public service, which I can relate to, because I felt it from very early in my life.\nSome of you may pursue a career in Foreign Service or an administrative agency. Some of you may enter into the intelligence community, some of you may even run for office yourself -- in your hometown, your home state, or even run for office here in our Nation's Capital. But while your paths may all be different, the same call of leadership falls on each of your shoulders.\nAnd so as I close this morning, let me share a few thoughts about leadership because the truth is, I believe leadership is both a gift and a skill. And each one of you are probably in this room because your peers around you -- your teachers, your friends, your families -- have all noticed that you have the gift of leadership, and they want to see you develop that.\nBut I often liken leadership to natural athletic ability, of which I have very little, to be honest. But natural athletic ability, what separates the person that is able to play as a professional athlete, and the person who just plays in a good pick-up game with a lot of talent, is perseverance and determination; meaning I really believe each one of us are born with a certain amount of gifts and abilities. But we're obligated then, we have a responsibility then to develop those gifts and abilities, and I think leadership is just that kind of a gift.\nBecause the truth is, I've spent the better part of my life trying to understand the nature of leadership. It's an ongoing study from me, and I learn more about it every day. I've worked hard to learn what I believe are the principles of good leadership and to put them into practice. And so I thought I might share a few words about leadership before I leave you this morning.\nFirst off, remember this, if you're taking notes: People follow people they respect. So first and foremost, if you aspire to be a leader, you must aspire to be men and women of character.\nSecondly, I believe that that character can best be defined for leaders in servant leadership, with the qualities of humility and respect for authority and self-control. And when it comes to public service in particular, I would encourage you to reflect deeply on the principles of servant leadership. I urge you to be servant leaders, driven by a calling to support and to serve others -- not by selfish ambition -- as the animating force of your career.\nYou know, the leader I most try and emulate each and every day said, nearly 2,000 years ago, that he came not to be served but to serve. And I believe that's the very essence of servant leadership. And there are three qualities in particular that I encourage you to reflect on.\nThe first is humility. It's often in too scarce a supply in our society today. I mean, the ability to consider others as more important than yourself. For a leader, there's nothing inconsistent about humility and authority. I mean, the truth of the matter is that some of the most compelling leaders I've ever known in my life are people that are focused on others more than themselves, are considerate to others. I truly believe that to reflect humility is to approach leadership every day as a learner and as a listener.\nYou know, true leaders listen first and then they decide. I remember I was at a meeting during the transition, and we brought in a group of virtually all of the high-tech entrepreneurs and executives in America to meet with our new President -- then President-elect Donald Trump. And for the better part of two hours, I witnessed as the President asked one question after another, and then he listened intently to how we could continue to grow jobs in the high-tech sector in America.\nAnd one of the most prominent members of that community came up to me afterwards and said to me how amazed they were at the way the President had spent two hours asking questions and listening to answers. And they asked me if he was like that all the time, and I said, every day. The truth is, our President, he leads by asking questions and he listens. And I believe that reflects the kind of humility that will enhance your ability to be a leader.\nThe second quality of leadership, I believe, in our society today that is most in need is orientation to authority. Recognize and respect those who have been placed above you. Honor them. Learn from them. Follow their example. Give them the honor that they are due. Never that they ask for it, but there's nothing more meaningful when you enter an organization in the years ahead, and you take a time to demonstrate respect for those who have been placed in authority over you; to listen to them and to defer to them, even while you offer them the broadest range of your counsel and your talents.\nAnd lastly, I encourage you -- as you develop these inner qualities, the qualities of being leaders that people respect and will follow, I encourage you to embrace self-control in your life. You know, as the Old Book says, like a city whose walls are broken down is the person who lacks self-control. I mean, whether it's in our physical lives, whether it's in our organization each and every day, to practice discipline and to practice self-control is to become the kind of woman and man that people will respect and people will follow.\nIf you want to make a difference in this complicated world, be different by leading an orderly life, by being an example of humility and orientation, and have a servant's heart with all of those around you. You know, I really do believe if you model these three qualities in increasing measure, your service will be of distinction no matter where your life may lead.\nAnd finally, one word of admonition. And that is, if you aspire to lead, you'll need a healthy dose of courage because leadership brings honor and opposition. As President Trump said just a few months ago, nothing worth doing ever came easy. Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage to do what is right, and no truer words are spoken.\nAnyone who dreams big will encounter those who think small, all right? Anyone who dares to step forward will find those who would rather stay put. And anyone who thinks they can will always hear from those who are sure they can't.\nSo I just say to you, cheerfully -- expect criticism. Listen to it. Have the humility to learn from it. And then push through it. That's the essence of leadership.\nYou know, you're here today, all of you, because you've already been recognized as emerging leaders in this rising generation. You're the future of America and the future of the countries from which many of you in this room come. And I just want you to know we're counting on you. We're counting on all of you in the days ahead.\nSo I'm here to say thank you -- to congratulate you -- but also to urge you to keep learning about leadership. Keep developing in the qualities of men and women who will have the respect and the character and the ability to lead wherever that leadership calls you. Keep persevering and lead fearlessly.\nAnd one last thing as you prepare to lead, I urge you to have faith. Have faith in your calling, in your abilities, and in the confidence that has been placed in you by those who love you and have mentored you.\nTo come to an event like this, I expect you had to be willing to step forward and tell people what you really wanted to do with your life. Sometimes when I'm out traveling around the country, I'll meet one of these well-dressed, well-appointed young men and women who will walk up to me and they'll nervously stick their hand out and introduce themselves. And I say, what do you want to do with your life? And they say, well -- they look down, shuffle their feet, and they say, well, I'd like to run for public office. And I always shake their hand and I say, well, you've just passed the first test.\nBecause you got to be willing to say it. You got to be willing to express your dreams and get ready for the people that are going to slap you on the shoulder and say, you know what, I think you'd be great at that, and also get ready for a few people that will roll their eyes and say, you couldn't possibly do that.\nSomebody that says, well, I want to be in the intelligence service, I want to serve around the world in the Foreign Service, I want to serve in a large agency in government, or I want to hold office in my hometown and home state or here in our Nation's Capital. Just be willing to say it, speak it out. And believe in yourself, have faith in yourself.\nI don't know where the dream of this calling of service started for you, but it really started for me back on 31st Street in Everroad Park West in Columbus, Indiana. We lived in a little tiny house. My brother and I literally slept in the same bed till he was about two years old. My late father used to say -- when we were growing up, he didn't have two nickels to rub together, but they somehow made it do. We had a cornfield in the back yard.\nBut I somehow got on that little street, in that little small town, a calling for public service. The heroes of my youth were President John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I actually started in politics in the other political party because those were the heroes of my youth. But then, as I grew older, I heard the voice of my second-favorite President, Ronald Reagan, and I joined the Republican Party.\nBut whatever your calling is, however early it began, don't let anybody gainsay it. Don't let anybody tell you that's a child's dream that you had. It's not. It's a calling, and you recognize it in your heart. And so I encourage you to have faith in that calling. Believe in it. Reach for it. Grab it. And understand the sky is the limit.\nI stand before you today deeply humbled to tell you that the dream of my life was to someday represent my hometown here in Washington, D.C. And it took me a couple times trying. I lost the two times I ran for Congress. And then 10 years later I was elected. And I served here in our Nation's Capital for 12 years. It was a great blessing. And that was the greatest aspiration of my life. I never imagined, to be honest with you, that I'd have a chance -- this grandson of an immigrant -- to be governor of the state that I grew up in, but I had the chance to serve as governor of the state of Indiana. And I don't know even know where to put the office I have the opportunity to hold today. It's just deeply humbling to me.\nPeople ask me sometimes, what's it like to be the 48th Vice President of the United States? And I just tell them, it's a privilege and I'm humbled. But I really do believe these words of admonition I've given each one of you this morning, if you make these qualities more real in your life, then you need to keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times. Pull the roll bar down, because you just got to hang on. Because wherever you're from, people will be drawn to your leadership, and you just hang on for where it's going to go.\nSo have faith in your abilities, have faith in the boundless nature of your dreams. And, lastly, if you're of a mind, have faith in Him who I believe put these gifts and callings within you, because I believe He'll open doors of opportunity and blessing in your life that you could never ask or imagine.\nFor again, lastly, as the Old Book says, we got a big Bible verse over the mantle in our home. It's been there since the first time I ran successfully for office back in 1999. It simply reads words out of the Book of Jeremiah. It says: \"For I know the plans I have for you -- plans to prosper you and not to harm you; plans to give you hope and a future.\"\nToday you may be students, tomorrow you will be leaders. And I know that with your help, with your hard work, with your character and with your efforts, and with God's help, this generation will take this country to heights unimaginable and a boundless American future.\nAnd as you prepare to begin your lives as leaders, be confident. As I look out across this gathering, inspired by the shining faces that are looking back at me, and I look at the leadership of President Trump and the leadership that we enjoy in this nation at every level, I'm confident -- and I say to this rising generation -- together, we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And as our President loves to say, we will Make America Great Again.\nThank you very much. God bless you. Congratulations. (Applause.)\nEND 10:19 A.M.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126656", "text": "The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has analyzed the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) estimate of the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), particularly the bill's effect on Medicaid since this effect has not been adequately analyzed. Although CBO's estimates should be discounted because of the large errors made by the agency in estimating the toll of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), CEA's analysis provides important information about the undescriptive CBO estimate regarding BCRA's effect on federal Medicaid spending.\nWhile the media has reported that the BCRA makes significant Medicaid \"cuts,\" the BCRA results in at least $265 billion more federal Medicaid spending between 2018 and 2026, relative to 2017 levels of spending. This spending could be as high as $554 billion if CBO is wrong that people will drop Medicaid coverage simply because of repealing the individual mandate. Moreover, a large part of the reported \"cuts,\" which are actually reductions in the rate of federal Medicaid spending growth, result from CBO's unlikely assumption that more than half of non-expansion states adopt the Medicaid expansion by 2026. Of crucial importance, the BCRA puts Medicaid on a sustainable trajectory. Specifically:\n* CEA found that in CBO's analysis of the BCRA, 60 percent of the reduction in future increases in Medicaid spending will result from repealing the individual mandate and ending the enhanced match rate for states that have not already adopted Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.\n* CEA estimated that repealing the individual mandate will result in Medicaid spending over the next decade to be $289 billion less than under current law as CBO believes that 4 million people, on net, in 2018 and 7 million people, on net, in 2026 will leave Medicaid. This estimate is likely substantially inflated since Medicaid enrollees currently pay little to no out of pocket costs and most are not subject to the individual mandate penalty.\n* CEA found that CBO's analysis assumes that more than half of non-Medicaid expansion states will choose to adopt expansion under current law, and therefore Medicaid spending will increase by $170 billion over the next decade. But given that state legislatures in several expansion states, such as Ohio and Arkansas, are trying to trim Medicaid expansion due to cost overruns and that states' share of the expansion bill increases over time, it is unlikely that many non-expansion states would adopt the expansion by 2026. In direct contrast to the CBO estimate, the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not predict additional states will expand under current law.\n* CEA found that the remainder of reduced federal Medicaid spending over the next decade from CBO's analysis totals $313 billion and is largely attributable to the phase-down of the enhanced match rate from 2021 to 2024 and structural Medicaid reforms. The phase-down of the enhanced match rate must occur for two important reasons. First, the Federal Government's discrimination against traditional populations, such as the disabled and low-income children, pregnant women, and seniors in favor of the expansion population of non-disabled, working-age adults must end. Second, expansion costs are substantially higher than expected as many expansion states have richly rewarded healthcare special interests with federal money through the enhanced match.\n* The structural Medicaid reforms—capped allotments combined with additional state flexibility—will help preserve the program for those who truly depend on it while protecting taxpayers against wasteful and inefficient spending.", "timestamp": "2017-07-12", "title": "White House Statement on CEA Analysis of BCRA Medicaid Provisions"}

Earlier this afternoon, the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded the confirmation hearing for Chris Wray, the President's nominee for FBI director.\nDuring his hearing, Chris Wray continually displayed the strong character, deep knowledge, and moral integrity that make him, as former Democrat Senator Sam Nunn testified, \"…the leader the [FBI] needs at this critical moment.\" And the President looks forward to seeing this incredibly qualified nominee move through the Judiciary Committee and be swiftly confirmed by the full Senate.\nAlso, on the Hill today, three bills that represent important tools in combatting human trafficking are on the floor of the House for a vote. H.R. 2200, which reauthorizes $130 million in funding for the prevention of human trafficking, protection of victims, and prosecution of traffickers. H.R. 2664, which ensures the Department of Labor effectively trains its employees to recognize and respond to the illegal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain. And, lastly, H.R. 2480, which expands the ability of a DOJ program to enable law enforcement agencies to compete for federal funding, specifically to develop and carry out programs that fight sex trafficking demand.\nPresident Trump has focused on ending human trafficking, and hopes that these bills will pass the House and move to the Senate quickly so we can continue to fight against this horrific practice.\nWhile the House takes up these critical bills on human trafficking today, the Senate is continuing its work on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. As I've said time and time again, with every day that goes by with this collapsing law still in place, more hardworking Americans see their healthcare options either disappear entirely or become too costly for their families to use.\nThe President was elected to protect those American families, and he looks forward to seeing the Senate continue to move toward a solution that works for all Americans during the upcoming weeks.\nAlso on the Hill, the President was glad to see David Nye confirmed as a U.S. District Judge in Idaho by a vote of 100-0. It's unfortunate, though, that this clearly eminently qualified nominee who was reported out of committee by a voice vote faced more than 30 procedural hurdles forced by Senate Democrats before his unanimous vote. Senate Democrats continue to show the American people that they'd rather play political games with these critical nominations than work with this administration. As the Majority Leader said, if they continue at this rate, it will take the Senate almost 11.5 years to confirm the remaining presidential appointments.\nWe're again calling on Senate Democrats to stop brazenly abusing Senate procedure to hold up the President's experienced and accomplished nominees so that he can continue his work on behalf of the American people.\nWe've received several inquiries on what the President -- on his agenda for the past couple of days, so I'd like to read some of that out before I take your questions. He's had multiple meetings with key economic advisors, particularly on issues of trade, such as Ambassador Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross, NEC Director Gary Cohn, and Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, Peter Navarro.\nHe's had multiple meetings on cybersecurity with homeland security advisors, and met separately with his national security team, and a number of meetings with members of his legislative affairs team and the Vice President specifically on healthcare. Lastly, he had a meeting with his Faith Advisory Board to discuss issues important to the faith community.\nAs you all know, later tonight the President will depart for Paris, France for meetings and celebrations with America's oldest ally.\nTomorrow, the President will have lunch with American military commanders, after which he will join French President Macron for a tour of the French Military Museum. After a bilateral meeting with the President, the two leaders will hold a press conference. And in the evening, President Trump and the First Lady will dine with the President and his wife.\nOn Friday, the President will attend France's annual Bastille Day celebration -- the first President to do so since 1989.\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States entry into World War I, the people of France have designated America this year's national guest of honor. Troops from the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, the first unit to arrive on French soil in 1917, will march in the parade, and U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds will conduct a flyover with planes with the French air force.\nAnd after the parade, the President will return back to the United States.\nOn the topic of previous inquiries -- because I like to do my best to get back to you -- yesterday I received a question from John Gizzi about whether we'd support changing Senate blue slip procedures for judicial nominees. And the White House is deferring to the Senate on this Senate procedure, and we have multiple highly qualified nominees waiting for Senate hearings, and hope the Senate can start moving them along quickly.\nFinally, and lastly, we understand the Chinese hospital treating Nobel Peace Prize laureate and writer, Liu Xiaobo, has invited U.S., German medical experts to China for medical consultations. We remain concerned that both Mr. Liu and his family are unable to communicate with the outside world and that he is not free to seek the medical treatment of his choosing.\nWe continue to call on the Chinese authorities to grant him full parole and to release his wife from house arrest and provide them the protections and freedoms, such as freedom of movement and access to appropriate medical care consistent with Chinese constitution, legal system, and international commitments.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. Phil.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. Has President Trump had any communication with his son, Donald Trump, Jr., over the last several days? And was he involved in helping Donald Trump, Jr. craft his statement to the press over the weekend on Air Force One, as was reported in the New York Times?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about specific communications and the nature of those conversations. I know that they've spoken at least at some point over the last few days, but beyond that I don't have any other further details.\nQ: Has he helped him with his response?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, but I just don't know the answer to that, Phil.\nQ: So is that not true?\nMS. SANDERS: I've been telling you, I'm just not sure. I don't know the answer. I'll have to check and let you know.\nQ: Okay. Can you find out?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thank you. You opened today by talking about the strong character and integrity of Christopher Wray. He said, during the hearing today, that he does not consider Mueller's probe to be a witch hunt, neither do Republican leaders in Congress, neither does Rob Rosenstein at the Justice Department. So why does the President continue to call it a witch hunt, especially now that there's hard evidence, released by his own son, that the campaign knew that Russia sought to interfere in the election?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has made extremely clear his position on that, and it certainly has not changed.\nQ: Can you reiterate then why he calls it a witch hunt?\nMS. SANDERS: Because the President knows very specifically any action or inaction that has taken. And so I think that's pretty clear.\nQ: Does that include members of his campaign?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think we've been extremely clear, and I know Don Jr. was and discussed it at length last night, as did the President's personal counsel over the last couple of days, and have walked through that very detailed.\nI think if there's been any evidence of collusion in 2016 that's come out at all or been discussed that's actually happened, it would be between the DNC and the Ukrainian government. I don't often quote the New York Times, but even one of their reporters tweeted earlier today that -- why this example provides evidence of collusion: \"Cooperation was between DNC officials and officials from the Ukrainian government, not just some associate.\"\nUkrainian actions to coordinate with the DNC was actually successful, unlike anything shown by Don Jr.'s emails. Information passed to the DNC from the Ukrainian government directly targeted members of the Trump campaign in an attempt to undermine it. And that was just Ukraine. The other big news was the foreign intelligence dossier that the President's political opponents funded and disseminated widely, and was based on discredited opposition research from foreign intelligence sources. The only collusion I've seen, and that's certainly been proven, would be between those people.\nMajor.\nQ: So does the President support the three changes that the Senate Republicans have made in the healthcare bill to retain all of the tax increases on upper-income investment earner and healthcare CEOs? And if so, why?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't talked to him about the specific breakdown of those three things. I think the President, from day one, has been very clear about his priorities when it comes to the healthcare legislation. That's what he's focused on, and beyond that I haven't gotten into the details with either he or Marc Short.\nQ: Would retaining those tax increases, which Republicans have criticized since their enactment, fulfill the President's pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act when they are foundational tax increases of that very law?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure on that specific piece, but I do know, again, the President is committed to fully repealing and replacing Obamacare.\nQ: Can you do that and keep those tax increases?\nMS. SANDERS: I'd have to look at the specific piece you're talking about, and I haven't done that, Major.\nQ: So let me just ask you one question on this issue of those within the administration who had to subsequently admit or concede contacts with Russians -- Mike Flynn, Jared Kushner, the Attorney General, and now Don Jr. Can you explain to us why there's this plague of amnesia that affects all these people associated with the campaign and one country, and one country only?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think if you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I'd look no further than the Clintons. Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin. Hillary Clinton allowed one-fifth of America's uranium reserve to be sold to a Russian firm --\nQ: What about this question?\nMS. SANDERS: -- whose investors were Clinton Foundation donors. The Clinton campaign chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia's largest bank and failed to report it. I think if we're looking at Russia relations with anybody, it would be directly with the Clintons.\nQ: But my question was specifically about the need and the requirement to re-remember things that were not disclosed or forgotten. And I'm just trying to get your explanation as to why so many people can't remember contacts with one nation, and the inquiries lead them to then remember and then subsequently disclose them. What accounts for this plague of amnesia?\nMS. SANDERS: Every single day we do our best to give the most accurate information that we have, and we continue to do that every single day, and have offered to be as transparent as possible with all committees and anyone looking into this matter.\nQ: This doesn't suggest to you a pattern of not trying to be transparent?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. Again, like I said, our goal is to be as transparent as humanly possible, and to put every bit of information that we have at the forefront, and willing to cooperate with anybody that is looking into the matter.\nQ: But, Sarah, when it's not at the forefront, when it has to be concealed and then security clearance forms, in the case of Jared Kushner, have to be amended and there's re-remembering forced on them either by investigators or by journalists, how is that being at the forefront of transparency?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, every time a question is asked, we give you the best information that we have, and try to give you as full and accurate information as possible at all times.\nQ: And have you done that in this case?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely.\nQ: So just -- I guess so we're all on the same page, and now you've had time to look into all these various meetings and people can remember things, are there any other additional meetings members of the campaigns have had, advisors to the campaign have had during the campaign between any Russian nationals and members of the campaign or advisors to the campaign? Anything else that's come to light that we should know about?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nDave.\nQ: Oh, can I just have one more follow-up?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure.\nQ: You've been doing a lot of briefings lately. Will you continue doing the briefings? Or can we expect Sean to be doing any briefings in the future?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we're all just trying to do the very best job we can every day, and sometimes it may be me, sometimes it may be Sean.\nDave.\nQ: On the meeting with the Faith Advisory Board, someone tweeted out a picture of the meeting the other day, and there was a -- the picture showed people, faith leaders laying their hands on the President as they were praying. And I think there was an inference or implication from that photo coverage that they were praying for him because of a political crisis. Could you explain a little bit more about how the meeting came about and what it meant to the President to have them there?\nMS. SANDERS: The idea that somebody would only pray when they're in crisis I think makes you miss the entire point of what prayer is about. You should do that every day, and that's -- I think you can do that in the best of times and the worst of times. So I think it would be ridiculous to suggest the only time you might do that is in a time of crisis.\nQ: How did the meeting come about? And what did it mean to the President?\nMS. SANDERS: It's his Faith Advisory Board, and they meet from time to time to speak about issues that are important to that community.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. Chris Wray was asked today in his confirmation hearing whether he believes Russia is a friend or a foe. And he said in his answer that he believes that Russia is a country that should be viewed, in his words, \"warily.\" I asked you this question on Monday, and I did not get an answer from you. I believe the same question was asked of you yesterday. You said you'd get back to us.\nAnd I think it's a pretty basic question as to whether or not the President views Russia as a friend, a partner, an ally, or an adversary. Do you have an answer yet on that question?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't. But, John, I do assure you I will certainly work to make sure I get that answer to you.\nQ: And another question as it relates to the Russia sanctions bill. You had Marc Short out here the other day talking about the need for a waiver on that bill. That's what the administration would like to see. If there is no waiver attached to the bill, and it comes before the President's desk, would the President veto this legislation?\nMS. SANDERS: Right now we haven't made a determination because we don't think that this is an all-or-nothing process, nor should it be. And in the current form, the legislation poses a number of risks to the U.S. government's ability to conduct foreign policy. Until they get further in the process, we're not going to weigh in any further.\nJeff.\nQ: Sarah, following up on the Chris Wray testimony today, he also said that he would not pledge loyalty to President Trump. Is that something that the President expects of him?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President expects anybody that works anywhere in government to pledge loyalty to the country, and I think that would be the only pledge of loyalty that anyone would be asked.\nQ: And one follow-up on just the general Russia question. Can you describe the President's mood? Is he frustrated by these stories? Is frustrated by Donald Jr.? How is he feeling?\nMS. SANDERS: The President wants to be focused on his agenda, and he'd much rather be talking about healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, national security. I think that's his focus, and when he's talking about those things, that's a good day for all Americans.\nPeter.\nQ: Sarah, I want to ask you, the drip, drip, drip is undermining the credibility of this administration. Do you perceive that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's actually undermining the credibility of the media because they drip, drip, drip a lot of things that don't seem to have much to -- much ado about nothing.\nQ: To be clear, that's not me, that's not the media saying that. This is Trey Gowdy, the Republican from the South Carolina, saying, this drip, drip, drip is undermining the credibility of this administration. So what do you say to Congressman Gowdy?\nMS. SANDERS: I think I just answered that.\nQ: So let me ask you if I can separately, you said -- being asked about the witch hunt a little bit earlier -- you said, the President feels comfortable saying as he's made clear that it's a witch hunt, because -- in your words -- he knows any action or inaction that has taken.\nBut given the fact that Jay Sekulow and you have conceded that the President -- or the outside counsel has conceded that the President was not aware of Donald Trump Jr. -- his own son's meeting with someone who was representing -- who was there under the guise of representing information from the Russian government, how can you say with certitude that the President does know any action that has taken place?\nMS. SANDERS: I think Jay Sekulow discussed this at length and covered that nothing inappropriate had taken place.\nQ: So does that -- but would you concede the President does not know? There may be actions that took place that the President does not know about?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, I think the President has been very clear about his opinion on the matter.\nJon.\nQ: So, Sarah, just two things. One on the issue of transparency, we now have three straight weekdays when there hasn't been any single, public event on the President's schedule. That's unusual for any President, especially this one who through the first months of his presidency was constantly bringing the pool in. We saw him doing a number of events a day. Why the sudden secrecy and hiding from the public that we're seeing now? Why has the President not been visible to the public for the better part of a week?\nMS. SANDERS: There's nothing secret about having meetings, which I read off to you earlier, with members of his staff and members of the administration.\nThe President had an incredibly robust schedule overseas in both Poland and Germany, and he's preparing to leave this afternoon where he'll be spending quite a bit of time with a lot of those of you who are traveling, and will be taking questions from you guys tomorrow.\nQ: And then, on the Don Jr. emails, you've heard from a number of Democrats who have raised serious questions about the fact that Jared Kushner was also part of that meeting, he was part of that email chain, knew what that meeting was about, knew what was promised. What do you say to Democrats who say that Jared Kushner's security clearance should be revoked?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, we don't discuss security clearances, but I think Democrats are trying to play political games. And I think it's ridiculous.\nQ: Is there any concern, though, that the top advisor to the President --\nMS. SANDERS: Did nothing wrong? No.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You just said he'd much rather be talking about tax reform and healthcare and infrastructure. What has stopped him this week from talking about any of those things?\nMS. SANDERS: Like I said, he's been talking about those internally --\nQ: To the American people.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, he does that through a number of ways. We've been up here. Every day that I have been up here this week, I've included -- a pretty heavy portion of the opening statement has to do with healthcare and a number of other issues that are part of the President's agenda.\nWe've put out multiple statements on several issues, and members of his Cabinet have been very active in public capacity this week. And just because it's not the President directly standing behind a podium making a speech doesn't mean he's not communicating to the American people or pushing his agenda forward.\nQ: Right. But Jeff asked you how he's feeling, and you said he was frustrated because he'd much rather be talking about these things. Now you're saying he has been talking about these things.\nMS. SANDERS: He asked me specifically about that issue and whether or not he was frustrated by that issue.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions. First, thank you very much --\nMS. SANDERS: Just two, not three today?\nQ: Not three. First, thank you very much for getting back to me on the blue slip question. My other question you may recall was, would the administration itself take into account the recommendations of the American Bar Association on judicial appointments or not?\nMS. SANDERS: I didn't get a chance to check on that part of the question, so I'll have to circle back.\nQ: My other question is: The President, today, had an interview with Reverend Robertson, and I wondered if this would lead to the opening of further interviews with some of us one-on-one with the President, or very possibly a news conference in the near future.\nMS. SANDERS: He's holding a press conference tomorrow while he's in Paris, and I'll certainly put in the request for an interview with you, John.\nMike.\nQ: Two healthcare questions. It looks like we may get some new version of the Senate bill tomorrow, perhaps, and some action maybe next week. As this heads towards what may be some kind of conclusion if it happens, how much credit does the White House think that it should take and that President Trump should get or receive for how that bill is shaped in the end?\nMS. SANDERS: Right now I think the White House is not focused on who gets the credit, but making sure that American people get the care. That's our focus and that hasn't changed.\nQ: Is the White House actually actively participating, then? Is the President participating, helping to shape some of the stuff that --\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, we've said this all along, that the White House and members of the administration have provided technical assistance throughout the process, and we're going to continue to do that.\nQ: On that, President Trump is known for loving to put his name on the top of his buildings and everything else that he can get his name on. President Obama didn't name Obamacare \"Obamacare.\" If --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sure he wishes he hadn't now. (Laughter.)\nQ: You'd have to ask him, I suppose. Does President Trump hope that whatever emerges from the process will ultimately be known as Trumpcare?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, I've said it many times before: We're not focused on the label but focused on making sure we have a healthcare system in place that actually works, doesn't bankrupt the system, and help protect Americans across the board.\nKevin.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you. When the President has his conversations with President Macron, is it your expectation that he will ask him, or at least engage him, on this concept of climate change and the Paris Accord, or maybe what might come out of our lack of participation in that accord? And I guess my follow-up would be about Janet Yellen. We've asked you before if the President has confidence in her. If she were not in that position, would Gary Cohn be someone the President would like to see in a position like that?\nMS. SANDERS: On the first question, you know, we never get ahead of the President's conversations. We'll certainly provide a readout and you guys will also have the chance to ask the President himself and hear a joint statement from both Presidents after their meeting.\nIn terms of Janet Yellen and Gary Cohn, I think Gary has been pretty clear that he loves his job and he's happy doing what he's doing, and I don't have anything further to add on that.\nQ: Did the President watch, by the way, Mr. Wray today, by chance? I know he said in his tweet, I don't even have time to watch TV. You think he had a chance to pick up some of that coverage?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if he saw much of it, if any. I know that he was doing quite a few meetings earlier this morning. So as far as I'm aware, I don't know if he saw any of it.\nQ: Sarah, I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman of California. Today he entered an official bill, an article of impeachment. Any response?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that is utterly and completely ridiculous and a political game at its worst.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 3:47 P.M.

Walden, R-OR, and three cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to expanding access to safe and affordable drugs and medical devices through timely reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments, the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, and the Biosimilar User Fee Act.\nH.R. 2430 would reauthorize these four Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fee programs, under which companies that develop drugs and medical devices partially pay for FDA's premarket review of their products. H.R. 2430 also includes a number of provisions to improve FDA's drug review process, including greater use of real-world evidence and enhancing drug development tools such as biomarker development. FDA's review activities are critical to promoting rapid access to innovative therapies and driving competition toward better healthcare results and lower prices for American consumers. Improvements in FDA's premarket review process, funded by these user fee programs, have encouraged drug and device makers to expand research and development, leading to advances in medical technology that have saved and improved countless lives.\nThe President's Budget promotes faster economic growth by lowering taxes and strategically devoting resources to urgent priorities. To better support FDA's lifesaving mission while carefully spending taxpayer dollars, the President's Budget asks companies that benefit directly from FDA's premarket review of medical products to finance 100 percent of FDA's premarket review. In its current form, H.R. 2430 would require significant investment of taxpayer resources in FDA's medical product review programs. The Administration urges the Congress to provide for 100 percent user fee funding within the reauthorized programs. In an era of renewed fiscal restraint, industries that benefit directly from FDA's work should pay for it.\nThe Administration is also concerned with certain other provisions in the bill, such as those providing additional market exclusivity to manufacturers, which could make exclusivity unpredictable and decrease competition. The Administration is committed to promoting the availability of generics in an efficient and effective manner that avoids unintended, adverse consequences. In addition, there are a number of important technical changes that the Administration seeks to make to the bill, including adjusting the foreign drug facility inspection fee.\nThe Administration supports the goals of H.R. 2430 and looks forward to working with the Congress to expand access to affordable, lifesaving drugs and medical devices in a thoughtful manner that protects taxpayer resources, promotes competition, improves healthcare outcomes, and stimulates scientific innovation and medical advances.", "timestamp": "2017-07-12", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 2430 - FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017"}

This agreement falls under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2013 by Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. The MOU establishes the Red-Dead Sea Conveyance Project, which involves construction of a desalination plant in Aqaba that will provide fresh water to Jordan and Israel and convey brine to the Dead Sea to reduce its rate of decline.? The Project also involves Israel supplying additional water to Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.\nUnder the leadership of President Donald J. Trump, Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt successfully supported the Israeli and Palestinian efforts to bridge the gaps and reach an agreement on this vital issue. President Trump has made it clear that working towards achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians is a top priority for him, and he strongly believes that peace is possible. The Administration has urged the parties to undertake efforts to promote an environment that is conducive to advancing peace, and this new agreement, the second major Israeli-Palestinian agreement signed this week, is another indication that the parties are capable of working together to achieve mutually beneficial results.", "timestamp": "2017-07-13", "title": "Press Release - Donald J.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126648", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, first and foremost on behalf of President Trump and the First Family, welcome to the White House. We are delighted to have you here.\nI want to thank you for what all of the members of the Philanthropy Roundtable mean to the life of this nation. For 30 years, the Philanthropy Roundtable has mustered the power of private charity to advance liberty, opportunity, and personal responsibility. And the contributions of the foundations represented around this table are immense and have changed lives across this country in incalculable ways. So thank you so much for all the institutions that you represent have done.\nToday you have a membership of some 630 organizations and individuals. The causes you support make a difference in communities large and small. The President and I are particularly grateful for your support for school choice and advancing those principles, as my friend Fred Klipsch has done from Indiana, Hoosiers for Quality Education, for many years. It's emblematic of the leadership that we have all around this table.\nYou represent the best of the American tradition of generosity, and I'm grateful to have a chance to talk to you about policies that we're advancing under President Trump's leadership here in our Nation's Capital from tax reform to healthcare reform. And I look forward very much to your input.\nIt's important to say that America is far and away the most generous nation on Earth and in the history of the world. Our people have given a record $373 billion to charitable causes last year alone. More than two-thirds of American households give to charity each and every year. So I say thank you. Thank you on behalf of your President. Thank you on behalf of the American people for the generosity represented around this table.\nNow each of us knows that charitable giving is fueled by generosity and by economic growth, and this administration is all about growth. I can assure you of that.\nFrom the first days of this administration, President Trump, our entire team has been working with the Congress to roll back excessive regulations, expand access to American energy, and the results speak for themselves -- 800,000 new jobs created since January of this year. And so important to these foundations that are gathered around here managing the portfolios that many of you manage, there's been almost a $3 trillion increase in stock market value since the outset of this administration.\nThe American people are more confident in many quarters than ever before, and you see that reflected in the stock market and investments that Americans are making.\nA more prosperous America can be a more generous America, and so I want to assure you that the President and I and our entire administration are anxious to get your counsel on how we might continue to promote economic growth.\nBut with that said, let me say that in addition to tax reform that we want to talk about today, President Trump and I truly believe that one of the keys to spurring economic growth in America today is to keep our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nAnd the President and I are very pleased that just a few hours ago, the leadership in the United States Senate released an updated version of the Senate healthcare bill. The President and I are truly grateful to Leader Mitch McConnell, and we urge every member of the United States Senate to roll their sleeves up and get this bill to the President's desk and get it there soon.\nAs I saw again in Kentucky just yesterday, American families and American businesses are hurting under the collapsing weight of Obamacare, and it's time for Congress to act. This legislation President Trump and I believe is the right bill at the right time to begin the end of Obamacare. And we would be grateful to have your support.\nThis legislation will put American healthcare back on a path toward more freedom, more choices, and more affordability for working families. The Senate healthcare bill repeals Obamacare individual and business mandates. It cuts taxes on working families and small businesses and restores freedom, and we believe it will create jobs.\nThe bill expands health savings accounts to pay for insurance premiums. It also offers tax credits to Americans to help buy coverage at a more affordable price. It provides $45 billion to states across the country to combat the scourge of opioid addiction and also ensures that every American with a preexisting condition has access to the coverage and care that they need -- no exceptions.\nAnd lastly, surrounded by so many great advocates of American personal responsibility and federalism, I can tell you that this legislation gives states all new freedom and flexibility to reform Medicaid in ways that it will better meet the needs of the most vulnerable in those states.\nWe truly do believe that the Senate healthcare bill is the beginning of the end of Obamacare. It will return American healthcare to a system based on our time-honored principles of free-market completion, personal responsibility, and state-based reform. And above all else, it will give the American people more freedom when it comes to the choices that they make for healthcare.\nPresident Trump and I look forward to the Senate voting on this bill as early as next week. We believe that together with Republicans in the Senate and soon considering this bill again in the House, that we will begin the end of Obamacare. And we will finally give the American people the kind of world-class healthcare they deserve built on the American principles of freedom, free-market choices, and state-based reform. And we'd be grateful to have your support.\nWith that, let me express my appreciation to all of you who are gathered here, but most especially to the leadership of the Philanthropy Roundtable. And, Adam Meyerson, if you'd like to make a few remarks.\nMR. MEYERSON: Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership as a champion for charities and for economic growth. And thank you, Marc Short, for taking the time to be with us today.\nAmerica, as you said, Mr. Vice President, is the most charitable country on Earth. No other country comes close. Volunteering private giving is central to our character as a people and it is central to our freedom. Independent private giving sustains the independence of private institutions; our churches and synagogues; our universities and colleges -- like Hanover -- our think tanks of left, right, and center; our health clinics for veterans; our crisis pregnancy centers; and the charitable deduction is an indispensable guardrail against the intrusion of government into our lives and into our communities.\nThe deduction tells political leaders that money given to charity is not theirs, but belongs to civil society. We're in a great national debate now about whether the federal government is exercising too much control of our lives, and our country faces great crises such as the collapse of the family, the failure of schools to teach our children. And these are crises where the answers are not to be found in Washington, but from churches, neighborhood problem solvers, and other institutions of civil society.\nNow is the time for more charitable giving, not less. Now is the time to increase charitable giving from 2 percent to 3 percent of GDP. And now is the time to make the charitable deduction universal, so it is available to all Americans.\nWe're so honored to be here and grateful for your leadership, and I'll look forward to the exchange of ideas.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Adam. Thank you all very much.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, will you be making calls this weekend to senators about the bill?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I was on Capitol Hill today.\nQ: How was the meeting?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Very encouraged by the action that Senate leadership has taken. We believe the Senate healthcare bill is the right bill at the right time. It's important that the Senate move forward next week -- bring this bill forward, send it back to the House, and put it on the President's desk.\nQ: Do you think the Leader will be able to get to 50 votes?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to work very hard. The President and I have already talked today, and President Trump and I and our entire administration strongly support the Senate healthcare bill. We believe it represents the beginning of the end of Obamacare. And the introduction of reforms in this legislation we believe will once again put the American people back in charge of their own healthcare and give states all new freedom and flexibility to ensure that Medicaid works in each individual state, particularly when it comes to the most vulnerable.", "timestamp": "2017-07-13", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at a Listening Session on Philanthropy"}

In his remarks, the President referred to Brigitte Macron, wife of President Macron; Federal Bureau of Investigation Director-designate Christopher A. Wray; Russian lawyer Natalia Vladimorovna Veselnitskaya; White House Senior Adviser Jared C. Kushner; Paul J. Manafort, Jr., former campaign chairman, Donald J.

A reporter referred to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126659", "text": "[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Macron. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First and foremost, I meant to thank President Trump for his visit to Paris this afternoon and tomorrow—tomorrow morning—as well as thank his delegation. I was very pleased that—to be able to welcome President Trump and his spouse today. He accepted the invitation I extended a couple of weeks ago in order to invite him to join the ceremonies of the 14th of July tomorrow.\nI think it is both a symbol and an important—very important that the President of the United States could be with us tomorrow on the occasion of our National Day and attend a military parade which will—to which the American troops will take part. We will be also commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the American troops joining World War I with the Allies in France.\nI think it is important because, beyond daily news, we live in countries with roots which are deeper and go further and beyond who we are. So the presence of President Trump was, in my eyes, not only natural, and I think it is also an excellent thing for the history of both our countries.\nEarlier today we started by sharing part of our joint history at the Invalides Museum, the Army Museum. Then, we had a working session. And I shall say that I'm extremely pleased about it. We've been able to talk about a number of topics of joint interest, and we underlined a number of shared convictions and, most importantly, a joint roadmap for—in order to work together in the coming months.\nWe agreed to do our utmost to have—to implement free and fair trade, and in the field—and this is what G-20 in Hamburg also expressed in terms of sensitivity—we want to work together in order to implement some efficient measures to tackle dumping anywhere it is taking place in all the fields, by sharing the information that we have and making sure that both the European Unions and the United States can take the necessary measures in order to protect within the context of free trade, but of fair, free trade that we can protect all over sectors of activities where we are active.\nWe then had a long discussion which enabled us to cover all of the topics of international policies and the challenges for the security—security challenges for the people as well. When it comes to fighting terrorism, from day one, I can say that we've seen eye to eye, and we are strongly determined to take any necessary measures in order to root out terrorism and to eradicate it no matter where, in particular their narrative. On the internet, we agreed to strengthen our action and our cooperation in fighting against propaganda.\nWe want to get the—all the major operators to limit the propaganda and also tackle cyber criminality. These topics, I believe, are fundamental. And I do hope that we can strengthen the cooperation between both our countries. And it is a lot—with a lot of satisfaction that I heard from President Trump the very same approach. And our services will then, therefore, be working together in the coming weeks and months to have a solid action map for that. Regarding the situation in Iraq and in Syria, here again, we agreed to continue to work together, in particular, in order to be able to launch together some diplomatic initiatives in order to put in place a roadmap for what will come after the war.\nWe talked about our role, our postconflict role, but initially, we want to put in place a contact group in order to be more efficient, in order to be able to support what is being done by the U.S.—by the United Nations, in order to support a political roadmap, in particular for Syria after the war. It is important to put in place some inclusive political solutions for that period of time. We know where destabilization comes from. The roadmap will take care of that. We'll cover it. And we'll also ask our diplomats and our staff to work along those lines so that, in the coming weeks, some concrete initiatives can be taken. And they're supported by the P-5.\nWe also share the same intentions regarding Libya. And like I told President Trump, I very much want to take a number of diplomatic initiatives, strong ones, given the situation that we know, and which requires more stability and better control over the region.\nWith Libya or the Sahel, I think I can say that we have the same vision, a very coherent understanding of the situation in the region, and the same willingness to act very clearly against any form of terrorism and destabilization.\nNext, climate. Well, here we know what our disagreements are. We have expressed them on a number of occasions. But I think it is important that we can continue to talk about it. I very much respect the decision taken by President Trump. He will work upon implementing his campaign promises. And as far as I'm concerned, I remain attached to the Paris accord, and we'll make sure that, step by step, we can do everything which is in the accord.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is in summary what we've been talking about. We will continue under a friendly—with a friendly tone and informal one this evening. Regarding trade and security for both our countries, the fight against terrorism, stability in the Near and Middle East, in Libya or in the Sahel, I can say that we have a shared determination. The United States is extremely involved in the Iraq war, and I would like to thank President Trump for everything that's been done by the American troops against this background. But I would like him to know that I am fully determined to act together with him in this respect, fully determined.\nI very much want both our countries in these matters to increase their cooperation in the coming months, because the threat we are facing is a global one. The enemies—our enemies—are trying to destabilize us by any way. And I believe that this is very much at the heart of the historic alliance between our two countries, and which fully justifies the presence of President Trump today and tomorrow in Paris.\nThank you. Thank you, dear Donald. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Well, thank you very much, President Macron. And Melania and I are thrilled to join you and Mrs. Macron. This is a wonderful national celebration, and we look very much forward to it. It will be spectacular tomorrow: Bastille Day.\nWe're honored to be here in your beautiful country—and it certainly is a beautiful country—with its proud history and its magnificent people. And thank you for the tour of some of the most incredible buildings anywhere in the world. I was very, very—a very beautiful thing to see. Thank you.\nWhen the French people rose up and stormed the Bastille, it changed the course of human history. Our two nations are forever joined together by the spirit of revolution and the fight for freedom. France is America's first and oldest ally. A lot of people don't know that. Ever since General Lafayette joined the American fight for independence, our fates and fortunes have been tied unequivocally together. It was a long time ago, but we are together, and I think together, perhaps, more so than ever. The relationship is very good.\nThis visit also commemorates another milestone. One century ago, the United States entered World War I. And when the President called me, he had mentioned that fact—a hundred years ago—that was—I said, Mr. President, I will be there. That's a big, important date. One hundred years.\nWe remember the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives in that valiant and very difficult struggle. We also pay tribute to the heroic deeds of the French troops whose courage at the Battle of Marne and countless other battles will never be forgotten by us. More than 1 million French soldiers laid down their lives in defense of liberty. Their sacrifice is an eternal tribute to France and to freedom. French and American patriots have fought together, bled together, and died together in the fight for our countries and our civilizations.\nToday, we face new threats from rogue regimes like North Korea, Iran, and Syria and the governments that finance and support them. We also face grave threats from terrorist organizations that wage war on innocent lives. Tomorrow will mark 1 year since a joyous Bastille Day celebration in Nice turned into a massacre. We all remember that, how horrible that was. We mourn the 86 lives that were stolen, and we pray for their loved ones. We also renew our resolve to stand united against these enemies of humanity and to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and ideological support.\nToday President Macron and myself discussed how we can strengthen our vital security partnerships. We just had a meeting with our generals and our representatives, and it went very well. France has excellent counterterrorism capabilities. The French troops are serving bravely in places like Mali to defeat these forces of murder and destruction. The United States and our allies strengthen our commitments to defeat terrorism.\nWe're also making tremendous progress. Earlier this week, with the strong support of the United States and the Global Coalition, Iraq forces liberated the city of Mosul from ISIS control. Now we must work with the Government of Iraq and our partners and allies in the region to consolidate the gains and ensure that the victory stays a victory, unlike the last time.\nLast week, the G-20 leaders also reaffirmed the right to sovereign nations to control their borders. We must be strong from within to defend ourselves from threats from the outside. The nations of the West also face domestic challenges of our own creation, including vast government bureaucracy that saps the strength from our economies and from our societies.\nFor this reason, I applaud President Macron on his courageous call for that \"less bureaucracy.\" It's a good chant: \"Less bureaucracy.\" We can use it too. [Laughter] And a Europe that protects its citizens. We did not become great through regulation—and in the United States, Mr. President, we also have cut regulations at a level that we've never seen before, so we're very proud of that, over the last 6 months—but by allowing our people to follow their dreams. That's what it's all about. To achieve these dreams, however, we must also confront unfair trade practices that hurt our workers and pursue trade deals that are reciprocal and fair.\nBoth President Macron and I understand our responsibility to prioritize the interests of our countries and, at the same time, to be respectful of the world in which we live. We live in a very complex world. We have to respect it. The United States remains committed to being a leader in environmental protection while we advance energy security and economic growth. The friendship between our two nations—and ourselves, I might add—is unbreakable. Our occasional disagreements are nothing compared to the immortal bonds of culture, destiny, and liberty that unite us. So strongly unite us also. As long as we have pride in who we are, where we've come from, how we got here, and what we've achieved as free and democratic nations, then there is nothing we cannot accomplish together.\nFrance helped us secure our independence. A lot of people forget. In the American Revolution, thousands of French soldiers fought alongside American troops so that, as Lafayette said, liberty would have a country. Ever since then, courageous heroes from both nations have fought for the same noble values and the same righteous cause.\nTomorrow the French Tricolor will once again wave proudly alongside the American Stars and Stripes. Our brave soldiers will march side by side, and we will all be inspired to protect and cherish the birthright of freedom that our ancestors won for us with their sweat and with their blood.\nPresident Macron, thank you for inviting Melania and myself to this historic celebration. And to you and your spectacular country: May God bless France, and may God bless America.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Macron. Thank you. Very well. I think we will be taking four questions.\nNeither President Trump nor myself have a microphone. [Laughter]\nPresident Trump. [Inaudible]\nQ. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.\nPresident Trump. He's getting first question, President?\nParis Agreement on Climate Change\n[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nQ. A question from LCI, sir. A question for President Macron regarding what you said on the occasion of the press conference together with Chancellor Merkel. Do you still hope that President Trump or did you still hope that President Trump could change his mind regarding the Paris accord? And now, President Trump, is it possible for you to come back to the Paris accord and change your mind?\nNext, regarding your relations, how would you describe it today? What about the dinner tonight? Is it going to be a dinner between friends?\nPresident Macron. Well, regarding climate, well, we have a number of disagreements, which are in particular due to the commitments taken by President Trump vis-à-vis his—during the Presidential campaign—so did I. I'm aware of how important that that is, but we, therefore, talked about our disagreement. And we actually discussed the matter even before President Trump reached the decision.\nNext, should that have an impact on the discussions we are having on all other topics? No, absolutely not. This is the reason why we share the same views and some major common goals on many other topics, on all other topics, which we've been discussing today and we shall move forward together. Next, well of course, President Trump will tell you about it, but he's made a number of commitments, and we're going to be working together, and my willingness to continue to work with the United States and the President on these very major topics. I understand that it's important to save jobs. That being said, we shall leave the United States of America work on what is its roadmap and continue to talk about it.\nSo today there is nothing new, unprecedented; otherwise, we would have told you about it. But I believe there is a joint willingness to continue to talk about this and try and find the best possible agreement. As far as I'm concerned, I am very much remain extremely attached to the framework of the Paris accord, which has been a major international breakthrough, and it is within that framework that I'm working on our priorities, including for the European Unions.\nLastly, as you know, I never very much want to comment who we are and what we are doing personally. But I can tell you that this evening, at the Eiffel Tower, it will be a dinner between friends, because we are the representatives of two countries which have been allies forever and because we've been able to build a strong relation which is dear to me, because it matters a great deal for both our countries. It will, therefore, give me great pleasure to have dinner together with you tonight.\nPresident Trump. I think that I can reiterate. We have a very good relationship, a good friendship. And we look forward to dinner tonight at the Eiffel Tower. That will be something special. And yes, I mean, something could happen with respect to the Paris accord. We'll see what happens. But we will talk about that over the coming period of time. And if it happens, that will be wonderful. And if it doesn't, that will be okay too. But we'll see what happens.\nBut we did discuss many things today, including the cease-fire in Syria. And we discussed the Ukraine. We discussed a lot of different topics. We briefly hit on the Paris accord. And we'll see what happens, okay?\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation/Donald J. Trump, Jr./2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you. Merci, Mr. President. Mr. President, your FBI nominee said if someone in a campaign got an email about Russia, like the one that your son Don Jr., received, that they should alert the FBI rather than accept that meeting. Is he wrong? Also, were you misled by your team in not knowing about this meeting?\nAnd, Mr. President, thank you very much. You have heard President Trump say that it may have been Russia, it may have been others, who interfered with the U.S. election. Is President Trump taking a hard enough line on Russia, as you see it? Merci.\nPresident Trump. Well, I'll start off by saying, first of all, I believe that we will have a great FBI Director. I think he's doing really well, and we're very proud of that choice. I think I've done a great service to the country by choosing him. He will make us all proud, and I think someday we'll see that, and, hopefully, someday soon. So we're very proud of him.\nAs far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast. Two of the people in the room, they—I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused on the meeting. I do think this: I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research or even research into your opponent. I've had many people—I have only been in politics for 2 years—but I've had many people call up, \"Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person, or frankly, Hillary.\" That's very standard in politics. Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information.\nIn the case of Don, he listened. I guess they talked about, as I see it, they talked about adoption and some things. Adoption wasn't even a part of the campaign. But nothing happened from the meeting. Zero happened from the meeting. And honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do.\nNow, the lawyer that went to the meeting, I see that she was in the Halls of Congress also. Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. Now, maybe that's wrong. I just heard that a little while ago. But I was a little surprised to hear that. So she was here because of Lynch.\nSo, again, I have a son who's a great young man. He's a fine person. He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. It lasted for a very short period, and nothing came of the meeting. And I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.\nMr. President.\n[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Macron. Yes, to answer your question, I will not interfere in U.S. domestic policy. And I think it's always good between partners and allies not to interfere in others' domestic life.\nPresident Trump. What a good answer that was. [Laughter]\n[President Macron continued in English as follows.]\nPresident Macron. And I do believe that both of us have a direct relationship with Russia. President Trump had a 2 hours—more than 2 hours' meeting with President Putin during this past G-20. So that's—and I myself had two very long meetings with President Putin: the very first one in Versailles and the second one during the G-20. And this relationship is very important. We have a lot of disagreements. We have a lot of discrepancies, obviously, with Russia. But in the current environment, especially in Middle East, it's a necessity to work together, to exchange information, to share disagreements, and to try to build solutions.\nSo that's my relationship with Russia. And we don't have, obviously, the same relationship as the one with the U.S. But that's a longstanding relationship with Russia as well, and I think it's important that both of us have direct discussion and contact with the President Putin.\nPresident Trump. One of the great things that came out of that meeting, by the way—even though it's not part of the question—was the fact that we got a cease-fire that now has lasted for, I guess, Mr. President, almost 5 days. And while 5 days doesn't sound like a long period of time, in terms of a cease-fire in Syria, that's a very long period of time. And that was a result of having communication with a country. So during that 5-year—5-day period, a lot of lives have been saved. A lot of people were not killed. No shots have been fired in a very, very dangerous part of the world, and this is one of the most dangerous parts of Syria itself.\nSo by having some communication and dialogue, we were able to have this cease-fire, and it's going to go on for a while. And frankly, we're working on a second cease-fire in a very rough part of Syria. And if we get that and a few more, all of a sudden, you're going to have no bullets being fired in Syria. And that would be a wonderful thing.\nMr. President, you have a question.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Macron. Third question.\nPresident Trump's View of President Macron\n[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nQ. From BFMTV, a question to President Macron. You went to Lausanne in order to support Paris's bid for the Olympic Games, and on this occasion, you somehow criticized President Trump's policy without naming him. You said that France made a very clear choice to leave his—its border open and not to build walls to protect its people. Do you condemn the Muslim ban and the building of the wall between the United States and Mexico?\nRegarding Syria, as it was just mentioned by President Trump, is France yet ready to talk directly with Bashar al-Asad in the negotiation that you mentioned?\n[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]\nYou've mentioned a friend, Jim, who told you that Paris is no longer Paris. You were implying at the time that Paris was not safe anymore. You've also said that France and Germany are infected by terrorism, and, quote, \"it's their fault because they let people enter their territory.\" Those are very strong words. Would you repeat them today? And do you still believe that France is not able to fight terrorism on its own territory? Thank you.\nPresident Trump. You'd better let me answer that one first. That's a beauty. [Laughter] He's the one that asked the question. That wasn't even one of my picks.\nYou know what, it's going to be just fine, because you have a great President. You have somebody that's going to run this country right. And I would be willing to bet because I think this is one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and you have a great leader now. You have a great President; you have a tough President. He's not going to be easy on people that are breaking the laws and people that show this tremendous violence.\nSo I really have a feeling that you're going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris, and I'm coming back. [Laughter] You'd better do a good job, please. [Laughter] Otherwise, you're going to make me look very bad.\n[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Macron. And you're always welcome.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Macron. Regarding the first question, like I said, I believe that the discussions that we've had today is the proper answer to terrorism. The right answer—strengthen cooperation between our services and never-ending fight against terrorists no matter where they are—this is what I was referring to; this is what we're working on actively together. So, in this respect, there is no difference and no gap between the French and the American positions. When I have something to say, I say it clearly, and I do say who I'm aiming at. And when I refer to those who have been my opponents in the French political battle, I also mention the names. So let us not mix up everything.\nAnd regarding the fight against terrorism, I think the right approach is to have a strengthened cooperation in the field of intelligence—is also to be working together on all the theaters of operation where we are. And I think that the decisions we've reached today, they will enable us to do more.\nNext, your question regarding Bashar al-Asad, which is an important one. Let me put it simply: Indeed, we now have a new approach of Syria because we want some results and we want to be closely working together with our partners, including the United States of America. We have one main goal, which is to eradicate terrorism. No matter who they are, we want to build an inclusive and sustainable political solution. Against that background, I do not require Asad's departure. This is no longer a prerequisite for France to work on that, because I can only tell you that for 7 years we did not have an Embassy in Damascus, and still we have no solution.\nNext, we also have a common redline together with President Trump. He intervened before I was elected, and I said it to President Putin after my election: No use whatsoever of chemical weapons. Any use will lead to reaction—an attack against a reaction regarding the storage places.\nAnd next, we also want humanitarian corridors. Also, we want to build a sustainable political stability for Syria. This is our roadmap. In order to stick to it, we need diplomatic initiative beyond our military actions. This is what we've been agreed upon—agreeing upon, because we want to take an initiative with the members of the Security Council and a number of countries involved in the process, in the matter. Of course, there will be representatives of Asad that will enable us to put in place the roadmap for after the war, but there will also be representatives of the Syrian opposition and people with different backgrounds, and we will talk to all of them against that background.\nOne last question for an American journalist.\nPresident Xi Jinping of China/North Korea\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nQ. Phoenix TV of China.\n[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nFor both Presidents: Mr. Macron, you had your first meeting with the Chinese President during the G-20 summit. What will France do? How will France cooperate with all of these areas with China? And what do you think personally of Mr. Xi Jinping?\n[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]\nYou have just met Chinese President, during the G-20 summit. And what—how do you want continue to work with China? And what do you personally think about Mr. Xi Jinping? Thank you very much. President Trump. Well, he's a friend of mine. I have great respect for him. We've gotten to know each other very well. A great leader. He's a very talented man. I think he's a very good man. He loves China, I can tell you. He loves China. He wants to do what's right for China.\nWe've asked him for some assistance with respect to North Korea. Probably, he could do a little bit more, but we'll find out. We're now working on some trade deals. He's been very nice. He's let, as you know, beef go back in, certain financing go back in, credit card financing, and various other things go back in at my request, which is a great thing for our farmers. So a lot of good things are happening, but we're going to be working on some very major trade components.\nBut President Xi is a terrific guy. I like being with him a lot, and he's a very special person.\nOkay? Thank you.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPresident Macron. I first talked to President Xi over the telephone; then, I got to meet him in the margin of the G-20 summit in Hamburg. Earlier—early next year, I will be traveling to China. We've agreed to it. So I cannot say that he's a friend of mine or that I know him very well, because I very much want to say things as they are. But we had some initial contacts which were extremely fruitful and positive.\nI have a lot of respect for President Xi, and I would like to say that over the past few months he did express his willingness to have a vision for multilateralism and wanted to commit himself on a number of topics. I think that many of us remember his words in Davos, and he there very strongly expressed his vision of the role of China. We have a number of joint commitments, including on climate. He's very committed to that, and he told me that he wanted to do more in the field, and I can only be happy about it. He wants strong cooperation.\nAnd like President Trump said, the—also the trade issues and regarding the number of activities—there are issues, there are differences, but a joint willingness to sort out—sort them out. And as permanent members of the Security Council, we want to work together on all of the topics we've been discussing today.\nAnd China, in this respect, is a key partner in order to build peace all around the world, and I share what President Trump just said, that China is to play a very specific role regarding the rising tension, the growing tension in—with North Korea. And it's important that China can play fully its role in the region.\nIn summary, I think he is today one of the great leaders of our world, implementing a major and ambitious reform of China society and the economy in China. And therefore, my willingness, in this respect as well, is to have a strategic dialogue, the purpose of which is to continue to talk about the industry of—civil nuclear industry, economic matters, and talk about any difficulties we may have together.\nVery well. Allow me to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and once again thank President Trump for his visit. And I will be seeing him in a few moments in a friendly atmosphere.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.\nPresident Macron. Thank you, my friend.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. President Macron. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-07-13", "title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, France"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126670", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Newark, New Jersey\n3:01 P.M. CET\nMR. BOSSERT: So let me just start the conversation by saying that President Trump and President Macron had private conversations yesterday, but also an extended bilateral conversation. And I wanted to talk you about that and give you a readout, and answer your questions if I might.\nQ: Did they discuss the role that Syrian Kurds might have in a future Syria after ISIS?\nMR. BOSSERT: So, among other things in the bilateral conversation yesterday, the Presidents discussed Syria -- defeating ISIS in general, but Syria specifically; our desire to have a political solution outside and after our military solutions prevail. They discussed counterterrorism in general, as it will be an enduring and ongoing problem after our defeat-ISIS campaign takes the physical caliphate from ISIS.\nThey discussed limiting and containing and, ultimately, reducing and removing Iranian sponsorship for terrorism and regional influence. They discussed the current relations with Qatar. They discussed what to do after our short-term objectives are met in reducing their contributions -- financial contributions -- to terrorism, and three or four other topics.\nIn general, the conversation was detailed, the conversation was fairly involved, and we discussed terrorism, largely. President Trump thanked President Macron for France's continued and pretty extensive support for not only American efforts, but for global efforts to counter terrorism in North Africa and throughout the Sahel region. That's something that the French have been committed to and have doubled and redoubled their efforts, I think, in the last three to five years. And President Macron has shown leadership there in that regard.\nQ: The former Obama administration officials on the NSC said that the U.S.-French relations were really good in terms of counterterrorism, but intelligence-sharing was one of the kinks in the relationship. Can you tell me how that might be improved with this new alliance -- with friendship with President Macron and President Trump?\nMR. BOSSERT: There are no kinks in that relationship. In fact, the intelligence-sharing and counterterrorism-sharing between the two countries has never been better. And I can tell you that from the perspective of my service in the White House under President Bush, and now my service, again, under President Trump. The comparative analysis is unquestionable. We've got the strongest relations -- in fact, the strongest security relations -- at least counterterrorism security relations with the French ever.\nQ: Could you just tell me how the new friendship that we've seen over the past couple of days might change that intelligence-sharing or the -- what effect would that have?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, I think the intent to share and the intent to cooperate and collaborate is there and has been reaffirmed, which is a reassuring thing for the people of France and America. But I think that the relationship that the two Presidents have forged will increase the trust that's required for that information-sharing and that intelligence-sharing relationship. And I think that the conversations, in particular, in the extended bilateral that I attended, puts some additional details and framework on the strategic objectives for the sharing of that information and the vital interests that we're seeking to protect.\nQ: President Macron mentioned working together to fight propaganda and disinformation. Was that conversation in the context of Russia? And what are the U.S. and France doing together to combat disinformation campaigns and propaganda campaigns like the ones we've seen from Russia?\nMR. BOSSERT: So two questions there. The content and nature of the conversation between the two Presidents in the bilateral yesterday had to do with removing terrorist propaganda from social media sites and the Internet -- open Internet in general -- something -- an objective that both countries share.\nThe approach and the details now are going to require some additional work. Both Presidents agreed, and I have agreed to help at the staff level coordinate some additional conversations in that regard.\nI think some of the conversation now, in the community of likeminded, centers around whether we need to compel that removal and if there's a way to do such a thing, or whether we can work collaboratively and cooperatively with the companies and their providers to remove that kind of counterterrorism -- or terrorism propaganda from the Internet. I think that remains to be seen, but that was the nature of the conversation.\nQ: So was this conversation about counterterrorism propaganda not the kind of propaganda we saw, for instance, from the Russians during the election?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, the conversation about Russia didn't take place in the context of yesterday's bilateral conversation. The context of propaganda and its removal from the Internet yesterday was centered on the global jihadi problem.\nQ: Did the Iran nuclear deal come up? And can you talk about the reports that we're hearing from back home that you guys are ready to again certify that Iran is in compliance, which would keep the deal kind of in place for now?\nMR. BOSSERT: So, no, it didn't come up. And I'm unable to comment on the additional information you asked about. I'm not completely read in to what you're hearing or what you're reporting. But I do know the President and Secretary of State and others have discussed the matter, but I have no details to update you.\nQ: Back to the (inaudible) region, there's been some buzz that there might be some American troops kept in northern Iraq as like a stabilizing force or maybe a joint stabilizing force with other countries. Was that discussed at all -- you know, sort of the future of Iraq and whether a military presence in some form will be required?\nMR. BOSSERT: So the future security of the region in terms of troop presence but also generic commitments to a partnership were discussed, but the details of which I'll keep between the two Presidents, as I would the details of most of these topics, as they got into not only a detailed conversation but a fairly complex one. And so all I would say to that is, regional stability in a sustained, durable way did come up, but the details of that are to be continued.\nQ: Can you say if the Kurdish government has approached either Washington or Paris to have some troops left over?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, I can't and I won't. And I would ask, probably, that you talk to Secretary Mattis about that.\nQ: A judge in Hawaii has, once again, kind of narrowed the travel ban and kind of expanded who would be known as a bona fide relations to the U.S. to be able to get in. Does the administration have any response to that? Does that raise any concerns as far as security, et cetera?\nMR. BOSSERT: So I don't know if we have a formal administration response to that, but I will offer that I do have concerns with the early reporting. I haven't read the entire court holding or ruling.\nSo I would say that, as it was reported to me, it seemed to be fairly broad and something that would trouble me if it was as broad as reported. In terms of a connection with any group, any refugee organization, it might be read, if the early reports that I looked at were accurate, as something so expansive as to cover every refugee. And that certainly couldn't be the interpretation the Supreme Court intended.\nSo we'll have to go back and have the attorneys read it, interpret it further, and decide whether this is another productive or unproductive step in this saga as we try to secure our country.\nQ: On the travel ban, are there steps being taken to implement -- design and implement extreme vetting procedures? And also on the travel ban, is there a review going on to look at other countries to add to the banned list?\nMR. BOSSERT: So, as you know, there's a number of efforts ongoing to implement the President's executive order, especially now that it is been freed from legal constraint by the Supreme Court. The question you asked is about vetting. Of course, we're improving -- constantly, regularly -- our policies and our capabilities to better vet people seeking entry into the United States. And that's ongoing. We're unapologetic about that, and it contributes not only to our security, but to the hopeful relook in a comprehensive, strategic way at our immigration policy, not just our counterterrorism policy.\nQ: Are any specifics coming -- anything specific coming about changing the vetting procedures?\nMR. BOSSERT: So it's less about countries and more about the ability for people to demonstrate the paperwork and background information that we need to appropriately demonstrate that they have or don't have a security past that would concern us. So no additional conversations about countries, but conversations about people's background and whether they represent a security threat.\nQ: General Kelly had mentioned that they were thinking of asking people for social media passwords when they apply for visas, if they're coming from certain countries. Is there a process -- are you looking at a way to implement that formally?\nMR. BOSSERT: Actually, I can't add to that. I would say that Secretary Kelly owns and is responsible for that portion of the policy, and for implementing it. So if he commented on it, you've got it right from the horse's mouth, and I can't add to it. I don't have anything that I would try to add to it, but I would refer you back to Secretary Kelly on that.\nQ: Can I ask about the ceasefire in Syria? The President in the press conference yesterday talked a lot about how he saw that as a big success. So I'm wondering if you can talk about what kind of conversations have been going forward with the Russians since the G20 meeting, and also if there's any thought of expanding the, sort of, safe area, ceasefire?\nMR. BOSSERT: Sorry, no, I don't have too much more to add to add. But at the time of the extended bilateral conversation that the two Presidents had on this trip to Paris, we were on our fifth day of successful ceasefire, and both Presidents, both publicly and privately, were quite pleased with that development and hopeful that that would continue.\nQ: Are there any next steps planned with regard to your conversations with the French on Syria? I mean, where did you leave things off in terms of where we go?\nMR. BOSSERT: We left things off with a continued commitment to continue conversations. Unfortunately, that's about as much as I can add to it. But I would say that, as President Trump pointed out and I would reiterate, that continued conversations, even with countries who we don't always agree with, can sometimes produce positive results. In this case, the ceasefire has been a positive result.\nAnd both the French and American Presidents on this particular trip agreed on that approach to Russia, but also agreed that that's a positive result and that the French and American relationship on counterterrorism in Syria and throughout the Middle East, and internationally, would continue in a really strong way.\nIn fact, I think what we'll do together is develop our counterterrorism strategies together, with other likeminded allies as well, as we both come into power here about the same time, and the new French administration, the new American administration are starting on a good footing. I think that our counterterrorism strategy should start on a co-equal footing as well.\nQ: What do you say to critics who say that -- I'm sorry --\nQ: (Inaudible) what the President said about the Paris Accord yesterday and whether they talked about climate change, he and Macron?\nMR. BOSSERT: I can't elaborate on it, except to suggest -- or tell you that we didn't discuss any climate issues in the extended bilateral conversation that I attended. And the topic didn't chill or affect or any way come up verbally or through nonverbal cues in our conversations. They were very positive conversations and very upbeat relations between the two foreign leaders.\nQ: What do you say to critics who say that, when it comes to Syria, the U.S. has kind of let Russia set the agenda? Yes, you have the ceasefire, but it's kind of on the terms that Russia set. France and the U.S. have backed away from saying Assad has to leave. That, basically, that Russia will be able to continue to kind of have their influence in the country and that the U.S. is kind of just going along with what they wanted.\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, I don't agree with that assessment. I do agree that it's a positive development that there's a ceasefire, and I do believe that the French are very strong in their commitment, as is President Trump through his demonstrated airstrikes in not allowing anyone in the regime, Assad, to use chemical weapons against anyone. And any additional attempt to do that, certainly any use of chemical weapons in the future I'm sure would be met with a strong response from both President Trump and from President Macron.\nQ: Can you give us any more of the backstory of when President Trump was at the G20, met with Putin, they decided they were going to have this bilateral initiative on cybersecurity, and then President Trump tweeted that that was never going to happen? Can you just give us a better understanding of what that agreement actually was? Is it true that it's not getting off the ground? I mean, what happened there?\nMR. BOSSERT: I didn't attend the G20, so what I will tell you is that President Trump, I believe, is right in his continued assertion that even with countries with whom we have friction or disagreements, we have a responsibility on behalf of the American people to continue to have conversations to the extent that they can yield a positive result.\nAnd as his senior-most cybersecurity advisor, I will help him coordinate the Cabinet with Secretary Tillerson and others, Secretary Kelly, Mattis and Mnuchin and others, as we develop the appropriate level and contours of those conversations. But we'll have to set the rules for that. And I think it's a pretty important reminder that President Trump started that conversation by pointedly and exactingly telling President Putin that we will not have our elections messed with. That's unacceptable.\nMoving past that, we have to have a conversation about the rules of the road in cyberspace, norms and expectations. I'd like those same rules, norms and expectations to be part of our conversation as we discuss any potential future dialogue with the Russians in cybersecurity. And I'll help the President coordinate that among the right staff levels at the departments and agencies.\nQ: But given your expertise and the position you hold, do you feel that Russia is sincere in their efforts to partner on cyber, particularly after everything we've heard in the last year? Do you feel confident that they could actually pull this off in a sincere way?\nMR. BOSSERT: So, I'm not nitpicking your question, but I would say we are not discussing a partnership here. That is not what President Putin left the room for. That is certainly not what President Trump suggested. And that's not what I'm suggesting today. A partnership is a much different topic.\nWhat was broached at that G20 conversation, as I understand it, was an opportunity to continue a dialogue -- one that had in the past existed between the two countries, and I think one that we could pursue in the future with the appropriate reservations and the appropriate expectations, that we at least start with what is acceptable behavior in cyberspace and what norms and expectations that we'll have moving forward, long before you get into the enforcement of those rules or anywhere near before we get into a partnership.\nBut again, the instinct to make some progress on behalf of the American people and their security online is a good instinct on President Trump's part.\nQ: Why prematurely announce a dialogue if nothing is agreed upon on those subjects?\nMR. BOSSERT: I don't think anything was prematurely announced. I think the President was clear in saying that the conversation was raised and the idea was suggested, and that he was open to it. And I'm going to help him put the contours on that and give him some advice back on how we can frame that in a productive way without giving up any U.S. security and certainly without giving up any election security, which is President Trump's priority.\nQ: You said you didn't want to use the word \"partnership\" because it sounds like you're a little bit worried about the relationship. Can you tell us how you deal with the Russians at the lower -- not the presidential level -- when you're dealing with these delicate issues? How that's changed?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, the point -- the distinction I made was that a partnership suggests that you've reached a place where you believe that you have a trusted relationship and you've come to some common agreement on ideals and goals and behaviors. I don't believe that the United States and Russia have come to that point yet in cyberspace. And until we do, we wouldn't have the conversation about partnership. But we had to have a dialogue, and that's where we'll start.\nQ: The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice last year had dialogue with China about rules of the road for cybersecurity. Are you continuing that process? And is that a roadmap for discussions with Russia over rules of the road for hacking and cybersecurity?\nMR. BOSSERT: It's not a roadmap. Every country has their own unique conversations that they have to have. The nonbinding agreements that the Chinese made with the United States are still in place, and the United States has every expectation that they'll continue to meet those nonbinding agreements, the thrust of which was that no government engage in cyber espionage directed at commercial practices and commercial industry. And that's something that we would expect the Chinese to continue to honor. The United States is very serious about that.\nAnd I think that it's important to note that President Trump and President Xi continue to have a growing and strong relationship. So I would have no expectation that that would be reneged upon. And if it were, it's something I would advise the President -- President Trump -- that he raise to President Xi immediately. But for now, the conversation with the Chinese is one that's productive and is one that's built on some other mutual and common objectives and interests, and it is not a template or anything that I would use to compare our conversations and relations with the Russians.\nQ: Do you (inaudible) that China is abiding by those agreed-upon norms?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, I don't have any trend analysis to report today on whether China does or doesn't observe the norms. That's a very difficult thing to answer. But I believe that they have the commitment. I believe that they have the resolve to meet that commitment. And if I were to see trends that they were not meeting that commitment, I would advise the President to call him on that behavior.\nQ: Did immigration or refugee issues come up with President Macron? And if so, in what context? Where do they stand on that?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, no immigration or refugee issues came up specifically. But both Presidents did note, of course, that we had to be mindful of any fighters migrating to, and returning from, areas of active conflict in the global jihadi conflict in which we are on our 17th year.\nSo, thank you very much.\nEND 3:21 P.M.

It is wonderful to be here.\nTo Prime Minister Trudeau, Governor McAuliffe -- thank you for that warm introduction and that warm welcome -- to Governor Sandoval, to all the Governors of these United States, especially our host, to Gina Raimondo, to all the distinguished guests who are here with us today -- it is an honor to be back in Rhode Island at the 109th annual Summer Meeting of the National Governors Association. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings today from my friend, a champion of federalism who is fighting every single day to restore power to the states and to the people, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President is actually returning as we speak from France, where he celebrated America's first and oldest alliance with great pageantry and a productive meeting. I spoke to the President aboard Air Force One this morning, and he asked me to convey his thanks to all of you for your service to your states and to give you his best regards. And our President sent me and several members of our Cabinet here to reaffirm our administration's commitment to partner with each and every one of you to advance the security and prosperity of all of the American people and all of the states across this country. (Applause.)\nFor me, it's great to be back at the NGA. I'm, frankly, very humbled -- very humbled to be with so many of the leaders I had the privilege to serve with when I was governor of the state of Indiana. It's amazing for me to think -- my wife and I reflected on it this morning -- that it was one year ago this weekend that the phone call came, and my life changed. I reflected this morning on that ancient verse that I often thought about in those days: Who am I, oh Lord, and who is my family that you brought me this far.\nSo let me just take this personal opportunity to say thank you to all of you. Thank you for your friendship, your encouragement, and the prayers that have enabled us to serve in this new capacity. It is great to be back with America's governors. (Applause.)\nI'm here as your Vice President, but I want you to know that I bring the perspective of a former governor, to your discussions this weekend. When I was a governor, I'd often come to Washington, D.C. representing my state's interest, and my greatest hope was that I'd have an administration that would listen to me and work with me to improve the lives of the hardworking people of Indiana. Well let me give you this promise: Every governor in America has all that and more in President Donald Trump.\nYou heard it from the President himself when he addressed the NGA at the White House during your winter meeting earlier this year. As the President said, \"Under my administration, we're going to have a true partnership of collaboration and cooperation with the states.\" And he meant every word of it.\nSince day one of our administration, President Trump has been delivering on this promise. In the past six months, President Trump has met with governors from no fewer than 47 states, individually, and five territories -- including all of you that are gathered here today. In June alone, President Trump welcomed 19 governors to the White House, and he met with three more on the road. President Trump has involved you in our policy discussions, and let me assure you, this President values your continued input on issues ranging from infrastructure to energy to tax cuts to healthcare and so much more.\nAnd if you haven't noticed, this President likes to hire governors. (Laughter.) Not just present company, but I'm talking about our United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley; Secretary of Energy Rick Perry; our Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue; and the new United States Ambassador to China, who was the longest-serving Governor in American history, Ambassador Terry Branstad. Let's give all these former governors a round of applause. (Applause.)\nIt really has been a privilege for me to continue to work so closely with all of you on the President's behalf. In February, Karen and I enjoyed welcoming many of you to the Vice President's Residence in Washington, D.C. -- the first time all of America's governors, I was told, have ever been invited to the Naval Observatory, and we were honored that so many came.\nNow my wife couldn't be with us today. She's picking our daughter up from the airport -- been doing some foreign travel. But let me personally extend the President's and our family's heartfelt appreciation to the most important people in the room today: the spouses and family members of those who serve as governors across this nation. Could you give a round of applause to our spouses and family members that support the leadership of these great leaders? (Applause.)\nThe truth is, America's governors have a friend in President Donald Trump, and it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. And this President's agenda will strengthen every state across this country. I like to say that our President has a three-part agenda: Jobs, jobs, and jobs. And to be around him for any period of time, you know he's focused on prosperity in this country, as more than anything else other than security.\nThe President has taken decisive action from the outset of this administration to put America back to work and get our economy moving again. This President has signed more laws slashing job-killing red tape out of Washington, D.C. than any President in American history. It's already saved businesses and individuals up to $18 billion a year in regulatory cost.\nAnd our President has been busy unleashing American energy. He's opening the way for more offshore drilling, rolling back the Clean Power Plan, and the President has approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines to strengthen the energy infrastructure of this nation. And speaking of infrastructure, President Trump has already begun the process of rebuilding American infrastructure. And in partnership with governors like you, I promise you, before this session of Congress is out, we're going to pass an infrastructure bill that will rebuild America, and we're going to work with each and every one of you to bring that about. (Applause.)\nThis President has also taken decisive action to ensure that America's trade deals are both free and fair. Thanks to the President's leadership, last month American companies were able to ship American beef to China for the first time in over 13 years.\nThe President has also opened up a new economic dialogue he asked me to lead with the nation of Japan, to strengthen our trade relationship with our valued ally.\nAnd in the coming weeks, President Trump, and our nation will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And under this President's leadership, we will modernize NAFTA for the 21st century so it is a win-win-win for all of our trading partners in North America. (Applause.)\nNow I know you'll be hearing from Prime Minister Trudeau in just a few minutes. And let me assure you the United States and Canada have already built a remarkably strong relationship under these two leaders, and the investment relationship that we enjoy today is worth more than $620 billion a year. And we're grateful for the Prime Minister's leadership and his early outreach to this administration. President Trump recognized that every trade relationship can improve, and as the Prime Minister knows, we're looking forward to bringing NAFTA into the future in a way that will equally benefit both our countries.\nThe truth is, President Trump's leadership is already making a difference, and I know you see it in your states every single day. Under this President's watch, businesses large and small have already created more than 800,000 new private sector jobs since the first of this year. Company after company are making record investments in state after state -- billions of dollars, tens of thousands of jobs. And the stock market is soaring, closing at record highs again this week.\nAnd with the continued input of America's governors, President Trump is going to work with this Congress to drive forward an agenda for a more prosperous America of lower taxes, less regulation, more American energy, better infrastructure, better trade deals and yes, President Donald Trump is going to lead this Congress to rescue the American people from the collapsing policies of Obamacare. (Applause.)\nAs a former governor myself, I know just how important healthcare is to each and every one of you as you lead your states. The simple truth, though, is Obamacare is imploding all across America, and working families and small businesses are paying the price every day. Our administration has found that the average premium on the individual market has more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect less than four years ago, and in many states, including some represented here, it's more than tripled.\nWhen Obamacare passed, we were promised that families would save up to $2,500 in premiums, but the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than the average plan did in 2013. And while costs are skyrocketing, choices are plummeting.\nOn Monday, our administration announced that 38 percent fewer health insurers plan on participating in Obamacare exchanges next year, and the number could rise, leaving millions of Americans with even fewer choices. And come next year, 40 percent of American counties, including nine whole states, will have only one choice in a health insurance provider, meaning they essentially have no choice at all. Even worse, dozens of counties will have no health insurance providers whatsoever on the Obamacare exchange in 2018.\nI know you know these facts, because as governors you're living that reality, not far afield in Washington, D.C. looking at statistics, but you're seeing the impact of these failed policies each and every day in communities and enterprises across your state. I don't have to tell any of the governors gathered around here, whatever your politics, whatever your party, you know we're talking about real people and you know we're talking about a real crisis. Because behind every number is a name, and behind every name is a story.\nSince early this year, the President has had me traveling across the country to many of your states, and I've always made a point to sit down with your local citizens and local businesses to hear the story about the hardship that Obamacare has placed in your communities. I've heard stories from small-business owners, working families, and parents with disabled children who have suffered terribly under the collapsing weight of this policy. People like Julie Roberts, who I met with earlier this week in Lexington, Kentucky. At her small business, premiums have spiked 25 percent every year under Obamacare and deductibles have tripled.\nThen there's Connie Mays, who has lived in the same small town in Ohio her entire life. She has a disability she told me about. It's made her life tough, but she's found her way forward. But when Obamacare became law, she told me that she lost her health insurance plan, she lost her doctor, and today no healthcare provider in her county will take her Obamacare coverage. So she essentially has no coverage at all. She literally had tears in her eyes sitting next to me at the White House when she told me the story that that card in her pocketbook was essentially meaningless because no one in her home county would take it.\nThere's Julie Champine from Wisconsin, who I met when I was visiting Governor Walker, whose health insurance costs increased so much that last year she told me with genuine emotion in her voice that she had to choose between paying for her Obamacare coverage and buying Christmas presents for her grandkids. She literally took that preemptive three months where she could skip making her payments and skip coverage just so she could afford to buy some Christmas presents for her kids and grandkids.\nI don't have to tell all of you. I mean, these stories are not rare, but they're all heartbreaking. They're not the exception, they're the rule. But as I told each and every one of those that I mentioned and people all across this country: Help is on the way. We're going to give the American people access to the kind of world-class healthcare every American deserves. (Applause.)\nI'm pleased to report, as you already know, just yesterday Senate leadership unveiled a new version of the Senate healthcare bill, and President Trump and I urge every member of the Senate to support it. President Trump and I believe the Senate healthcare bill is the right bill at the right time to begin the end of Obamacare and rescue the American people from this failed policy. And we look forward to the Senate taking up this bill as early as next week.\nNow, President Trump laid out his vision for American healthcare months ago. The President said he wanted a healthcare system that in his words is \"far less expensive and far better.\" And we believe the Senate healthcare bill begins to make the President's vision a reality.\nThe bill introduced in the Senate puts America back on the path to better, more affordable healthcare for every American. The Senate healthcare bill repeals Obamacare's individual and business mandates, and cuts taxes on American families and American businesses, restoring freedom and it will create jobs.\nThe Senate healthcare bill doubles the contribution limits for health savings accounts. And for the first time ever, it allows health savings accounts to cover insurance premiums. The bill also offers tax credits to help Americans buy the coverage they want at a price they can afford. And the legislation ensures that every American with preexisting conditions has access to the coverage and care they need -- no exceptions. (Applause.)\nAnd if you take nothing else from what I say today, know that the Senate healthcare bill gives states the freedom to redesign your health insurance markets. And, most significantly, under this legislation, states across the country will have an unprecedented level of flexibility to reform Medicaid and bring better coverage, better care, and better outcomes to the most vulnerable in your states.\nNow, I'm not speaking so much right now as your Vice President, but let me speak to you as a former governor and as someone who Terry McAuliffe pointed out -- I made the decision in Indiana to expand Medicaid under a waiver. I mean, you all know your states, you know your people. You know how to create the innovative solutions to address the unique healthcare needs of the people of your states. And I had that very same attitude when I was a governor.\nBut most of you also know that, under previous administrations -- frankly, in both political parties -- it's been difficult, if not at times impossible, for states to act on your own ideas. I actually learned that firsthand.\nRight after I was elected governor, in early 2013, I went straight to work developing a serious Medicaid reform plan that would put vulnerable and low-income Hoosiers more in charge of their own healthcare decisions that would expand access to healthcare providers across the state.\nWorking with a remarkably talented woman whom I'm proud to say is now the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we created a plan based on consumer-directed healthcare. Indiana at the time, as some of you know, was home to a small pilot project that had promising results in that area. And we believed that we could expand coverage in the state the Indiana way, in ways that would improve access and improve healthcare outcomes for our most vulnerable. And we went straight to work.\nBut when we submitted our waiver to the prior administration to implement our plan, we -- as many of you can attest in prior administrations -- we encountered roadblocks and bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.\nIt took our state more than two years for the federal government to approve our waiver. And even then, they, frankly, rejected an awful lot of what we were trying to do. I know many of you have submitted waiver requests over recent years to Washington, D.C. and had the same result.\nNow, President Trump and I both believe that governors should have the freedom to design and implement the reforms in healthcare that will work in your states. And we're going to fight to make that a reality in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nPresident Donald Trump is dedicated to getting the federal government out of your way and allowing you to develop those unique solutions that will work for the people of your state. As the President told you in February, the federal government, in his words, should be not in your way but working with you to deliver needed reforms and services. And that's our commitment again today.\nNow, tomorrow you're going to hear from Secretary Tom Price from the Department of Health and Human Services, who accompanied me here today, and Administrator Seema Verma about our President's commitment to work with each and every one of you. Earlier this year, they sent a letter to every governor in America, in their words, to affirm the President's partnership with all of your states.\nAnd I got to tell you -- and I hope you've already had this experience -- Secretary Tom Price and Administrator Seema Verma, we've got the A-team. They're fighting for you. They're fighting for the states' ability to innovate and meet the needs of our most vulnerable, and improve our healthcare system. And I'd like you to give them a round of applause. (Applause.)\nAs you've heard from those Cabinet officials, and I'm here to say again today: Our administration wants you to innovate. We want you to improve your own health insurance markets and strengthen your Medicaid programs. And I promise you that this administration will work with you in a timely way so that you can move forward with the policies and plans that are best for your states and your citizens.\nAnd a case in point: Just a few days ago, Administrator Verma approved a state innovation waiver for Alaska to lower premiums and improve access to care for thousands of Alaskans. And, Governor, we commend you for your leadership.\nOur administration is committed to working with you as partners. And the good news is that the Senate's healthcare bill will expand state freedom and flexibility to an even greater degree than the law permits our administration to extend today. The bill actually rolls back restrictions on waivers, giving states the ability to stabilize your insurance markets after they've been virtually destroyed in recent years.\nAnd when it comes to Medicaid, not only does the Senate's healthcare bill expand state flexibility, it ensures that every state in America has the resources you need to take care of your most vulnerable.\nAs a former governor who expanded Medicaid in our state with consumer-directed healthcare, I have to tell you I understand and appreciate, as the President does, the concerns that many of you have as we talk about Medicaid in the future going forward. Our administration has paid very close attention to this issue, and we've had discussions with governors around this room and around the country.\nSo let me be clear: President Trump and I believe the Senate healthcare bill strengthens and secures Medicaid for the neediest in our society. And this bill puts this vital America program on a path to long-term sustainability.\nUnder the Senate healthcare bill, federal Medicaid spending will be $300 billion to $500 billion higher over the next decade relative to current amounts, ensuring that our states have the ability to provide for the most vulnerable and give them the care that they're counting on.\nAnd when it comes to receiving this funding, your states will have two options -- a per-capita cap or a block grant.\nThe per-capita cap gives each state the money you need to cover Medicaid's traditional beneficiaries, who need the most assistance.\nAnd with the block grant option, you'll be able to determine how to best use your Medicaid dollars. And you can provide for your most vulnerable in ways that's best for your state.\nAt the same time, the Senate healthcare bill creates a stability fund in addition to that that states can use to help people obtain personal coverage as they transition out of the Medicaid expansion.\nPeople on Medicaid will be eligible for the new tax credits, which will help them purchase the affordable coverage that's right for them.\nThe truth is that these reforms are long overdue.\nUnder Obamacare, the Medicaid expansion costs 50 percent more per enrollee than what we were told. At this very moment, Medicaid is one of the largest and fastest growing budget items in nearly every state budget. But you already know that. And as Medicaid grows, there's less and less money for schools, for roads, and for public safety.\nThe truth is for a long time Medicaid has been a broken system that's been fundamentally unsustainable, and the expansion that occurred Obamacare only made the system worse.\nThis just can't continue. That's why the Senate healthcare bill puts Medicaid on a budget for the first time in its history -- ensuring for the long run that Medicaid will be there for the neediest in our society.\nObamacare has put far too many able-bodied adults on the Medicaid rolls, leaving many disabled and vulnerable Americans at the back of the line. It's true, and it's heartbreaking. I know Governor Kasich isn't with us, but I suspect that he's very troubled to know that in Ohio alone, nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists, leaving them without the care they need for months or even years.\nJust a few weeks ago at the White House, I met just such a family from a state that had expanded Medicaid. Christine and Jacob Chalkey. They're a beautiful family, but they have a heartbreaking story, and it's one that America needs to hear.\nJacob is Christine's son, a courageous young man in his early 20s. He has a rare disability, and for nearly his entire life, he depended on Medicaid in his state for the medicine that he needs.\nBut a few years back, when their state expanded traditional Medicaid, the state also announced that they were going to cut back on coverage for medication like Jacob's.\nOne day, Christine told me with tears in her eyes, as well, that she got a letter in the mail saying that the state would no longer pay for Jacob's medicine. The family tried as hard as they could to get enough money together, but they just couldn't do it. They had to switch to a different, cheaper alternative that might not work.\nAnd sure enough, it didn't. Young Jake's health began to fail, she told me. He even lost his ability to see, to walk, and to talk. Only by the grace of God did he regain these skills and a loving family was there at his side. But every day is now a struggle for him and their family.\nJake is not alone. The truth is I've heard from special-needs families as I've traveled all across this country, and they've told me again and again that unless we reform Medicaid, our most vulnerable are going to continue to be crowded out of coverage that they rely on and depend on.\nI don't have to ask any one of you to know where your hearts are on this issue. You know Medicaid was created in the very instances of its founding to support the aged, the blind, the disabled, and vulnerable children. And unless we bring about needful reforms that you alone in your state know how to best implement, we're going to continue to see scarce resources crowd out the help that our most vulnerable need. And I know that no one around this table, no one sitting in a governor's office in our states or territories wants that to happen.\nThis demands a compassionate response. I know all of you care deeply about those families. You want to provide for them and give them the best shot at a better life.\nI say that with confidence because I know all of you. Beyond the politics that may separate us, I have to tell you that being among governors was one of the most inspiring times in my season of public service. Because as Gina and I were talking earlier, governors are doers. You roll your sleeves up. More often than not, you just check your politics at the door and go figure out how to solve problems. And this room is filled with men and women who are problem-solvers.\nSo I want to say this is your chance. The Senate healthcare bill restores Medicaid to its original purpose -- caring for the disabled, the blind, the low-income elderly, pregnant women, and children. And we can put you back in the driver's seat to making sure that it does just that.\nI really believe, as the President does, that we're saving Medicaid for the sake of our most vulnerable and all that depend on it. We're providing all Americans with access to the high quality and affordable health insurance with the reforms that are moving through Congress today.\nThis really is about caring for the least among us, and it's about doing the right thing. And at the end of the day, I know in my heart of hearts the men and women around this table, and everyone in public service at every level longs to do just that.\nBefore I leave, I'd like to mention one more accomplishment in the Senate healthcare bill that I know is of great interest and has already been a subject of discussion appropriately at this gathering of the National Governors Association. I'm pleased to report that the new Senate healthcare bill provides unprecedented new resources to address the opioid crisis that's ravaging our states and communities across this nation. (Applause.)\nThe President and I are grateful for each one of your leadership on this issue. And in my days back in the Hoosier State, I sat around kitchen tables with families that were dealing with the loss of a loved one to opioid addiction, or dealing with the long, long road back from opioid addiction and abuse.\nNow you all would be glad to know that President Trump has made a priority of this administration to end the scourge of opioid addiction in this country. He knows the impact that it has on families, and we're determined in this administration to bring the full resources of the national government to bear on assisting you as you come alongside these families.\nPresident Trump has been giving our law enforcement community at every level the resources and backing they need to go after this on the law enforcement side. We've been getting gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminals like MS-13 off the streets of our cities at an unprecedented pace. The President has also created a commission devoted to addressing the opioid crisis because we know that we have to meet this crisis not just with law enforcement but also with compassion and with new resources for those that are caught up in the scourge of addiction.\nWith this President's support, the Senate healthcare bill unveiled yesterday a remarkable $45 billion in new federal resources to confront opioid abuse and addiction in our states. (Applause.)\nAnd when this bill is signed into law, every state in America will benefit from this funding. And passing this bill is a vital step to help those who suffer in the grip of addiction, our communities, and our country, and put our entire nation back on the road to healing.\nAs the Governor and I were just talking a moment ago, once again in your state, after Congress passed the Cures Act last year, you're going to have the ability with these new resources to look at issues like not only treatment, but also treatment centers to build further capacity in your states to make resources available for people and their families to deal with the scourge of addition. And we know your leadership will make a difference in lives.\nThe bottom line: That the Senate healthcare act provides for the most vulnerable in our society. It improves and strengthens Medicaid. It gives you, America's governors, the flexibility you need to bring better care, better coverage, and better outcomes to the citizens of your states. The President and I truly believe it will be a historic day for American healthcare when the President has the privilege to sign this bill into law. And we commend it. We commend this bill to your attention, and we ask for your support.\nBut today, I want to ask all of you to continue to work with us to build on the good work being done in this Congress on healthcare and on so many other issues. I want to challenge each one of you to work together with this administration to give the American people access to the world-class healthcare they deserve and to move forward the kind of policies that will strengthen our nation, strengthen our economy, and advance the security and safety of the American people.\nBut we truly do believe now is the time to act in the Congress in healthcare reform for the sake of the American people. Now is the time to usher in a new era of state-based innovation. Now is the time to make the best healthcare system the world even better.\nAnd as I close, let me again thank you for the warm welcome today and the good fellowship. When I arrived today one of my colleagues asked me if I missed you. And the truth is, I do. The privilege of serving as a governor of the state I grew up in was the greatest privilege of my life till that phone rang a year ago this weekend.\nBut there's something special about governors, and I want you to know that President Trump and I know it. And we're just determined to seize this moment in the life of our nation to advance the interests and the well-being of people of our country. And we ask for your support.\nAnd as I ask it, I say with confidence that I know we will succeed as we confront the challenges in healthcare and beyond because I have faith.\nSo with boundless faith in the American people, with faith in you men and women in this room who lead the great states of this Union, with faith in our President's vision and determination, and with faith in God who has ever watched over this Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, I say with confidence: We will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. We will give Americans the opportunity to have access to world-class healthcare again. And to borrow a phrase, working with all of you on behalf of all of the American people, we will Make America Great Again.\nThank you very much. God bless you for your service to this nation. God bless your states and God bless the United States of America.

Obamacare has wreaked havoc on American lives, and if we don't replace it, the calamity will only get worse, and I mean, get worse by a lot.\nHere is just one story, representative of so many others. Carrie Couey and her husband are cattle ranchers. They have six children, and the youngest is autistic. Her family's rates under Obamacare skyrocketed, eventually costing the Coueys three times more than their previous plan. They were dropped from health insurance four times under Obamacare.\nWhen I met with Carrie in March, she told us that her family couldn't afford the equipment they needed to do the jobs while paying these crushing insurance premiums. Americans like Carrie and her family desperately need relief from this terrible, terrible law.\nThe Democratic politicians who passed Obamacare made many big promises, but they turned out to be lies, absolute, total lies. They promised Obamacare would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, premiums have skyrocketed by numbers that nobody can even believe, sometimes, many, many thousands of dollars. They promised that if you like your plan, you could keep your plan; instead, millions of American families saw their plans canceled.\nThey promised Obamacare would offer better options for American families, but in the past 2 years, half the insurance companies have pulled out and left the individual market. And today, Americans in one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and they, probably, will shortly have no insurers at all.\nThe Senate health care bill stops the Obamacare disaster, expands choice, and drives down costs, and I want to tell you, the Republican Senators are working very hard to get something that's going to be really, really good, the opposite of the big lie which was Obamacare.\nThe bill would reduce premiums by 30 percent or more by 2020. It allows States freedom to escape even more of Obamacare's rules and create innovative health care solutions for their citizens. In other words, we'll be taking something away from the Federal Government and getting it back to the States, who can better provide and who know better what to do.\nIt provides generous funding for people with expensive health conditions, which will lower premiums in the individual market. The bill doubles the amount that Americans can contribute to tax-free health savings accounts and allows you to use those accounts to pay your premiums.\nThis plan provides States with the much-needed flexibility to better manage their Medicaid programs. It maintains Medicaid coverage for every single elderly American, disabled American, and American child who is currently on the program. It also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with Federal financial assistance.\nAnd with these much-needed, long-term reforms to strengthen the safety net for our neediest citizens, the Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan would significantly reduce the Federal deficit. So it would be good for the Federal Government, it will cost you less money by a lot, and it will be a much better plan. You can't do better than that. When I ran for President, I made a commitment to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare. I am pleased to report that we are very, very close to ending this health care nightmare. We are so close.\nThe legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want, the affordability they need, and the quality they deserve in health care. It's a commonsense approach that restores the sacred doctor-patient relationship. And you're going to finally have great health care at a lower price.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-07-14", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Thank you, Pastor John Hagee, Ambassador Dermer, distinguished members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow believers and friends, it is humbling for me to be before you today to join you at the 12th annual summit of the largest pro-Israel organization in the United States of America -- Christians United for Israel! (Applause.)\nIt's great to be back with so many friends. And to all of you -- I bring greetings from another friend. I just left him a few moments ago. He is a leader, a believer, and a tireless friend of the Jewish state of Israel -- the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThanks to the support of so many in this room and your prayers, last November President Trump won a historic victory -- more counties than any President since Ronald Reagan, 30 of 50 states -- no Republican had carried in a generation. The truth is President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red, and you made it happen. (Applause.)\nNow as the Good Book says: If you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect. And I'm really here on the President's behalf and on our entire team's behalf to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped elect a President who is fighting every single day to defend faith, restore freedom, and strengthen America's unbreakable bond with our most cherished ally, Israel. (Applause.)\nJust last month, President Trump made a historic visit to Israel. I know all of you were watching from afar. One of the very first countries our President visited since he took office, standing in Jerusalem, in that ancient and holy city, our President declared for all the world to hear that under his leadership, the United States of America \"will always stand with Israel.\" (Applause.)\nIn Jerusalem, our President said that the bond between America and Israel in his words \"is woven together in the hearts of our people\" -- and Christians United for Israel proves this statement true every single day all across this country.\nYou know, it was only 11 years ago that my friend Pastor John Hagee had the courage and the vision to unite American Christians to rally around those ancient words \"for Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.\" And, Pastor John Hagee, I thank you for your leadership on behalf of this nation and the Jewish state of Israel. (Applause.)\nAnd today, through Christians United for Israel, more than 3.3 million believers have raised their voices, have not been silent in support of Israel, and you can be heard in every city and town across America and in every office on Capitol Hill. And rest assured, the man down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue hears you, too. (Applause.)\nNow for my part, Karen and I have always treasured our relationship with Christians United for Israel. I had the honor to speak to this great group when I was a member of Congress. I worked hand-in-hand with CUFI when I was governor of the state of Indiana. And with the support and prayers of men and women gathered in this room, I'm proud to say in my last year as governor, it was my great privilege to sign one of the strongest anti-BDS laws in the America to ensure that our state never does business with those who seek to inflict financial damage on Israel. (Applause.) Because boycott, divestment, and sanctions have no place in my home state and no place in America. (Applause.)\nIt's humbling to stand before you today for another reason because it was just one year ago this past weekend that the phone rang at the governor's residence, and there was a familiar voice on other line. And I remember when that call came and when the invitation came to join this national ticket, I couldn't help but think of that ancient verses: Who am I and who is my family, that you've brought me this far?\nSo tonight, let me just take a moment to thank all of you men and women of CUFI, and all those you represent around America, thank you for your friendship, your support, and your prayers every step of the way on the journey my little family has taken throughout my career. It's hard for me to express before you friends of so many years the humility and gratitude I feel today to stand before you today as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. (Applause.)\nMy friends, to look at Israel is to see that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob keeps his promises, keeps the promises He makes to His people and to each one of us.\nEzekiel prophesized: \"Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.\" And the State of Israel and her people bear witness to God's faithfulness, as well as their own.\nHow unlikely was Israel's birth, how more unlikely has been her survival, and how confounding, against the odds, has been her thriving.\nSince the moment of their independence, the Jewish people have awed the world with their strength of will and their strength of character.\nIndeed, anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear must acknowledge that Israel is a living testimony to the power of hope over hate and so will she always be. (Applause.)\nThe Jewish people have turned the desert into a garden, sickness into health, scarcity into plenty, despair into hope, and slander into blessings -- rebuking all who condemn them; not for what they do wrong, but for what they do right.\nAnd under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this: America stands with Israel. Now and always. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I stand with Israel for the same reason every freedom-loving American stands with Israel -- because her cause is our cause, her values are our values, and her fight is our fight.\nAnd President Trump is actually a lifelong friend of Israel. I've seen his passion firsthand in the President's deep affection for Israel. The morning after the election, I was actually in the room when Prime Minister Netanyahu called to congratulate the President on his great victory. I heard President Trump express his unwavering support for Israel and the Jewish people that morning, support he reiterated when he welcomed the Prime Minister to the White House.\nAnd just last month, the world saw our President's commitment to Israel during that visit to Jerusalem, when President Donald Trump declared that America's \"deep and lasting friendship\" with Israel will only in his words \"grow deeper and stronger as we work together in the days ahead.\" (Applause.)\nFor my part, like all of you, my passion for Israel springs from my Christian faith. The songs of the land and the people of Israel were the anthems of my youth. As for me and my house, we pray for the peace of Jerusalem and all who call her home. It's really the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply for our most cherished ally.\nAnd let me say with confidence to all gathered here and to all of the watching world, President Trump and I stand without apology for Israel today. We will stand without apology for Israel tomorrow, and President Donald Trump and I will stand with the Israel always -- of that you may be assured. (Applause.)\nYou just need to look at the actions our President has taken since he took office. Like when he named Governor Nikki Haley to be America's Ambassador to the United Nations. (Applause.)\nAt the President's direction, Ambassador Haley has been standing up for America and she's been standing up for Israel. And as Ambassador Haley said just a short while ago, in her words, \"The days of Israel-bashing at the United Nations are over.\" (Applause.)\nAnd the President also named David Friedman to represent our country in Israel as our ambassador. David is an unabashed advocate for a stronger America-Israel relationship, and our friendship is already stronger with him in our embassy in Israel.\nAnd to the men and women of Christians United for Israel, this President hears you. This President stands with you. And I promise you that the day will come when President Donald Trump moves the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It is not a question of if, it is only when. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump is also personally committed to helping the parties resolve the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In addition to his own visit to Israel, the President has dispatched several of his top advisors to help guide negotiations. But our President I can assure knows any peace requires an end to the incitement of hatred, an end to any support whatsoever of terrorism. And above all else, a lasting peace requires true and complete Palestinian willingness to accept and recognize the Jewish state of Israel. (Applause.)\nAnd while there will undoubtedly have to be compromises, let me assure all of you gathered here today, President Donald Trump will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish state of Israel -- not now, not ever. (Applause.)\nSince the moment of its birth, there has hardly been a day when Israelis have lived without war, or the fear of war, or the grim reality of terror. We were reminded of this just last Friday, when three gunmen ambushed a group of Israeli police officers in the very heart of Jerusalem. Two brave officers were murdered in this barbaric act of terrorism. We mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve. We grieve with the families of these fallen heroes of Israel, and the prayers of our President, our family, and all who cherish Israel are with these heroic law enforcement officers and their families. (Applause.)\nAnd so is our resolve. President Trump has made it clear: America stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel, as together we confront those enemies who threaten our people, our freedom, and our very way of life.\nAmerica and Israel are united together as friends and allies in the West. Just a few weeks ago, in Warsaw, Poland -- home to so much Jewish history, and so much Jewish heartache, our President defined our struggle with moral clarity, courage, and vision more than any President since Ronald Reagan when President Trump declared in his words: \"The West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.\" (Applause.)\nWe will triumph because our courage and conviction cannot be matched, and for that matter, neither can our strength.\nToday, America's support for Israel's security is at record levels. And America now has a President who is fighting every day to rebuild our military.\nAnd under President Donald Trump I promise you we're going to rebuild this military. We're going to restore the arsenal of democracy. And we're once again going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need and deserve to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.)\nIn President Trump, America once again has a leader who will stand with our allies and stand up to our enemies. And this President calls our enemies by their name. And at this very moment I'm proud to report, the Armed Forces of the United States of America are taking the fight to ISIS terrorist on our terms and on their soil. And under this Commander-in-Chief, we will continue to fight ISIS until we wipe them off the face of the Earth. (Applause.)\nAnd under President Trump America will continue to stand strong, continue to stand strong in the face of the leading state sponsor of terrorism. President Trump has put Iran on notice: America will no longer tolerate Iran's efforts to destabilize the region and jeopardize Israel's security.\nAnd let me be clear on this point: Under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will not allow Iran to develop a useable nuclear weapon. This is our solemn promise to the American people, to the people of Israel, and to the world. (Applause.)\nSo we stand with Israel. We stand with Israel today and every day, because the American people throughout our history have always cherished Israel.\nWe stand with Israel because our bond was knit millennia ago in the finery of faith. And we stand with Israel because millions of Americans throughout the generations of this country have embraced that ancient truth and admonition that He will bless those who bless her, and he will curse those who curse her.\nIndeed, though Israel was built by human hands, it is impossible not to sense that just beneath its history, lies the hand of heaven. (Applause.)\nOver the mantle of our home, since the year I was first elected to Congress, are framed words that have long inspired my family. We had them over the fireplace in our home in a small town in southern Indiana. We had them over the fireplace at the governor's residence in Indianapolis, and now they hang over the mantle of the home of the Vice President of the United States.\nThey're words of confidence and faith. They're words to which my family has repaired to as generations of Americans have done so throughout our history, and the people of Israel through all their storied history have clung. They come from the Book of Jeremiah, and it simply reads: \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.\"\nThese words are as true today for all people of faith as they were in millennia past. And so I encourage you to embrace them. I urge the men and women of Christians United for Israel to cling to that hope and that promise, and I urge you to do particularly what you've done exceedingly well these many years, to continue to bow the head, to bend the knee, and to pray. Pray for our most cherished ally. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem and pray that God will continue to bless America.\nAnd when you pray, pray with confidence because our God is a faithful God, and He will guide us, and He will guard us as we go forth and do His work. (Applause.)\nAnd so I thank you for the honor of joining you once again in this new capacity. And I close tonight saying simply from my heart as I look out on this shining crowd, and I see the support that you represent all across this country for our most cherished ally. And I have faith. I have faith that with God's help and with the men and women gathered here, with all those who cherish Israel, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, the best days for Israel and for America together are yet to come. (Applause.)\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the Jewish state of Israel and God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "note": "This press briefing was \"off-camera\" and no video was permitted by the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126672", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:32 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Sorry I'm a little late.\nQ: Good to see you.\nQ: We miss you, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I miss you too.\nGood afternoon. For the rest of July, this administration is going to be honoring the people, the products, and the principles that have made America a global leader. This week, we will be spotlighting American-made products and industries. Later on in the month, we'll also be highlighting American heroes and the American Dream.\nSince day one, the President has been fighting for the hardworking people of this country, and he has done a lot on their behalf. He signed an executive order to Buy American and Hire American, which is a historic action to ensure that federal projects are made with American goods, and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts by countries that break the rules. He took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first. We continue to make progress on that. He withdrew the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership and began renegotiating NAFTA.\nWhether it's removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders, or unleashing American energy, the President is working to keep his promises and deliver for the America's workers.\nSo, today, as I mentioned, we're kicking off \"American Made\" week with a showcase of 50 products that are made here in the United States, representing each of the 50 states. From the South Lawn to the State Floor, the White House will be lined with these examples of American innovation and investment in manufacturing and technology.\nFrom the SH-3 Sea King helicopter made in Connecticut, which most of us affectionately know as Marine One when the President is on board, to the iconic cowboy hats made in Texas, this country is already responsible for the invention and creation of an incredible span of amazing products.\nBut for decades, Washington has been doing its best to discourage these companies from investing here at home, through job-killing deals and a rapidly expanding scheme of unnecessary regulations. This administration has been working hard to ease these burdens, making it easier for companies to compete and grow so they can contribute more to our economy and hire more American workers.\nWe've already created over 50,000 new manufacturing jobs this year. And as the President moves forward with his pro-growth agenda, including repealing and replacing Obamacare, reforming our over-complicated tax code, and revitalizing our nation's crumbling infrastructure, that number is sure to grow even higher.\nWe hope that the companies represented here today and the rest of the businesses who put Americans to work manufacturing their products will see the numbers grow as the Trump administration continues to unleash American industry.\nIn about a half-hour, the President will head out to the South Lawn to view some of the larger products, like a forklift from Mississippi and a fire truck from Wisconsin. He'll then proceed to the Blue Room and continue along the State Floor to see everything from California wine to body armor manufactured in Iowa. He will then make remarks and sign a proclamation declaring July 17th as Made in America Day.\nThe Vice President, Cabinet members, members of Congress, and White House senior staff are also visiting the state displays throughout the rest of the afternoon.\nLater in the week, the President will host a Made in America Certification Event and attend the commissioning the USS Gerald R. Ford in Newport News, Virginia.\nAlso here today, the Departments of Transportation and Energy are making important investments in domestic air travel and the new generation of bioenergy. The FAA will award over $290 million as part of its Airport Investment [Improvement] Program to 105 airports in 38 states. These grants fund various types of projects, including runways, taxiways, and airport signage, which makes our airports safer and will create thousands of jobs.\nAnd the Department of Energy will award $40 million for the establishment of four Department of Energy Bioenergy Research Centers, which are designed to lay the scientific groundwork for the next generation of energy technology.\nHere at the White House and across the administration, we're working around the clock to make America safer and more prosperous. But as the Democrats proved again last week, they're willing to put anything on the line, even national security, just to keep the President from putting his own team in place to carry out his agenda.\nLast week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued this unprecedented pattern of obstruction when he decided to politicize the number-two job at the Department of Defense at a time of rising national security threats. Rather than allow Patrick Shanahan, the President's nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense, to be voted on by unanimous consent as proposed by Senator McCain, Senator Schumer objected, further delaying his confirmation.\nMr. Shanahan is eminently qualified and was even praised by the New York Times as \"a good complement\" to Secretary Mattis, but his nomination has languished in the Senate for over a month as a casualty of these partisan attacks.\nThis is on top of an even more brazen example from earlier this month where Senate Democrats used every available tool to delay the confirmation of a judge that was eventually confirmed 100-0. They all supported the nomination, they all voted for him, so the Senate Democrats' delay tactics had nothing to do with questions about his qualifications, and everything to do about pettiness and politics.\nWhile that effort was partisan, last week's move to block a vote on a key national security post is downright dangerous. Just one in four of the President's 187 nominees to date have been confirmed, and we're nearing six months into the administration. It's time for Senate Democrats to drop this pointless and petty gamesmanship and start working with this administration on behalf of the American people.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nMargaret.\nQ: Sean, good to see you back here. Question for you. One on Iran. Will this administration certify Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal?\nMR. SPICER: The JCPOA authority was delegated to the State Department. And the Secretary of Defense -- excuse me, the Secretary of State will have an announcement very shortly on that deal.\nI think you all know that the President has made very clear that he thought this was a bad deal -- a bad deal for the United States. And I will wait until the State Department makes further action before going any further.\nQ: And secondly, your counterpart in Russia, Dmitry Peskov, who speaks for Vladimir Putin, said today that they expect their properties that were seized by the prior administration to be returned and without any stipulations or attachments to that. Was this discussed with the President? Does the President have a strong view? What is it that the President would like to see in return before handing these properties over?\nMR. SPICER: I know that Secretary Tillerson -- that falls under his purview. He has been having discussions, and I would refer you to the State Department for --\nQ: But this came from Vladimir Putin's office, not --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But in our country, right now, the Secretary of State is handling that portfolio, and so I would refer you to him on that.\nQ: But did the President bring this up at all in his conversations in Hamburg with Vladimir Putin?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I'd be glad to find out on that. I don't believe it did, but I'd be glad to find out.\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The President tweeted earlier today that most politicians would have gone into the meeting like the one Don Jr. attended in order to get info on an opponent. He said that's politics. His FBI Director nominee said that anyone who was approached by a hostile government for opposition research should contact the FBI rather than taking the meeting. Who's right? And what's the White House's position on whether or not it's okay to meet with a hostile government for opposition research?\nMR. SPICER: Look, you know I'm not going to get into the specifics of this. But I will say that it is quite often for people who are given information during the heat of a campaign to ask what that is. That's what simply he did. The President has made it clear through this tweet. And there was nothing, as far as we know, that would lead anyone to believe that there was anything except for a discussion about adoption and the Magnitsky Act.\nBut I would refer you back to counsel on that one.\nQ: Okay. And can I ask about counsel, about Marc Kasowitz? He was -- reportedly, he exchanged emails with a private citizen with a number of threats and a profanity-laced set of comments. Does the White House and the President still have confidence in Mr. Kasowitz to speak for the administration on this Russia matter?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, he does. And I know Mr. Kasowitz has issued an apology on that matter.\nZeke.\nQ: Sean, first a follow-up to his question there. The President's tweet this morning regarding the Russia investigation -- did Ty Cobb vet that? Can you talk a little bit about his role? Is his job here to manage the President's personal response to the Russia investigation?\nMR. SPICER: Mr. Cobb -- as you know within the counsel's office, there are various attorneys that have different portfolios. And while we have outside counsel, a lot of times the requests that we get from this room require us to go to counsel and say, can we answer this question? What can we say or can't we say? You do your best a lot of times to get us to make a case why this should be answered by the White House.\nAnd so we end up spending a lot of time talking to the counsel's office about what can and can't be referred to outside counsel, what still remains in our purview. And so it was the decision of the White House to bring someone on board that, like in a lot of other areas that we have counsels dedicated to that, that there was significant interest in the subject to do that.\nQ: So in the case of the President's tweet this morning, was that something that went through Mr. Cobb?\nMR. SPICER: I don't believe so.\nQ: And once more, a follow on Made in America. You mentioned the Sikorsky helicopter parked on the South Lawn -- that would be known as Marine One -- who paid for that to fly here from, I guess, probably Quantico? And also, is it appropriate military resources for a political event?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it would be at Bolling, is where I believe that's held. But I think we're very proud. The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America. And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that. And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do. So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I'm wondering whether you can tell us if Made in America Week will include the Trump organization or Ivanka Trump brands committing to stop manufacturing wares abroad.\nMR. SPICER: Say that -- I'm sorry? If the --\nQ: As part of Made in America Week, if the Trump Organization or Ivanka Trump's brands will make any kind of commitment to stop manufacturing gifts, clothes, and other wares abroad?\nMR. SPICER: So there's a couple things that are interesting about that question. First, I think what's really important is the President's agenda, regulatory relief, and tax relief are focused on trying to make sure that all companies can hire here, can expand here, can manufacture here. That's something that he wants for every company, and you've seen him talk about that extensively.\nWith respect to his own companies, obviously it's inappropriate to discuss how anything would affect their own companies. But I can tell you that, in some cases, there are certain supply chains or scalability that may not be available in this country. I'm not going to comment on specific products, but I will tell you that the overall-arching goal, of course, though, is to grow manufacturing -- to grow and invest here in the United States and to grow U.S. workers here. So that remains the overall objective.\nQ: Obviously, it might be a sacrifice, given certain questions about going rates and stuff, but wouldn't it be sort of a way to show leadership?\nMR. SPICER: Again, it's not appropriate for me to stand up here and comment about a business. I believe that's a little out of bounds. But again, I would go back to the President's broader goal which is to create investment here, to bring back the manufacturing base. And I think when you look at a lot of these indices that measure confidence -- both in terms of CEOs, manufacturers -- that they're all-time highs. And I think part of that is that there's a lot of confidence that the President's agenda is going to accomplish that.\nCharlie.\nQ: Just a question about the DHS decision to allow 15,000 new temporary worker visas. How does that not conflict with the President's Hire American message?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'll refer you to DHS on this. But I think one of the things that you're seeing through this is it's not just the number, it's a lot of the qualifications and a lot that goes through there to ensure that we hiring and bringing in the people.\nAs you know, the President has been supportive of the RAISE Act, by Senators Cotton and Perdue, which seeks to really look at more of a merit-based immigration system. And that's something that he continues to push for, and we'll continue to work with Senators Cotton and Perdue and others to help get that in a place that will focus more on merit-based and really provide the overall reform that he's been talking about for a long time.\nDave.\nQ: Sean, thanks. What's the White House reaction to the government of Iran announcing that they've sentenced the Chinese-American student from Princeton to 10 years for espionage? And also, could you fill us in on any new sanctions on Iran?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on any new sanctions. If there are some, at that point Treasury would be the one to make that announcement when that's appropriate.\nObviously, we're disappointed in that. And with respect to that individual, he is someone that we're keeping an eye on.\nYes.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. With regard -- I wanted to ask you about steel tariffs. The President told reporters on the plane last week that he was considering tariffs and quotas with regard to foreign steel. This being Made in America Week, can we expect an announcement? Has the President made up his mind on whether he's going to do tariffs, quotas, or both?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's comments on Air Force One speak for themselves. When he's ready to make an announcement on that, we'll share that with you. But that's something that the team is still discussing with him.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. Is the President resigned to the idea that it seems unlikely that the Senate will vote on any type of repeal-and-replace bill anytime in the immediate future?\nMR. SPICER: I know that Senator McConnell has made it clear that he would like Senator McCain back. We obviously wish him a speedy recovery. And as soon as Senator McConnell -- as soon as Senator McCain can travel back, and Senator McConnell feels it's appropriate, he'll schedule that vote. We feel very confident about where we are now, and we look forward to getting that bill on the President's desk and getting it signed.\nQ: On Made in America, I just wanted a real quick question. I realize you can't speak, as you said, specifically about the President Donald J. Trump organization's companies, but I just wanted to get a view from you on what critics are saying about whether the President is the right vessel for this message. After all, he has shirts made in China and Bangladesh and India. Other products made -- like Trump vodka made in the Netherlands. So give me a sense, if you could, about whether the President is the right vessel for the message that he's going to deliver later today before the press?\nMR. SPICER: I actually look at it in a very different way, which is the President has been a very successful businessman on a number of fronts and a number of areas and industries, and to understand firsthand what the tax burden and what the regulatory burden do to a business that wants to grow or expand here or hire here. So I think he actually is -- in a very unique way understands the challenges that our regulatory system and our tax system put on businesses that want to hire here, that want to grow here, that need scalability and capacity here in a way that maybe isn't because of some of our arcane trade laws, our regulations, or our tax laws. So I actually think that he's in a very unique way able to talk about the challenges that so many of these companies face as they choose to expand, and some of the tariffs and quotas that they face in other markets.\nI know that some of the stuff -- you look at a company like Caterpillar, who is out there, and you talk to them about some of the tariffs that they face going into other countries. When you're talking about an earthmover, a D11 or something else, when you're talking about a million-plus-dollar piece of equipment, a 20 percent tariff is $200,000. So if you're going into a country where our companies are disadvantaged by a huge tariff, that's immediately putting them at a disadvantage.\nAnd the President understands what that means to a company that wants to grow and expand throughout the globe and meet new markets, and go into other places.\nSo I think he understands it probably very, very uniquely.\nFred.\nQ: Okay, thanks, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: I'll get to you, Andrew. Don't worry.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. A couple of questions on the Voter Integrity Commission's meeting on Wednesday. I wanted to ask you, without full cooperation of all the states, would the commission consider buying some of the registration information sort of the way campaigns do? Or using maybe a private organization like Aristotle International?\nMR. SPICER: Most of this information is available. All that those companies are doing is buying it from the states. So I don't think there would be any reason to go to a private vendor. I think we should be able to do this utilizing official resources that exist within a state.\nAgain, I think there's been some miscommunication on what they're seeking. The commission has asked that each state provide that information that is public that they share. And because that varies from state to state, what they're willing to give out, the commission was illustrative in its letter in trying to describe what it was looking for. But I think we're going to move forward very well.\nTrey. Yes.\nQ: I'm sorry, I do have another. And that's -- there was hacking into voter registration rolls in Illinois and Arizona, and we found out recently South Carolina was reported. Is that going to be something the commission will look into at all?\nMR. SPICER: I think the commission has got a very broad mandate to make sure that there's the greatest degree of integrity in our voting system and confidence in it. So I don't want to get ahead of their agenda, but I think all areas like that are going to probably get brought up. But the first meeting is Wednesday. We'll see what comes of it.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two foreign policy questions for you. First, what steps is President Trump taking to ensure that the Israelis are comfortable with the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Syria?\nMR. SPICER: So obviously -- you're talking about Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments.\nQ: Correct.\nMR. SPICER: One, I would refer you to him to that. But there's a shared interest that we have with Israel, making sure that Iran does not gain a foothold, military base-wise, in southern Syria. So while we're going to continue those talks, obviously we want to have the productive ceasefire, but we also want to make sure that we're not -- one of our other objectives obviously remains to make sure that Iran does not gain a foothold in southern Syria. So we need to continue to have that discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about his concerns, but I think there is a shared goal there.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. With the healthcare bill in limbo, what's the administration's plan to move forward on tax reform? Can you do it without having moved on healthcare first?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, the Senate is still on track to vote, which is great, and the President will sign it as soon as it's possible. We're going to continue to plan. We've had well into the hundreds, if not close to a thousand listening sessions with different entities -- so the number of entities, not the number of meetings. So they'll continue that outreach, continue to hear with folks. There's been a very robust discussion with House and Senate leadership and the committees of relevant jurisdiction, and we're going to continue that.\nBut we're going to keep moving that along. I expect there will be some activity in August and then into September, but we're still on track to do that. And we hope to have the healthcare bill completely locked up as soon as Senator McConnell deems it appropriate.\nQ: Sean, a follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: Kristen\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There's concern among those who support the healthcare bill that this extension is going to give the opponents of the bill more traction. What specifically is President Trump going to do to try to get this bill over the finish line? What will the --\nMR. SPICER: He's been very active on the phone. He's going to continue to meet with senators. I think he'll have some senators over tonight. He's been very active over the weekend. The Vice President has been extremely engaged as well. We'll continue those discussions.\nSo I think we're going to do what we did the last time. The President is going to be engaged, he's going to get this done. And then -- you know, it's been said before, but there's no one better than Mitch McConnell when it comes to knowing how and when to make a bill successful in the Senate. So we have every confidence in the Majority Leader's ability to get this done, and the President will do whatever he has to to support those efforts.\nQ: And who's coming over tonight? Is it just --\nMR. SPICER: I don't have a list for you.\nQ: And one quickly on Russia. President Trump has referred to the Russia investigation as a \"hoax,\" \"a witch hunt.\" Given the meeting that Donald Trump, Jr. had, does he now acknowledge that the special counsel is a legitimate investigation?\nMR. SPICER: I think Mr. Sekulow answered that question very extensively this weekend.\nQ: What would you say?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think it's been asked and answered.\nQ: Sean, can you tell me how these products were selected from each of the 50 states? And do you know if most of the owners are Trump supporters?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. You're free to ask them. I think the pool will be out there. I think there's some folks, so feel free to talk to them. This was an engagement where we asked for suggestions from governors and members of Congress to give us a list, and then, working within the different offices here, an ultimate selection was made. But we sought input from the governors and the congressional delegation.\nAbby.\nQ: Sean, since Friday the President has tweeted four times about healthcare, but he's also tweeted six times about the U.S. Women's Open, which was held at a private property that was owned by his company. So the question is: Is it appropriate for him to essentially advertise his private business using his Twitter feed and use of time, when comparatively less time is being spent on healthcare, an issue that, as you know, is the most important issue to Americans right now?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I respectfully disagree with that in the sense that sending off a tweet takes, what, five, ten seconds? As I just mentioned to Kristen, he's been extremely engaged throughout the weekend, making phone calls, talking to folks, meeting with his team, getting updates. So to compare a tweet with a meeting or a phone call of substance is probably a little --\nQ: But he did spend a lot of his weekend at the U.S. Women's Open. He seemed to be very engaged in it. I mean, the tweets are, perhaps, a second long, but it seems to indicate what the President is spending his time on. So how do you assure the country that he actually is, in fact, engaged on healthcare when we know where he was over the weekend -- he's been tweeting about it?\nMR. SPICER: I would suggest to you -- one, I just told you he's been extremely engaged in talking to different senators. I know that some of them have mentioned they had extensive discussions with him. Number two, this is the same group -- we got a lot of that it will never get through the House. He continued to work hard. He continued to be engaged then, and it came out. We continue to do what we have to do, and we'll make it work.\nBut we're going to get this done. We'll move on. We'll do tax reform. We're going to do infrastructure. The President has a really robust agenda, and I think when you look at the amount of activity that he's been able to do and the results that he's getting, I think that speaks for itself.\nAndrew.\nQ: Can I ask you a Made in America question, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, sure.\nQ: Just a quick one. Ivanka Trump's -- the head of Ivanka Trump's business said that it is currently not possible to make her products here in the United States. So what is the White House's or this administration's policy remedy for companies like that who say there's just no way to do it? How do they make their products here in America?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, I can't answer that question in the sense that I'm not -- but I can tell you that it depends on the product, right? There are certain things that -- certain industries that we don't do as much anymore, and there's certain things that we do do more. There's a certain aspect of technology and labor. But as I mentioned before in terms of scalability, there's certain things that we may not have the capacity to do here in terms of having a plant or a factory that can do it.\nThe beautiful thing about a capitalistic society is that if there's enough of a demand for it, it will happen, and I think that's what the President is trying to do. If you lower the tax rate, if you lower the regulatory burden, you will hopefully grow businesses and grow manufacturing.\nI've talked to several CEOs and business leaders in the past couple of weeks about tax reform, and it's amazing how many of them tell you that they pay the 35 percent rate. And you say to them, what will you do if that rate drops? And the number-one thing they talk about is they're going to invest and build more in their company. And I think that's what we need to do.\nBut some lines, some industries, some products may not have the scalability or the demand here in this country. But like so many other things, if there's enough of a demand, then hopefully someone builds a factory and does it. But we've seen that in your own industry, where you saw the decline of newspapers, for example, and you've seen a lot more online content and online publications. That's the evolution, sometimes, of some industries. But I'm sure somewhere around the world that newspapers still get delivered every day in a much greater way than they do here.\nQ: But is it appropriate, if there is no -- in the case of Ivanka Trump's businesses -- handbags, shirts, purses, whatever -- if there is no capacity, is it appropriate to make those things overseas?\nMR. SPICER: Well, think about all of the things that we buy every day. Of course there's a market, because we depend in this country for so many goods and services, some of which are made in America, some of which aren't. Obviously, we want to create an environment in which more things are made here, more things are exported from here. And that's what the President's agenda sets out to do.\nI got to go to the birthday girl, Micaela. Oh, I'm sorry -- Sarah.\nQ: Oh, thanks. It's not my birthday but -- (laughter) --\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) I don't even want -- it's Micaela's birthday, she's not here. I saw Eamon and I thought CNBC. My apologies.\nQ: I'll take a second question. (Laughter.)\nQ: Back to the JCPOA, I know you don't want to get ahead of the announcement about the recertification, but the administration has been reviewing it for some time now, even though the President has already made definitive statements about what he thinks should be on the Iran deal. So did he make those statements without having sufficient information about the Iran deal? Or is the review ongoing because he's open to changing his position on the Iran deal, if new information came to light?\nMR. SPICER: I got to say -- I mean, I think the President, from throughout the campaign until now, has made very clear that he thinks it's a bad deal. And initially he recertified it because he had the luxury of having an entire team here, both from State, DOD, NSC, to review it. That time is up and state will make its announcement very shortly.\nBut I think he's been very consistent with the fact that he thought it was a bad deal.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions and a short follow-up. When the President took office, one of the things he ordered was a 90-day cybersecurity review. That deadline came and went. It's been several months. Can you update us on where that report is? Has it been completed? And if it hasn't been completed, why?\nMR. SPICER: I will get back to you on the report. He did sign an executive order on cyber, making sure that we have the resources necessary to protect our key critical infrastructure.\nQ: Last week there was a march online -- day of action on net neutrality -- organized and participated by many of the largest companies in America -- Amazon, Apple, Facebook -- a lot of the technology economy that's been driving the U.S. economy. Granted, the FCC is an independent agency, but does the President believe that network neutrality is an important thing and an open Internet is important to the American economy?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, as you noted, the FCC is an independent agency and I refer you to them with respect to --\nQ: I'm asking what the President believes.\nMR. SPICER: I have not addressed net neutrality specifically.\nQ: Can you get back to me?\nMR. SPICER: I will definitely. Caitlin.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The Ukraine government reportedly went into damage-control mode in an effort to make amends when President Trump won the election after working with DNC and administration officials to undermine his candidacy. Is this an issue that was discussed during President Poroshenko's visit to the White House in June? And has the President discussed it with him?\nMR. SPICER: Actually, that's an interesting question. I will have to get back to you. Obviously, there's been a lot more interest in recent days with respect to what the DNC did in coordination with the Ukrainian government to try to collude and achieve a goal of having someone removed, which ultimately did happen.\nSo I don't know whether that came up with the President. I'd be glad to look into the call. I know that that story and the DNC's collusion with the Ukrainian government has definitely gotten a lot more attention since that meeting, so I'm not sure that it was necessarily topical at the time. But now that there's been renewed interest in what the DNC did, I'm glad to look further.\nQ: Does what the DNC did have any impact on this administration's policy towards Ukraine?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I don't -- it wasn't something that was discussed at the time of the visit that I'm aware of. I'd be glad to follow up and find out whether that did come up. But again, my only point is that, at the time of the visit, I don't believe it was as topical as it is now.\nGeorge.\nQ: At a briefing last month, you said you didn't believe the President factored in, when he made a trip, what his popularity is in that country. Now we have a report of a transcript of a conversation between Prime Minister May and the President in which he asked her to \"fix\" his popularity so he gets a better reception. Do you have any reason to doubt the accuracy of that transcript, that that conversation took place? And do you still believe that he doesn't factor in his popularity?\nMR. SPICER: I believe that -- I'm not going to comment on rumored leaked conversations. I will say that he was pleased to accept Her Majesty's invitation and looks forward to visiting the United Kingdom.\nKen.\nQ: On North Korea -- South Korea has offered to hold talks with the North Koreans. What's the President's view of that? And are there certain conditions that the President would like to see met before those talks take place?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously those comments came out of the Republic of Korea and I would refer you back to them. That being said, I think the President has made clear in the past with respect that any type of conditions that would have to be met are clearly far away from where we are now.\nJeff.\nQ: Sean, has the White House been monitoring the demonstrations in Venezuela, and do you have any reaction to that?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, we obviously are concerned about that. We've been watching what's been going on. We congratulate the Venezuelan people for the huge turnout in the referendum yesterday and the unmistakable statement that they made and that they delivered to their government.\nWe condemn the violence inflicted by government thugs against innocent voters, and efforts by the government to erode democracy in Venezuela. We once again call for the constituent assembly of July 30th to be cancelled, and for free and fair elections to be scheduled.\nQ: Just one follow-up on Iran. A senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard said today that if the United States designated the group a terrorist organization and applied new sanctions, that it would be perilous for U.S. forces in the region. Do you have a reaction to that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think our forces will ever be -- what was the word?\nQ: In peril.\nMR. SPICER: No. I think our forces are the greatest fighting machine in the world, and we'll do everything we can to protect our country and to make sure that we extinguish any threats that we face.\nThank you, guys. Hope to have you get a good look at what's going on outside, and the pool will do a great job.\nThanks.\nEND 3:05 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 3:54 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Henry Davis, president and chief executive officer, Greater Omaha Packing Co.; Secretary of Agriculture George E. \"Sonny\" Perdue; and Sen. John S. McCain III.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126686", "text": "The President. Thank you, Mike. And you know, Mike, it is true that, as I walked through the halls, we saw so many great companies, but the gentleman who was in charge of Omaha Beef—they do beef—he hugged me; he wanted to kiss me so badly. [Laughter] Because he said, it—our business is a whole different business now because you got China approved; the other administrations couldn't even come close. And I told him, you know how long it took? One sentence. I said, President Xi, we'd love to sell beef back in China again. He said, you can do that. That was the end of that. Right? Sonny. The great Sonny Perdue. So we're very happy.\nBut we're here today to celebrate American manufacturing and to showcase the amazing products from all 50 States, made in the U.S.A. Remember in the old days they used to have \"Made in the USA\", \"Made in America\"? But made in the U.S.A. We're going to start doing that again. We're going to put that brand on our product because it means it's the best.\nIn just a few months and moments, I will say what we've done over a short period of time and what we're going to be doing over the next 6 months will be incredible. We've signed more bills—and I'm talking about through the Legislature—than any President ever. For a while, Harry Truman had us, and now I think we have everybody, Mike. I better say \"think,\" otherwise, they'll give me a Pinocchio—[laughter]—and I don't like those—I don't like Pinocchios. [Laughter]\nIn just a few moments, I'll be signing a Presidential proclamation to launch \"Made in America Week\" and to make today \"Made in America Day.\" We are thrilled to be joined today by so many incredible members of my Cabinet. Every member of my administration shares the same goal: to provide a level playing field for American workers and for American industry. And we are providing it much faster than other countries would like. So it's been really a pleasure.\nWe want to build, create, and grow more products in our country using American labor, American goods, and American grit. When we purchase products made in the U.S.A., the profits stay here, the revenue stays here, and the jobs—maybe most importantly of all—they stay right here in the U.S.A. [Applause] True.\nIn the audience today, we have skilled workers, we have business leaders whose American-made goods we are proudly displaying all over the White House and outside. I saw fire engines. I saw tractors from Caterpillar. I saw some incredible machinery. Make it right here. We thank you for being here. We're honored to showcase your creations. And I will say, they've really taken on, and some of you have built names that I know of for so long. And it's—congratulations. Right? You in particular. What a great job you've done. Thank you very much. And I saw you on television this morning. You were fantastic. I don't know what you're doing, exactly, but you could always have a second career. [Laughter] You did a great job. Thank you very much. American workers, farmers, and innovators are really the best in the world. We know that. And what we're doing [with; White House correction.] that is, we're displaying those talents. You construct and harvest the products that fill our homes, feed our families, and defend our Nation and enrich our lives. I want to make a pledge to each and every one of you: No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth, and it has been drained. It has been drained.\nYou're going to see a lot of things happening over the next 6 months, you know, statutorily and through a lot of different legal—through the legal process. It takes a while to get it set so that you're allowed to do it. You're not allowed to do it, but we've now mostly fulfilled all of that. And over the next short period of time, you're going to see things announced that you won't even believe for our country and for selling product in our country and making product in our country and things that are great for American jobs. You're going to be seeing that happening really quickly, because we are totally set up, and the hard part now is done. It is a long, horrible process, but we're going to also get rid of some of that process for the future. But we're going to stand up for our companies and, maybe most importantly, for our workers.\nFor decades, Washington has allowed other nations to wipe out millions of American jobs through unfair trade practices. Wait till you see what's up for you. You are going to be so happy. [Laughter] This painful exodus of American jobs—and I've been talking about it for years—was also marked by a period of sluggish growth, falling incomes, surging welfare, and shrinking participation in the workforce. Clearly, it's time for a new policy, one defined by two simple rules: We will buy American; and we will hire American. Right, Governor?\nMy administration is removing the burdens and regulations on your companies so that you can compete, thrive, and grow. How many of you have noticed this so far? Because it's a big, big difference, right? That's a big, big difference. The people are coming up to me; they can't even believe it. We took the farmers' land away. We took the homebuilders' land away. They have their land back now, and they're building homes, and they're farming their farms, and it's a beautiful thing to see. And they're so thankful.\nSo a lot of those regulations have been taken off; the rest are coming off. And by the way, we will have better protection than we've ever had, but we'll also have something where you don't have to wait 15 years for a permit and then when you go to the board, you lose. And that's a big portion of your life wiped out waiting for a permit. We're not going to let that happen.\nBut for our Nation to really prosper, we must lower the tax on business—one of the highest in the world—and we must repeal job-killing Obamacare. We have to do that. And I can tell you, we hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him. He's a crusty voice in Washington. [Laughter] Plus, we need his vote. [Laughter] And he'll be back. And he will be back sooner than somebody else would be back. He'll be back soon.\nBut we need that vote. And we need a number of votes because we do have to repeal Obamacare, and we will end up replacing it with something that is going to be outstanding, far, far better than failing Obamacare, where premiums have gone up, in some cases over 200 percent this year; where your—every single element of it is bad, and the insurance companies, by the way, are fleeing, so people have—some States, you have no insurance companies.\nAnd we have some Governors here, and we have Senators here, and we have Congressmen here and -women, and I will tell you, it's a very, very hard time they're having with the Obamacare situation. So we're going to get that done, and I think we're going to surprise a lot of people. But they're pushing very hard. The Republican Senators are great people, but they have a lot of different States. Some States need this, some States need that. But we're getting it together, and it's going to happen. Right, Mike?\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Yes, sir.\nThe President. I think. [Laughter] And when it does happen, that will be a big day in America, believe me. A big day in America.\nBut we must also fight the unfair trade practices that have gutted our industry, and that includes cracking down on the predatory online sales of foreign goods, which is absolutely killing our shoppers and our shopping centers. If you look at what's going on with shopping centers and stores and jobs in stores, it's been very, very tough for them. They've had a very hard time. Closing at numbers and records that have never been seen before. So we have to stop that, the online predatory practices.\nSince the beginning of the year, we have already created over 50,000 brandnew manufacturing jobs, and we're just getting started. We will lift our citizens from welfare to work. We will turn boarded-up communities into new outposts of American commerce. And we will once again rediscover our heritage as a manufacturing nation. We used to be a manufacturing nation. Not so much anymore. But I will tell you, you look at Michigan, you look at some States that have really moved—you know, in Pennsylvania, 2 weeks ago they opened the mine—the first mine that was opened in decades. Opened a mine.\nAnd you know all the people that were saying the mining jobs? Well, we picked up 45,000 mining jobs in a very short period of time. And everybody was saying, well, you won't get any mining jobs. Picked up 45,000 mining jobs, and the miners are very happy with Trump and with Pence. And we're very proud of that. But that's just the beginning. We have jobs coming from all over.\nRestoring American manufacturing will not only restore our wealth, it will restore our pride and pride in ourselves. It will revitalize our independence, and it will rebuild the bonds of kinship between our communities and our citizens, which has been lagging, wouldn't you say?\nFor most of our Nation's history, American—and we see this—American Presidents have understood that in order to protect our economy and our security, we must protect our industry. And much of that comes at the border. George Washington encouraged Americans to produce their own goods so that our young Nation could become truly independent.\nPresident James Garfield said, of our Nation's manufacturers, that, \"to them the country owes the splendor of the position it holds before the world\"—meaning, protect us. Theodore Roosevelt declared in his first message to Congress that \"reciprocity\"—my favorite word, reciprocity—because we have countries that charge us a hundred-percent tax on a product, and when that product is sold by them to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing. And people say, \"Oh, that's free trade.\" No, that's stupid trade. [Laughter] That's really stupid trade.\nIt's incredible. You'll actually have people who—\"No, we can't do that. That's free trade.\" It's just—that's so incredible, but what are you going to do? [Laughter] Oh, what happens in Washington. You just wouldn't believe the things.\nBut \"reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection.\" And William McKinley proclaimed that \"we ought to take care of our own Nation and her industries first.\" We have to look at our Nation first for a change. We've been looking the other way for a long, long time. And if you look at what's going on or the success of other nations—even in Europe—you look at some of those countries, one in particular, it's not fair to the United States.\nAnd that's why I'm here, and I believe it's one of the primary reasons you elected me and Mike. I mean, that's why we're here. And I think you're going to see a big, big—I don't \"think,\" I don't \"think\"—I know you're going to see one of the great differences, and you're already seeing it, but it's going to get more so and more so. And we're going to end up having a level playing field. I don't want to say any more than \"a level.\" But if the playing field were slanted like a little bit toward us, I'd accept that also. [Laughter] Okay?\nSo, once again, we will celebrate craftsmen, producers, innovators like the incredible men and women in this room today. We will protect our workers, promote our industry, and be proud of our history because we will put America first. America will be first again. We will make America great again. Remember that. And we'll meet in this same room in a year and in 2 years, and you'll see what happened.\nThank you for all being here, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you.\n[At this point, the President moved to the signing desk.]\nHere, everybody. Oh, great companies. So this is being signed in honor of Made in America Day and Made in America Week, and soon we're going to have Made in America decades. [Laughter] We're going to have a lot of tremendous success, and it's already just starting to kick in.\nYou see it with the job numbers. You see it with the stock market, which hit an alltime high every day for quite a while now. You see it with so many other things. And most importantly perhaps, you see it with the manufacturers. Their level of enthusiasm is greater now than at any time since they've been taking this type of poll, and I believe it's 28 years old. So people are enthused. Are you all enthused? [Laughter]\nAnd thank you all for being here.\n[The President signed the proclamation.]\nNow, who gets this now? Who should get this? Huh? Who is the greatest——\nParticipant. I'll take it.\nParticipant. My wife. My wife.\nThe President. Who has the most jobs—[inaudible]?\nParticipant. And the most jobs?\nParticipant. Who has the least?\nParticipant. Oh, behind you.\nThe President. Good. Isn't that nice? Wow. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-07-17", "title": "Remarks on Signing a Proclamation Designating Made in America Day and Made in America Week, 2017"}

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126678", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:34 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: The second door was already open. You guys must be ready for me.\nI apologize for the delays. Good afternoon. Today, the Trump administration continued to shine a spotlight on the people, products, and principles that have made this country great with an event hosted by Secretary Zinke, celebrating the American outdoor recreation industry.\nThe United States has a long tradition of preserving the all-American outdoor experience, dating back to the days of President Theodore Roosevelt. And we've developed a booming industry to support that tradition that employs 7.6 million across the country, building boats and RVs, or supplying campers, fishers, and hunters.\nThe importance of exploring, innovating, and building here at home has always been a central part of our country's heritage. And President Trump is proud that his administration is highlighting its continued significance to both our economy and our culture.\nYesterday, the United States Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, took the next step in renegotiating the outdated and unfair North American Free Trade Agreement by releasing the administration's negotiating objectives.\nPresident Trump promised the American people, during the campaign, that he would renegotiate NAFTA to get a better deal for our workers, or he would withdraw from the deal. These objectives are a framework for what the administration sees as a more fair NAFTA -- one that maintains the benefits for American farmers and ranchers who have obtained much-needed market access but provides relief for the manufacturing industry that has suffered particularly hard under the current agreement.\nThey include addressing the United States' persistent trade imbalances in North America and obtaining reciprocal market access; eliminating unfair subsidies, market-distorting practices by state-owned enterprises, and burdensome restrictions on intellectual property; updating provisions throughout the agreement to support U.S. manufacturing; expanding market access for U.S. agriculture; adding a digital economy chapter; incorporating and strengthening labor and environment-side agreements; calling for the establishment of appropriate mechanisms to combat currency manipulation; and strengthening trade remedies, including the ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws.\nPoliticians have been promising to fix NAFTA for years, but this is the first time that a modern United States free trade agreement has been renegotiated. USTR will be making an announcement soon on the first round of negotiations as we work towards a NAFTA that benefits all Americans -- our workers, farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service providers.\nThis morning, the Treasury and State Departments took strong action as part of the administration's broader strategy to keep America safe from the threat of Iran's destabilizing influence. The Departments designated several individuals and entities for contributing to that influence. These actions are separate and on top of the President's direction to work with our allies to explore options for addressing the serious flaws of the JCPOA.\nEven as we continue to work to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, we cannot look away while Iran threatens our country and our allies in ways beyond their nuclear threat. All of these elements will be part of the comprehensive integrated strategy that the Trump administration is developing to address the full spectrum of Iranian threats to our national interest.\nAnd, finally, yesterday Sean was asked about the administration's position on the concept of net neutrality, and he said we'd get back to you. The administration believes that rules of the road are important for everyone -- website providers, Internet service providers, and consumers alike.\nWith that said, the previous administration went about this the wrong way by imposing rules on ISPs through the FCC's Title II rulemaking power. We support the FCC chair's efforts to review and consider rolling back these rules, and believe that the best way to get fair rules for everyone is for Congress to take action and create regulatory and economic certainty.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. The President seemed fairly blindsided yesterday by the defections on the healthcare bill. As the White House pivots and moves over to tax reform later in the summer, what are you going to change at the White House to make sure that he has a pretty good sense of where the votes are on tax reform as that legislative train tries to move (inaudible)?\nMS. SANDERS: The same thing we've been doing, and that's continue to have ongoing, regular, consistent contact with members of Congress. Ideally, some Democrats will want to participate in the process moving forward on a number of issues, including tax reform. And maintaining that open line of communication, as the President often does, meeting here with members of both the House and Senate as well as having regular calls and also having members of his administration in touch daily with both leadership and members of both houses.\nQ: And as you know, the debt ceiling vote is coming up later this year. Is there any plan to have the President reach out and make a case personally? And if he does, what is that case to lawmakers up on Capitol Hill on the debt ceiling talk?\nMS. SANDERS: In terms of actual tactics, I think we'll make those decisions as we get closer to that point. Certainly, I would expect the administration to be engaged in that process throughout.\nBlake.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Let me ask you a couple of questions about healthcare. The President said a couple times in his remarks a little while ago that at this point he'll just let \"Obamacare fail.\" Why is it acceptable policy to let Obamacare fail?\nMS. SANDERS: I think in large part -- look, Democrats have refused to join in fixing the healthcare problems that have plagued our healthcare system, specifically in large part due to Obamacare and Obamacare's failures. And that sort of, I think, behavior is simply unacceptable, and hopefully with the collapse of the program that they put in place, they'll be more willing to come to the table and help clean up the mess.\nQ: I want to ask you -- another comment about the timing going forward. The President said, \"Something will happen and it will be good. It may not be as quick as we had hoped, but it is going to happen.\" He also started talking about 2018 and the need for more Republicans to get elected. So I guess in the short term, is it realistic for some sort of healthcare agreement to happen before the August recess, even, as the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill had been hoping for? Is this a much longer-term horizon now?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, as we've said many times before, we're less focused on the timetable and making sure we actually get it right and get it done. We're continuing to focus on repealing and replacing Obamacare with a system that actually works, and those priorities and principles haven't changed.\nQ: So is it possible that this is a post-recess -- maybe even a 2018 event?\nMS. SANDERS: Ideally I think it happens as soon as possible. But again, we've been clear about not saying \"by X date, by X date,\" but more about \"let's get better coverage, let's get a better plan and a better program.\" That's been our focus, not the timetable.\nJohn.\nQ: Sarah, three Republican senators -- Collins, Murkowski, and Capito -- have come out against this idea of repeal. Collins, not surprising, she voted against it in 2015. However, Murkowski and Capito both voted for repeal in 2015, and now they're saying they're against it. Is this thing dead before it even leaves the barn?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the thing that's dead here is Obamacare. I think we've seen that it's completely failed, and at this point Congress needs to do their job and they need to do it as quickly as they can, because every day that they don't, we go further into collapsing under Obamacare. And so I think that, at this point, inaction is not a workable solution, and so they need to come to the table and figure out how to reform the system and fix it.\nQ: So what do you say to these two senators, Murkowski and Capito, who voted for repeal in 2015 but now say they won't vote for it in 2017?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we say what the Vice President said today: Do your job. It's time for Congress to do their job and do it now.\nQ: Speaking to members of the House, Paul Ryan a short time ago said it's pretty difficult to explain to your constituents why you voted for something two years ago but aren't voting for it now. Is that the tact that this White House will take, as well?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's something that those senators will have to answer to their constituents. That's not something that the White House has to answer on behalf of those members.\nQ: Sarah, will the Trump administration take actions to move Obamacare towards collapse, like stopping CSR payments or other things that have been threatened before?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that the White House has to take any actions for Obamacare to collapse. I think you see the evidence every single day. You've got dozens and dozens of counties that have no options on the exchange; premiums continue to skyrocket. I don't think the White House needs to do anything for the failure to continue.\nQ: But what about the CSR payments to insurance companies?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have anything further than where we've been the last several months on that. Nothing new to update.\nQ: Can I ask one more question about --\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. Why stop now? We're on such a roll. Everybody is having a good time. (Laughter.)\nQ: The Afghan girls' robotic team is here competing down the street. Ivanka Trump went there and visited today and met the girls. How does the President find out about some of these individual cases that he's interceded on, like Aya Hijazi or the Afghan girls' team? And sort of what ends up moving him on these individual cases?\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, I can't speak to every single way that he finds out about information. Obviously, he has a large staff and an administration that pays close attention to a wide range of issues, and this is something that was flagged and something that he took a great deal of interest in, in making sure that the problem was solved. And it was, and we're excited that they're here.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two questions, if I may. First, who is responsible -- primarily responsible for what appears to be the failure of this healthcare legislation?\nMS. SANDERS: I would say Democrats. They're responsible --\nQ: Can you explain to me how --\nMS. SANDERS: Sure.\nQ: -- given that they're in the minority?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. They're responsible for passing Obamacare. They're responsible for creating the mess that we're in. They're responsible for being unwilling to work with Republicans in any capacity to help fix a system that they know is completely flawed and have publicly said so. I think that it's pretty clear, and I think the responsibility lies on their shoulders.\nQ: Great. So then just a quick follow-up. A bipartisan group of governors, including the Republicans John Kasich, Larry Hogan, Charlie Baker, Brian Sandoval, are calling for a seat at the table and a bipartisan process in healthcare reform. Is the President open to that specifically, sort of starting over with a bipartisan look at this, bringing governors to the table?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has met with a large number of governors, talked to them regularly. That certainly won't stop at this point of the process -- not just on healthcare, but on a wide variety of issues. In terms of bipartisan, I think the President laid out pretty clearly from the beginning of this process he was more than willing to sit down with Democrats. I think they've been the ones that have been completely unwilling to even come to the table to be part of the discussion.\nHopefully now that Obamacare continues to completely collapse, maybe they'll decide that they want a part of this process.\nSteve.\nQ: Sarah, what is the President's level of frustration with Republicans since they control both houses of Congress?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's frustrated. He spoke about this earlier today. Again, I think his primary frustration is that there is no progress in terms of over the last 24 hours of moving this further down the road and giving Americans the system that they deserve. But I think he laid out pretty clearly that there's a small number of people that he's probably frustrated with. But I think in large part, most of the frustration lies with the Democrats who created the mess but don't want to help fix the problem.\nQ: And when he says he's not going to own it, what does he mean by that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's not going to own the failure of Obamacare. I think exactly what I just said to Matthew. The failure of Obamacare I think rests solely on the shoulders of Democrats. They created the program. They pushed it through. They made this legislation happen, and they need to own the failure of it.\nJon.\nQ: Sarah, back during the transition, at the press conference the President had at Trump Tower, he was asked about healthcare. He said that there would be repeal and replace the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour. Did this turn out to be a lot more difficult than he anticipated?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly I think that after hearing members of Congress talk about repealing and replacing Obamacare for seven years, I think that most people thought that it would probably move a little bit faster.\nQ: What did he learn about the way Congress works in this process? What did he learn about this town? What did he learn about the legislative process?\nMS. SANDERS: Probably that government always moves slower than it should.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two statements from the President. One --\nMS. SANDERS: If you can speak up?\nQ: Sorry. Two statements from the President, one from him a year ago this Friday at the Republican National Convention as he accepted that party's nomination. He said, \"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.\"\nSo if the President knew the system so well, does he owe his supporters an apology?\nMS. SANDERS: For what? For --\nQ: That he couldn't get healthcare across the finish line?\nMS. SANDERS: For what? Having the stock market at an all-time high, creating jobs, putting ISIS on the run, getting rid of countless regulations that have made the business climate better? Should he apologize for that? Absolutely not. We should be very proud of the progress that we've made in the first six months and the continued progress that we're going to make over the next seven and a half years.\nQ: And second question, another statistic (inaudible) your response to Matt. This is from November 8th, 2013, from the President: \"Leadership, whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.\"\nSo why is the President trying to shunt responsibility over to Democrats? Doesn't he own any of the blame here?\nMS. SANDERS: The blame of a program that was created and forced through before he took office? No. But the process of reforming healthcare is certainly not over, and we're going to continue to focus on reforming the healthcare system and putting one in place that isn't a failure, like Obamacare.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. This seems like a multi-question day, so I've got two.\nMS. SANDERS: I thought they were all multi-question days. (Laughter.) I didn't know that there was an option that we could do it different from day to day.\nQ: We could also do it on camera, but just an idea.\nMS. SANDERS: I'll consider that one, too.\nQ: Is the failure of this Senate bill going to change the President's approach on this at all going forward? Will we see him take a more public role with rallies and speeches calling for healthcare legislation? And also, how much should we expect to see him meeting with senators about this?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, the President has laid out the priorities of what he wants to see in healthcare reform. And now it's Congress's job to legislate, and we're looking to them to work through some of that process. But we're going to continue to be incredibly engaged, specifically on providing technical assistance, as well as looking at all options for best repealing and replacing Obamacare.\nQ: And the second one. One thing I've been hearing a lot is this notion that it might have been smarter to pursue infrastructure first because that had more bipartisan appeal and more likelihood of passage. Do you think there's any regret about not going for another agenda item first?\nMS. SANDERS: No, not necessarily.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, a couple questions. One, is the President going to go to the NAACP convention next week in Baltimore?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, April. I'll have to check and get back to you.\nQ: Is he considering?\nMS. SANDERS: I honestly don't know. I haven't see the schedule for next week.\nQ: Okay. When it comes to ACA, you're blaming Democrats. But Democrats are saying there were 99 amendments by Republicans in ACA. What do you say to that?\nMS. SANDERS: This is still a Democrat piece of legislation. It was written -- it was forced through.\nQ: But 99 written amendments.\nMS. SANDERS: Ninety-nine amendments to how many hundreds of pages of legislation? It's outrageous to make this a bipartisan bill. I think everybody knows exactly who was part of that process, and it certainly wasn't Republicans.\nQ: And last question. Some congressional leaders -- particularly Democrats -- are very concerned about the trust factor when it comes to Jared Kushner and his security clearance, and also still remaining in the job. What does the President have to say about his son-in-law, right now, in the midst of this storm -- the fact that more information continues to come out after he gave his initial statements, and their concern about the trust factor when he has a critical piece of security clearance that deals with issues of trust? Is the President considering allowing him to stay or leave? And should he keep his security clearance?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know of any changes that would be made. The President has confidence in Jared, and I'm not aware of any changes at all.\nQ: Sarah, is it fair to say the President was blindsided last night? Can you walk us through a little when he found out, when his senior staff found out?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the process piece and the tick-tock and the back-and-forth. Again, as we've said a dozen times, our focus is on the repeal and the replace, not the process piece of it, but making sure that we get this done.\nQ: Also, Sarah, can you confirm the President did tell lawmakers again last night that they would look like dopes if they did not vote for repeal and replace?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'll have to check and get back to you.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I want to ask you about the President's pledge to get more Republicans elected in 2018. He said earlier today that he's going to be working very hard to make that happen. Does that go for two Republican incumbent senators, Jeff Flake and Dean Heller, who were not onboard for this healthcare plan?\nMS. SANDERS: Due to legal restrictions, I'm not going to get into any potential election questions.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions, please.\nMS. SANDERS: John Roberts is bored today. He's headed out. (Laughter.)\nQ: John, stick around.\nQ: If it were on camera, I might not.\nQ: Ooh --\nMS. SANDERS: Nice.\nQ: Two questions. Even before Senator McConnell's statement last night and Speaker Ryan's press conference, the concept on an outright repeal was cause du jour in the House of Representatives at least. There was this meeting of conservative lawmakers on Thursday who were adamant about it. Congressman Biggs has since introduced the bill for a direct repeal. Is there any possibility the administration would at least sit down and join the cause for a direct repeal before it pursued any new kind of legislation?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we're certainly open to having conversations on all fronts and the best way to move this process forward.\nDave.\nQ: All right, my second question --\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, sorry, number two.\nQ: One of the things -- it's been concluded that the meeting that Ms. Veselnitskaya had with Donald Trump, Jr. was about eventually lifting all of the Magnitsky sanctions, which targeted top officials in the Kremlin. Now, since January, Secretary Tillerson has said none of the sanctions will be lifted. Many of the Russian expatriates and opponents of the Kremlin regime had suggested that if the President could put this issue behind him by supporting further Magnitsky sanctions. Are there any plans to do that?\nMS. SANDERS: Specific sanctions, I can't speak to that today. But once we have an announcement, I'll certainly let you know.\nDave.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. The President has said many times in the past six months that we needed to get the healthcare legislation done first so we could go on to massive tax reform to help the economy. Can you now proceed with massive tax reform that will give the biggest bang to the economy without having done the Obamacare part of it?\nMS. SANDERS: We're going to continue pushing forward on tax reform and laying out that plan. I know this will surprise a lot of people, but we can walk and chew gum at the same time. We're not done with the healthcare battle. We're going to continue pushing forward on that and hopefully get that completed, and then transition fully to tax reform after that's over.\nKristen.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. You continue to say that this is the Democrats' fault. The reality is, they were willing to sit down at the table with you guys and negotiate and try to improve Obamacare.\nMS. SANDERS: I missed all of those phone calls --\nQ: But they said they weren't going to work with you guys on repeal and replace. So isn't it fair to say that you guys were dug in and wouldn't find common ground with them as well?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. We've been very clear from the beginning we're willing to sit down with Democrats and talk about how to reform the healthcare system. And until they recognize the fact, I think, that Obamacare has completely collapsed and failed, I think it will be hard for them to move forward in the process. I think that their unwillingness is pretty well documented.\nQ: In 2012, @RealDonaldTrump's Twitter account tweeted, \"Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda\" -- and I'm quoting -- \"are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility.\" Doesn't the President need to take some responsibility for this moment, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think we're taking responsibility in terms of pushing new legislation through, but not the failures of legislation that happened before the President got into office. I think you also have to take into account the outrageous obstruction that we've talked about pretty frequently up here, not just on healthcare but across the board in just allowing the President's administration to be fully staffed and be able to fully carry out the duties of the office.\nQ: And I understand what you're saying, but this moment is not about the legislation that was passed before the President took office. This moment is about the President and Republicans who campaigned on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare for seven years -- the President for the time he was on the campaign trail -- not living up to that promise to the American voters. Doesn't he need to take responsibility?\nMS. SANDERS: Like I said before, the debate and the battle over healthcare isn't over. We're continuing to push forward to repeal and replace Obamacare, and we're going to continue fighting for that every single day. So you're speaking as if this is over and done, and it certainly isn't.\nCharlie.\nQ: Just curious whether the President would be willing to sign a repeal-only legislation if that ended up on his desk.\nMS. SANDERS: You know, I don't have any announcement to make on specifics that hasn't hit his desk, but I think right now we're certainly open to considering all options to reform healthcare and make sure that Americans get the best care possible.\nAlex.\nQ: The President earlier today had a luncheon with servicemembers and said he wanted to hear ideas from them about the war in Afghanistan. Can you tell us any of the ideas that he heard? Also, he's clearly not happy about how long the U.S. has been in Afghanistan. Would he reject a plan from Mattis of keeping the U.S. there long term?\nMS. SANDERS: In terms of specifics that were discussed at the meeting, I'll see if I can get any of those ideas if that's something that those individuals want to share. But the President felt like it was important to talk directly to some of the servicemen that have been on the ground and hear some of their feedback and some of their thoughts about what's taking place there and some of the progress being made.\nQ: And (inaudible) Mattis came forward with a plan that kept the U.S. there long-term. Trump has been complaining -- President Trump has been complaining that the U.S. has been there for 17 years. Would he be supportive of a plan that kept the U.S. there longer?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is still reviewing what options he wants to take and what decisions he'll make, and we'll keep you guys posted when we have an announcement on that.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act was perhaps the biggest campaign promise that the President made when he was President. Does the President believe, does he fear, that failing to do so will impact the Republicans' ability to hold on to the House and the Senate in 2018? Is this something that he's conveyed to members of Congress in his conversations with them?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're going to get the job done. We're still focused on doing what we set out to do. But I would also argue that the President laid out a lot of priorities during the campaign: creating jobs, creating a better job environment; getting rid of burdensome regulations; putting ISIS on the run; securing the border; protecting our country; taking steps every single day to help improve the lives of the forgotten man. And I think he certainly delivered on a lot of those things, and we're going to continue to do that every single day that he's in office.\nQ: And then, Sarah, also, in terms of what the President said a little bit earlier and also what he tweeted earlier, he spoke about coming together. Does that indicate that the President is open to some sort of bipartisan solution to fixing what is wrong with the Affordable Care Act?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. The President said all along that his primary goal is to find a solution, and he's happy to work with Democrats to get that done.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You said that the administration would want Congress to finish work on healthcare and then it would move on to taxes. Previously, the White House had said that it wanted to see a draft plan for that tax reform before the August recess. Is that still the case? And do you still expect to get tax reform done this year, in light of what we learned about the healthcare bill yesterday?\nMS. SANDERS: We're still very focused on moving forward on tax reform. It's still a big priority for the administration. And that certainly has not changed.\nQ: In terms of getting it done before the end of the year?\nMS. SANDERS: We want to get the biggest tax reform as possible -- tax reform plan in place. And we'll, you know, keep you guys posted on the timeline and announcements for that happening.\nQ: One other topic, since it's multiple-question day. I wanted to ask about the legal fees. Is the President paying for his lawyers that are defending him in the Russia case or in the Russia allegations that are outside of this White House? And is the President paying Mark Corallo, the spokesman, for -- Marc Kasowitz and Jay Sekulow and the lawyers on his team?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure what the structure is for that.\nQ: Sarah, didn't the President, though, himself, as a candidate and as President, raise significant expectations about this legislation, saying it was going to be a beautiful plan, everyone was going to be covered? And did he ever really have a plan? And what does that say about his true knowledge regarding the healthcare system?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has shown he has extensive knowledge. He's laid out the priorities that are important for him to be included in the legislation. And once again, this is not a game-over situation. We're continuing to push forward every single day and work hard to make sure that the American people get the type of healthcare that they need and deserve.\nAlexis.\nQ: Can I just clarify: As long as the Affordable Care Act remains law and replacement legislation is in abeyance, is the President committing, through HHS, to support the subsidies, the executive sustenance that the law -- the existing law requires?\nMS. SANDERS: As has been the case since we got here, we'll continue to keep you posted as decisions and changes are made, or if they're not.\nQ: And can I follow up? You just said a few minutes ago, we are taking responsibility in terms of pushing new legislation through. That sentence seemed to conflict with what you were saying earlier. Can you clarify what you mean by \"we're taking responsibility\"? What happened last night is the President's responsibility -- that's what you're saying?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm saying that our goal is to continue to push to repeal and replace Obamacare. We're committed to doing that. That hasn't changed. Throughout the campaign, that was something we talked about and something we talk about every single day -- that we're here, we're focused on doing that, and we're going to continue pushing forward. That's it.\nAbby.\nQ: So, outside of the White House, a couple of weeks ago, Mitch McConnell said either Republicans will agree to change the status quo or the markets will continue to collapse and we'll have to sit down with Senator Schumer. So he was suggesting that sitting down with Democrats would be a consequence of Republicans failing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Is McConnell and the President -- are they on the same page about whether or not they really do want to work with Democrats on this? McConnell seemed to indicate that that was the plan B, not the plan A.\nMS. SANDERS: The President has said all along that he's happy and willing to work with Democrats on repealing and replacing Obamacare.\nQ: But do you guys believe that that's the way the process has actually unfolded in the Senate?\nMS. SANDERS: In terms of Democrats being unwilling to come to the table, yes.\nQ: In terms of whether the Senate Republican leaders have been open to Democrats participating in the process.\nMS. SANDERS: I think Democrats laid out very clearly from the very beginning of this process they were unwilling to come to the table and have that conversation.\nQ: Sarah, I want to ask you about the Iran deal. It's been reported that the President was reluctant to certify that Iran is in compliance. Can you give voice to that reluctance? Just how reluctant was he?\nMS. SANDERS: I think, as everybody in the room knows, the President has talked about this pretty extensively, and his opinions and his feelings on this deal have certainly not changed. He still very much thinks it's a really bad deal and that the Iranians have not been fully compliant. And we're going to continue through this process. And I refer you back to his statement to see where he lays that out pretty clearly.\nQ: One more question. To follow up on the lunch today, he sat with enlisted men and he heard from them what they think should happen. Was the President seeking a second opinion from what he's hearing from the commanders? I'm just curious why he wanted to hear from the enlisted men.\nMS. SANDERS: I wouldn't call it a second opinion. I think it's important for him to have that type of engagement. I know that's something that matters to him, not just on specific policy issues, but just to be able to have that type of open dialogue with the guys that have the boots on the ground. And he'll want to probably be able to continue to do that throughout, you know, his time in office.\nQ: Sarah, both you and the President have suggested that Obamacare is simply dead. In fact, though, there are millions of people who still depend on it. And the President has decisions to make -- as was noted earlier, the payments to insurance companies and subsidies. He can push this over the cliff. As Senator Schumer said a short time ago, he has the power to do that. It's not simply going to fail on its own. He has the power to do it.\nMS. SANDERS: I disagree with you. I think we're seeing it fail day after day after day as millions of people --\nQ: Well, if it's already failed, it can't fail day after day after day. You're saying it's dead. You're saying it's dead. It's not dead. There are still millions of people -- many of them, the forgotten men and women you like to talk about -- who still depend on it.\nAnd he has the power to kill it, dead. He has the power to push it over the cliff. Are you saying he's already made the decisions on subsidies and payments to insurance companies that would finally kill it?\nMS. SANDERS: No, that's not what I'm saying. Again, in terms of Obamacare being dead, it's an unsustainable program. When something is unsustainable and it can't be revived --\nQ: So you're saying it's dying, you're not saying it's dead. There are people who depend on it, millions of people, many of them your supporters, his supporters.\nMS. SANDERS: Right, and that's why --\nQ: How could it be dead?\nMS. SANDERS: That's why the process of repealing and replacing would need to make sure that those people continue coverage. And that's been a big focus and one of the priorities of this process throughout -- from the beginning.\nQ: Is he going to help push it over the cliff?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think this is already going over the cliff and doesn't need a push by the President.\nQ: Sarah, when you've spoken, you've spoken to the President earlier today -- said that this system will continue to collapse and we'll get to a point where Democrats have to come back to the table and join in trying to find a way to fix it. What specifically does the administration think would be that point where he would get a group conversation that has not happened yet?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's a question, frankly, you'd have to ask the Democrats.\nQ: No, no, no, it's your --\nMS. SANDERS: I think they're the only ones that know what's going to bring them to the table.\nQ: No, you're the ones who keep saying that there's going to arrive a point at which the system has failed to such a degree that suddenly there's a willingness to compromise. So, like, what are you envisioning?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I can't imagine that --\nQ: Failures of individual plans?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't imagine -- that as this program, as he laid out, goes deeper and deeper off the cliff, that --\nQ: You're either off the cliff or not off the cliff. (Laughter.) You don't go deeper and deeper off a cliff.\nQ: What is the point you're describing?\nMS. SANDERS: The point is Obamacare is simply unsustainable. We've said this a hundred times. It's not a program that can be revived.\nQ: But you're saying you're going to arrive at that point --\nMS. SANDERS: It's not a program that can be revived. It is essentially a dead program in terms of being able to provide the type of healthcare that Americans need and deserve.\nAnd our point is the priorities that the President has laid out, we have to have a plan in place that actually provides care -- not just coverage; that brings the cost down; lower deductibles; across-the-board reform. And at this point, hopefully Democrats will see how bad the system is and come to the table.\nQ: But what specifically is going to happen to bring them back to the table? You're saying it's unsustainable, it can't be supported. And the President is saying it's going to get to a point --\nMS. SANDERS: I would think that those things alone should wake up Democrats and make them want to come to the table. I would -- again, I'm not going to speak for the breaking point of Democrats, but I can't imagine that as we continue down this road, they don't come to the table to try to help save healthcare in this country.\nQ: Sarah, you spoke before of -- a question about Syria. You spoke before about progress made (inaudible) ISIS. And U.S.-backed forces have taken a couple more neighborhoods in western Raqqa recently. I was wondering, does the President have an opinion on who should control the city after ISIS is expelled?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had that conversation, but I would certainly refer you to members of the national security team, and they might be able to help lay that out more clearly.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 3:11 P.M.

Thank you for that very kind introduction and your great leadership here. And I offer all of you a warm -- very warm -- welcome to our Nation's Capital. Welcome to Washington, D.C.\nIt's an honor to be here with you today with so many great American success stories, cornerstones of American communities, large and small, the members of the National Retail Federation here at the 83rd annual Retail Advocates Summit. Great to see you all. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings this morning from a friend of mine, who's a businessman who knows just a little bit about retail, who's fighting every single day to unleash a new era of American opportunity and prosperity, I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nFrom the very first day of this administration, President Trump has been fighting to restore jobs and opportunity and prosperity all across this country.\nThis President has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year.\nIn fact, the President early in our administration ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new federal regulations on American businesses large and small. (Applause.)\nAnd with the support of our new Secretary of Labor, Secretary Alex Acosta, President Trump is striking the right balance in labor relations -- appointing two highly qualified experts to the National Labor Relations Board. And as we speak, our administration is rolling back the Joint-Employer Rule. (Applause.)\nAnd in case you didn't notice, the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States, and President Trump has already started to rebuild America. And we won't stop until we have the best roads, best bridges, best airports and best harbors, and the best future that we've ever had. Plans are underway at the administration for a historic infrastructure bill, and it's going to support a growing economy all across America.\nIn fact, this week is Made in America Week for our administration, and the President has been fighting for American job creators and manufacturers and American farmers every single day so that your businesses -- American businesses -- can sell more American goods than ever before.\nAnd I'm here to report to you since day one of this administration, President Trump has been fighting tirelessly to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nEvery day Obamacare survives is another day the American economy and American families struggle. We all remember the broken promises that made it possible for Obamacare to get passed. You remember them? They said if you like your doctor you could keep them -- not true. They said if you like your health insurance you could keep it -- not true. We were told that health insurance costs would go down. That one wasn't true either.\nOur administration has actually shown that the average premium on the individual market has more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect less than four years ago. And in some states, it's more than tripled.\nWhen Obamacare passed, we were promised that families would save up to $2,500 in premiums every year, but the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than a plan did in 2013.\nWhile premiums are soaring, choices are plummeting. Next year, nearly 40 percent of American counties, including nine entire states, will have only one choice of a health insurance provider -- meaning they'll have essentially no choice at all.\nAnd even worse, dozens of counties will have no health insurance providers whatsoever on the Obamacare exchange in 2018. Men and women, behind these statistics are real people facing a real crisis. Behind every number is a name, and behind every name is a story.\nI've heard them as I've traveled across this country on our President's behalf. I've heard firsthand from job creators just like all of you in this room and working families about the burden that Obamacare has placed upon them -- the burden of higher costs, fewer choices, and worse care for the most vulnerable.\nObamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nNow President Trump and I are grateful for the efforts of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the vast majority of Republicans who have worked so hard in the House and Senate to keep their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nAs the President said just earlier today, most Republicans were loyal terrific and worked really hard. And there are no truer words.\nBut last night we learned that the Senate still doesn't have consensus on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.\nPresident Trump and I fully support the Majority Leader's decision to move forward with a bill that just repeals Obamacare and gives Congress time, as the President said, to work on a new healthcare plan that will start with a clean slate.\nThe Senate actually passed the very same bill in 2015 and sent it to President Obama's desk, and they should do it again.\nBut to be clear: The Senate should vote to repeal now and replace later, or return to the legislation carefully crafted in the House and Senate. But either way, inaction is not an option. Congress needs to step up. Congress needs to do their job and Congress needs to do their job now. (Applause.)\nAs the President said, with his inexhaustible optimism and determination, stay tuned, we will return\nWe will rescue the American people from the disastrous consequences of Obamacare and restore a healthcare system based on personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform. That's the American way to meet the healthcare needs of the American people in the 21st century, and we're not going to stop fighting until we get it done. (Applause.)\nBut I'm here today on President Trump's behalf to say thank you -- thanks to the National Retail Federation and all the members for what you do for America every single day.\nIt's amazing to think for 106 years, the National Retail Federation has given a voice to the corner stores, the mom-n-pop shops, the grocers, the department stores, the Internet retailers, and all the other retailers that are literally the backbone of every American community.\nAnd the businesses represented in this room make a remarkable difference in the life of our nation and the lives of the American people every day.\nAs President Trump said when he met with retailers earlier this year, you're \"one of the great job producers\" in America, and it's true.\nRetailers are one of the largest employers in America today. In fact, a stunning one in four American jobs depend on the retail industry. The National Retail Federation's slogan really sums it up best: \"Retail Means Jobs.\" And the best days for American retailers are up ahead. I promise you that. (Applause.)\nNow, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all the retail champions who with us here today, especially Danny Reynolds, from Stephenson's, in Elkhart Indiana. Congratulations to the five finalists, one of whom will be the Champion of the Year announced later today. Let's give all the champions a round of applause. (Applause.)\nIt's important to celebrate the difference that each one of you make in businesses large and small all across this country. Beyond the numbers, beyond the jobs is something I would say is even more important, and that is growing up in a small town in southern Indiana, I know that retailers like all of you gathered here are simply a fixture in the lives of literally every American family.\nWe walk through your doors to get Christmas and birthday presents for our loved ones. We walk down your aisles and we browse your -- we browse those aisles to buy clothes and groceries and everyday necessities. We walk by your windows every single day. We pop in even if we didn't plan on it -- because it doesn't matter what we need, America's retailers have it.\nIn fact, one of the last things I did before I was sworn in as Vice President of the United States was stop by a retailer. It was during the transition here in our Nation's Capital, and Mrs. Pence had sent me a text and told me to pick up some ice cream. (Laughter.) It's the first time I'd done that with a large Secret Service detail. (Laughter.) But I did my job.\nLet me also say one more thing. Not only do you provide those great goods and great services to people all across this country, but on behalf of the President, I want to acknowledge the fact that America's retailers are really model corporate citizens.\nThe truth is you support every worthy cause in every community, large and small. You enrich not only our people, but our very way of life. You can't hardly go to a Little League baseball game, you can't hardly go to a local charity function without seeing your banners hanging, without hearing about your sponsorship on the brochure.\nKnow that your President and I are truly grateful for everything that you do for the communities that you serve. Why don't you give yourselves a round of applause for the difference you make in the lives of every American community? (Applause.)\nAnd I want to assure you, our President knows as retail goes, so goes America. The President told retailers earlier this year that out administration is in his words \"very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth,\" the growth that you'll need to continue to grow and succeed.\nIt's remarkable to think about everything the President has accomplished so far, it's only been six months. But President Trump is going to keep working every day to pass our agenda of less regulation, better infrastructure, more American energy, and affordable, high-quality health care. And rest assured, one more item I want to mention to you: This President is going to work with the Congress this year, and we're going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nThe truth is America's tax code is one of the biggest barriers to success for working families and job creators like all of you. I love that old line that says that the Internal Revenue Code is twice as long as the Bible with none of the good news. (Laughter.)\nWe're going to change all that. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We're going to simplify the tax code by cutting seven brackets down to three.\nWe'll eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We'll make the code flatter and fairer and simpler for everyone. And particularly important to retailers around America, particularly small-town, family retailers, under President Donald Trump, we're going to repeal death taxes once and for all. Death will no longer be a taxable event. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to your businesses, our tax plan is going to put American companies, including our retailers, back on a path to jobs and growth and better competitiveness.\nOur corporate tax rate -- it's remarkable to think -- is one of the highest in the developed world. Our outdated system of worldwide taxation literally penalizes companies for being headquartered in America.\nBut not for long. President Trump's plan is to slash the business tax rate to 15 percent. We'll enact a territorial tax that's in line with the rest of the world. We're going to cut taxes on the trillions of dollars that are locked away overseas so that American companies can invest those dollars in American workers, American jobs, and America's future. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump's tax-cut plan will empower your companies to compete on a level playing field with businesses anywhere in the world, and as we all know, when the field is level, American business always win.\nThe truth is President Trump's agenda is going to make the strongest economy in the world stronger still, and I believe that every business that's represented here will benefit from the historic accomplishments that lie ahead.\nBut as I leave, I want to challenge each one of you leaders in this country, leaders in the communities that you represent to stand with this President as he advocates an agenda built on American principles that will generate a boundless American future.\nI encourage you during this time in our Nation's Capital to let your voice be heard. As you reach out to our elected representatives, tell them you're counting on them supporting the President's agenda -- less regulation, lower taxes, better infrastructure. And while you're at it, tell them the time is now to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThe truth is President Trump is fighting every single day for all of you and all of the people that you serve in all of your various outlets. He knows that your success is America's success, and every community large and small is testament to this fact.\nWe have an opportunity. The President and I believe we have a responsibility to usher in a new era of jobs, of growth, of opportunity, and prosperity built on American principles -- timeless American principles of growth.\nAnd we have a duty to bring about the best and brightest future for all who are blessed to call our nation home.\nAnd this we know we will do because we have faith -- faith in the boundless capacity of the American people to revive this nation's economy and grow again.\nI have faith this President's vision for America and his determination to drive forward an agenda for this country that will renew and revive the prosperity of our land. And I have faith that He who has ever had His hand on this nation from its very beginning will yet bless America.\nAnd so I say with confidence, together with all of you and with Donald Trump in the White House: We will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again.\nThank you very much. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America.

These are people on the ground, know it probably better than anybody. A few of you know it pretty well, right?\nParticipant. Yes.\nThe President. And we're going to be getting some ideas because we've been there—it's our longest war—we've been there for many years. We've been there for now close to 17 years——\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. Close to it. Sixteen.\nThe President. ——and I want to find out why we've been there for 17 years, how it's going, and what we should do in terms of additional ideas. I've heard plenty of ideas from a lot of people, but I want to hear it from the people on the ground.\nSo this is actually a very important luncheon, and it's a great honor to have you with us. And I look forward to the discussion. We'll wait until the media leaves.\nI want to thank you, folks. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nHealth Care Reform Legislation/Tax Reform/Infrastructure/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization\nQ. Mr. President, Mr. President, are you angry at the Republicans who came out against your health care bill?\nThe President. Disappointed, very disappointed.\nQ. Is the health care bill dead, sir?\nThe President. I don't think it's dead, no. But it's—I'm certainly disappointed. For 7 years, I've been hearing \"repeal and replace\" from Congress, and I've been hearing it loud and strong. And then, when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don't take advantage of it. So that's disappointing.\nSo I'm very—I would say I'm disappointed in what took place. It will go on, and we'll win—we're going to win on taxes, we're going to win on infrastructure and lots of other things that we're doing. We've won and are winning the war, as you know, on the border. We are very much decimating ISIS. You can see that; you see that better than anybody sees it, the soldiers that are with us today.\nWe've had a lot of victories, but we haven't had a victory on health care. We're disappointed. I am very disappointed because, again, even as a civilian, for 7 years, I've been hearing about health care, and I've been hearing about repeal and replace. And Obamacare is a total disaster. Some States had over a 200-percent increase—a 200-percent increase—in their premiums, and their deductibles are through the roof. It's an absolute disaster. And I think you'll also agree that I've been saying for a long time: Let Obamacare fail and then everybody is going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a plan that's really good for the people with much lower premiums, much lower costs, and much better protection.\nI've been saying that—Mike, I think you'll agree—for a long time. Let Obamacare fail. It will be a lot easier. And I think we're probably in that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail. We're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it. I can tell you, the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail, and then the Democrats are going to come to us, and they're going to say: \"How do we fix it? How do we fix it?\" Or, \"how do we come up with a new plan?\"\nSo we'll see what happens. There's some other things going on right now as we speak, but I am disappointed because, for so many years, I've been hearing repeal and replace. I'm sitting in the Oval Office, right next door, pen in hand, waiting to sign something, and I'll be waiting. And eventually, we're going to get something done, and it's going to be very good.\nBut Obamacare is a big failure, and it has to be changed. We have to go to a plan that works. We have to go to a much less expensive plan in terms of premiums. And something will happen, and it will be very good. It may not be as quick as we had hoped, but it's going to happen. Okay?\nHealth Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Were these Republicans who came out against it disloyal?\nThe President. Well, they were not disloyal; they had their own reasons. I was very surprised when the two folks came out last night, because we thought they were in fairly good shape, but they did. And you know, everybody has their own reason.\nBut if you really think about it, you look at it, and we have 52 people—we had no Democrat support, which is really something that should be said. We should have had Democrats voted. This a great plan for a lot of people. We had no Democrat support. We have 52 people; we had four \"noes.\" Now, we might have had another one somewhere in there. But essentially, the vote would have been pretty close to—if you look at it—48 to 4. That's a pretty impressive vote by any standard. And yet you have a vote of 48 to 4, or something like that, and you need more—that's pretty tough.\nSo the way I look at it is, in '18, we're going to have to get some more people elected. We have to go out and we have to get more people elected that are Republican. And we have to probably pull in those people—those few people that voted against it. I don't know, they're going to have to explain to you why they did, and I'm sure they'll have very fine reasons. But we have to get more Republicans elected because we have to get it done.\nWe got it passed in the House. We would have gotten it very much—yes, you can't use his stand as a stand, right? [Laughter] We don't want that to happen. You're messing with the wrong guy here.\nSo we want—I think we're going to do very well, actually, in '18. I would be not surprised if something were done long before that. But in any event, because the margin is so small—the majority margin is so small—we're going to have to go out and get more Republicans elected in '18, and I'll be working very hard for that to happen, okay? And it would be nice to have Democrat support, but really, they're obstructionists. They have no ideas. They have no thought process. All they want to do is obstruct Government and obstruct, period. And in this case, think of it: so many good things. We didn't get one vote. And their plan has failed.\nAnd by the way, Obamacare isn't failing, it's failed. It's gone. So I think something is going to happen. We'll find out. Stay tuned. Thank you all very much.\nQ. Do you blame Mitch McConnell?\nThe President. No.", "timestamp": "2017-07-18", "title": "Remarks at a Luncheon With Servicemembers and an Exchange With Reporters"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126689", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to call the first meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to order.\nOur first order of business is to recognize each of our members and to make introductions and brief remarks. I'd like to start with a few comments of my own in addition to the remarks that I made from the podium.\nFirst and foremost, let me commend each one of you for stepping forward to serve your country in this capacity. As you heard from the President and from me earlier, we are truly grateful for your willingness to step forward. This is a bipartisan group that will perform a nonpartisan service to the American people. Our goal, as the executive order asserts, is to help promote free and honest federal elections. Our charge is to study the registration and voting processes used in federal elections. And, as I mentioned earlier, our charge is to explore vulnerabilities in the system that could lead to improper voting registration and improper voting.\nLet me reiterate the point I made earlier, now that we're on the record: We have no preconceived notions or preordained results. Our duty is to go where the facts lead and to provide the President and the American people with a report on our findings that can be used to strengthen the American people's confidence in our electoral system. And as you heard, the President looks forward to what we accomplish, and so do I. And I look very much forward to hearing from each and every one of you.\nThe President and I have a meeting scheduled soon after this with a number of senators, so my hope is that I'll be able to hear from each and every one of you before excusing myself to hear from members of the United States Senate on another matter. But I'm very, very grateful that you're here.\nWe'd like to ask that you limit your remarks -- your opening remarks -- to five minutes or less. There is a timer in the back, but I know we can go on the honor system here with each one of you, and we appreciate your sensitivity.\nI'd like to start by recognizing our distinguished Vice-Chair, the Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach. And Mr. Secretary, you are now recognized, with the gratitude of the President and this administration, for your opening remarks.\nMR. KOBACH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. It's indeed a great honor to serve as vice chairman of this commission. The charge of the commission is a significant one, as the President outlined: to study the threats to the integrity of our elections; to quantify those threats, if possible; and, if it's the will of the commission, to offer recommendations to the President to help ensure the integrity of future elections in this country. And most importantly, to share that information -- after the report is made to the President -- to share that information with the American public.\nThis is a mission of the highest order. I've often thought that at the very foundation of our republic are really two bedrock things: the American Constitution and the faith and reality that our elections are conducted fairly. If you take away either of those two things, I believe that our republic cannot stand for long.\nSo, for a long time, there's been lingering doubt among many Americans about the integrity and fairness of elections, and it's not a new issue at all. If you look at the polling data, it goes back decades. Public opinion has been consistent on this in that there is a substantial number of people who wonder if our elections are fair. A 2014 survey showed that only 40 percent of voters thought elections were fair to the voters, which indicates that 60 percent either did not think so or were undecided.\nWe owe it to the American people to take a hard, dispassionate look at the subject. And throughout our country's history, there have been specific historical episodes that we may have learned of in school or in college of voter fraud, and those may have received a great deal of attention. And individual states, from time to time, may have investigated specific allegations of voter fraud or have done some specific investigation of voter fraud.\nFor example, in my state of Kansas, we're engaged in litigation right now, defending our proof of citizenship requirements at the time of registration. And we've engaged in extensive fact-finding for the federal courts involved, and have discovered 128 specific cases of non-citizens who either registered to vote or attempted to register to vote. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. One expert in the case estimated that the total number could be in excess of 18,000 on our voter rolls.\nBut there's never been a nationwide effort to do some sort of analysis of this scope and scale -- to quantify and analyze the various forms of threats to our election's integrity. This commission will have the ability to find answers to questions that have never been fully answered before and to conduct research that has never been conducted before. And that research will not be buried. We respect the voter's privacy and will not identify individual voters with our voter roll data, but we will lay out factual findings and systematic problems that we can identify in our electoral systems. And those results, whatever they are, will be made public for the American people to draw their own conclusions from.\nIn 2013, President Obama established a Presidential Commission on Election Administration, and he did so, among other things, to analyze a problem that had been reported in several states in the 2012 election, and that was long lines at the polling places. When someone drives to a polling place and sees a long line two blocks long, there's a chance that that person may decide it's not worth it for me to vote, and turn around and drive home.\nSimilarly, if someone lives in a place where voter fraud has been known to occur in the past, and the elections in the past may have been stolen, there's a chance that he or she will decide that his vote is not likely to count or it will be counterbalanced by the fraud, and therefore decide not to vote in that case.\nThese are both problems worthy of investigation and worthy of a presidential commission. In Kansas, for the last 11 years, we've hosted the Interstate Crosscheck System, in which approximately 30 states participate. We annually compare our voter rolls to each other, and in so doing we find literally millions of people that are probable double registrations -- where the same person is registered in more than one state. With that information, the participating states can begin the process of keeping their voter rolls accurate and up to date. It's a starting point when the state can then call the voters in question, and, with the voters' consent, remove them from the voter rolls of the state in which he no longer resides, or else using a process laid out by the National Voter Registration Act.\nThe program also develops leads where it appears that the same person may have actually voted twice in the same election in two different jurisdictions. After further investigation, a prosecution for double-voting may be appropriate. This program, hosted by Kansas and in 30 states, illustrates how a successful multistate effort can be in enhancing the integrity of our elections and in keeping our voter rolls accurate.\nI'm confident that this commission will be equally successful on the national level. The talent, experience, and expertise of my fellow members of the commission is truly impressive. Thank you all for giving your time and your energy to this endeavor. I'm really looking forward to beginning our work together. Thank you\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for your opening remarks and thank you for your leadership on this commission. We look forward very much to working with you.\nWith that, I'd like to recognize my friend and fellow Hoosier, Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson, for five minutes.\nMS. LAWSON: Well thank you, Mr. Vice President, Vice-Chairman Kobach, and distinguished commission members and fellow citizens. It really and truly is an honor for me to join the commission today, and I want to thank President Trump for the chance to serve in this capacity.\nI am Connie Lawson. I'm the Indiana Secretary of State. I also serve as president of the bipartisan National Association of Secretaries of State, and in that role I co-chair the NASS Election Security Taskforce. I think my background is uniquely situated to the issue of voting processes and election administration. I served, on the local level, two terms as the Hendricks County clerk overseeing -- actually, after the 2000 election, it really and truly was the beginning of the move towards electronic voting and modernization of voting machines.\nI was very involved in the association, becoming president and legislative chair as well. Following my time in local office, I served 16 years as state senator. During that time -- the entire 16 years -- I was a member of the Senate Elections Committee. I did become the majority floor leader in the Indiana Senate, I think, as a result of my respect in that work. In 2012, a vacancy arose in the Secretary of State's office, and Governor Mitch Daniels appointed me to serve the remainder of the term. And I was elected to a full term in 2014.\nIt really and truly is an honor to be here with my distinguished fellow commissioners to discuss issues related to voting systems and processes around the country. With statewide elections in New Jersey and Virginia this year, and many more contests to follow in 2018, there is no better time to analyze how we can improve voter confidence in civic participation.\nWhile it's important to create an accurate understanding of the 2016 cycle, I believe that it's even more important for us to be discussing what lies ahead. This body has a great opportunity to outline constructive priorities as we begin our work. I would submit that one of the most important goals we have is improving the partnership between federal and state authorities where election issues are concerned. For instance, I and other secretaries have been frustrated by attempts to communicate with the federal Department of Homeland Security in their wake of their decision to designate election systems as critical infrastructure. The situation is improving, but it doesn't help when I'm still discovering facts about this decision through the media rather than from the decision-makers, and I'm hopeful that we can address this issue going forward.\nWhile I was state senator, significant updates were made to federal and state election law. Among those was the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, passed in 2002. It was passed to improve voting systems and voter access in response to the 2000 election. This legislation created the Election Assistance Commission and addressed provisional voting, voting equipment, statewide voter databases, among other things. A crucial point is that the HAVA standards were developed in a bipartisan, cooperative manner seeking input from multiple stakeholders in order to find points of agreement. It's my hope that this commission will operate in a similar manner as we get to work on behalf of the President, our states, and the American people. Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Appreciate your remarks very much. And now the chair recognizes the former Secretary of State for the great state of Ohio, Ken Blackwell.\nMR. BLACKWELL: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm honored to be a member of this commission. I want to thank you, Vice President Pence, for your leadership in this endeavor and express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for their willingness to undertake this important work. This commission and its task is to identify every threat to the integrity of the electoral process, both foreign and domestic. We are to serve the American people by enumerating the vulnerabilities of our electoral system and recommending countermeasures to protect the voting rights of the American people as guaranteed by the Constitution.\nI would like to offer, into the record, my work of constitutional law on this issue. I co-authored this work with Ken Klukowski, a respected constitutional attorney -- I'm going to say, from Indiana. (Laughter.) And our law review article is entitled, \"The Other Voting Right: Protecting Every Citizens Vote by Safeguarding the Integrity of the Ballot Box,\" published by the Yale Law and Policy Review.\nWe set forth that one way to articulate the right to vote secured by the Constitution is that every properly registered adult has the right to an undiluted vote. Each elector has the right to a vote that carries its full weight and that, when it is tallied, has its maximum proper effect to give that citizen a full voice in determining who among us will be entrusted with the powers of government for a term of office.\nAs we explain in our article, this really means the Constitution secures two voting rights. The first is the one we talk about most often -- the franchise, the right to cast a ballot on Election Day. Most voting laws combat abuses rooted in the past that denied Americans access to the voting booth. But there's a second right that accompanies the right to cast a ballot, and that is the right of the citizen -- a citizen's legal ballot not being diluted or canceled by anyone else's illegal activity.\nThat activity could be voter fraud by casting a ballot in more than one precinct or state. It could be a non-citizen voting, whether that non-citizen is a legal alien or an illegal alien -- if they are not citizens. Then their ballots dilute the votes of American citizens. The illegal activity could be voter intimidation or voter registration fraud, or it could be foreign interference in our elections, whether from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, or any other foreign power. This other voting right is a fundamental constitutional right against any such dilution or cancellation, and it is our commission's work and our mandate from the President of the United States to identity these threats and safeguard against them.\nAnother topic explored in our article is that voting is perhaps our only fundamental right secured by the Constitution that is also a citizen's duty. We all have the right to the free exercise of religion, or to keep and bear arms, for example, but our form of government does not impose them upon us as duties. But when it comes to voting, the Constitution enables election officials to presume that public-spirited citizens with due concern for the course of the state and national policy will be willing to satisfy reasonable regulations and shoulder incidental burdens in the fulfillment of their civic duty.\nMy home state of Ohio is the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Among the judges on that bench is Alice Batchelder. Two years ago, in Russell vs. Grimes, Judge Batchelder wrote, \"Citizens cannot demand as constitutional entitlement an environment in which fulfilling this civic duty is effortless. To the contrary,\" Judge Batchelder added, \"the Constitution allows for the possibility that citizens should be expected to overcome minimal obstacles when voting.\"\nEvery patriotic citizen who is a qualified elector has a solemn duty in our democratic republic to participate in public debate by casting their thoughtful, informed, and deliberate ballot on Election Day. We are a self-governing people. The machinery of democracy on Election Day is the cornerstone of how we govern ourselves. This commission's duty is to catalogue every threat to that machinery and determine how to thwart each threat and thereby safeguard the integrity of the ballot box.\nMr. Chairman, I ask that this article and my extended remarks be made part of the record today -- today's proceedings and the work of the commission. Thank you so much, sir.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Your law review article and your extended remarks are submitted to the record without objection. And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your opening remarks.\nWith that I'd like to recognize the Secretary of State of Maine, Secretary Matt Dunlap, for five minutes.\nMR. DUNLAP: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I apologize I don't have any prepared remarks, so I'll try to keep it within the 45-minute allotment. (Laughter.)\nOur experience in Maine has really been a truly gracious one, and we are very, very blessed to have the commitment of so many incredibly devoted and dedicated people across the state in the 503 towns and 425 unorganized territories of the state of Maine. An area from Fort Kent to Kittery, and from Oquossoc to Eastport -- the people that I work with in elections -- you know, I'm the chief elections officer of the state of Maine, but the actual election is run by those local town officials who put an extraordinary amount of effort to make sure that their neighbors can freely and fairly exercise their constitutional franchise of democratic self-governance. And we owe them a great deal -- and we have a great deal to be proud of.\nWe, too, get questions from time to time about something that happens in an election. We get a few hundred allegations of possible double-voting. But because our clerks work very closely with each other and we communicate with each other, typically what happens is someone requests an absentee ballot, and they forget about it or lose it in a pile of seed catalogues, and then they show up at the polls and we divine pretty quickly that, in fact, they only cast one ballot and then the question is answered.\nBut accountability is pretty important here, and I think that's the entire purpose of this commission is to help bolster and instill confidence in electoral process that belongs to the American people. And I hope that, in those considerations, one of the things we focus on is what works well. What do we do right? And certainly -- I listened very closely to the remarks of the President -- but no one who has spoken, including the President, has questioned the legitimacy of the outcome of the 2016 election. I think that's a great place to start from is, you know, what are the balance points between security and access?\nAnd I think that anything that we do to answer those questions, to reassure people that there are no goblins under the bed, and if there are, we deal with them in a way that is balanced, again, towards access of the voting public to participate in their government. This is not ours. It belongs to them.\nAnd I think as we move forward, the one thing I want to focus on -- and I tell our clerks this when we do our training every year -- is that this is a process that does not belong to us. It belongs to the voters. And everything we do, we must do with devotion to assure that the voters have their voice heard and that the ballots that are cast are done without question, and that the government that is installed to represent those people acts on their behalf with the confidence of the public. And I want to make sure that we answer those questions and that we move forward as a group with that same level of confidence, and I'll be very pleased to be a part of this. So, thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for those very thoughtful words, without notes and with great brevity. I like it. (Laughter.)\nWith that, it would be my privilege to recognize the longest-serving secretary of state in American history, New Hampshire's Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Secretary Gardner, you're recognized for five minutes.\nMR. GARDNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chairman. I look forward to the work we have ahead.\nAfter our federal Constitution was ratified, a person asked George Washington this question: What is the most important thing that a person can do for his country? And Washington answered that in five words: Express your view beyond yourself. When I first became aware of that, I took it to mean everyone's voice mattered. Be willing to share your views, have dialogue with others, and let others share their views with you, for it will strengthen our country. It can also be applied to voting, where we collectively express our views beyond ourselves by way of the ballot box. And the more often we get to do that, the more we fulfill the will of our first President. I would like more Americans to vote, not fewer.\nFor over a half-century, since the Civil Rights era of the '60s, our federal government and the states have been trying to find more and more ways to make it easier to vote. But when states try to balance that ease of voting with measures to increase voting integrity, it is often met with hostile resistance and charges of suppression.\nI will respect the facts that this commission receives, but it has been my belief over many years of administering elections that we will see an increase in voter turnout only when ease of voting is balanced with security and integrity. Making voting easier by itself does not result in higher turnout, as we have seen in our recent elections. Polls conducted just before the last presidential election found over half the country believes there's voter fraud. And polls after the election show a declining level of confidence in the balloting.\nDuring this century, there have been three national election commissions previous to this one. They spent time continuing the quest for ways to make voting easier. In my opinion, we need to first understand why turnout has not increased as a result.\nOne of the previous commissions recommended states adopt photo ID requirements for voting, and that commission was severely criticized for doing so. We also need to compare states that have voter ID laws with those without. I might add that the two highest states in turnout during the presidential primaries last year were both photo ID states.\nWhy is it important for the public to have confidence in their elections? The reason is contrary to common belief: One vote does matter. I have conducted nearly 500 recounts, all done by hand, counting paper ballots in a public process, including state-wide, congressional, and various smaller district races. Eleven of those recounts have ended in a tie; 32 were decided by one vote; and a total of 202, by less than 10 votes.\nAnd while serving as state representative, back in the 1970s, my state had a U.S. Senate race that was decided by two votes. The U.S. Senate, after that, tried to do a recount of that race and gave up after trying for five months. I am a witness that every vote matters, and there doesn't need to be massive voter fraud to sway the outcome. These are the experiences I will bring to this commission, and I will work with all of you endeavoring to let the facts we receive speak for themselves.\nThank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary. And thank you for those words and for your long service to the people of your state.\nThe chair now recognizes Judge Alan King of Jefferson County, Alabama for five minutes.\nMR. KING: Mr. Vice President and Secretary Kobach, it's a pleasure to serve on this committee. I appreciate the invitation. I'm Alan King. I'm the presiding probate judge in Jefferson County, Alabama. It's the largest county in the state of Alabama. We have roughly 660,000 residents, and in 2016 we had almost 460,000 registered voters.\nWe have two probate judges in Jefferson County, and I was elected in 2000 as the place two probate judge, and then in 2006 and '12 as the presiding probate judge. I have a law degree, and I'm a former president of the Alabama Probate Judges Association.\nIn Alabama, probate judges are the chief election official for his or her county. I've been involved in 10 major elections as the place two probate judge, and I've been the chief election official for 39 major elections as the presiding probate judge.\nOn August 15th of this year, we will have a special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by now Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nI have a certification, through the Election Center, which the premier -- or one of the premier election training organizations in the United States. And so I'm involved in elections, have been involved in elections for 16.5 years. I bring a wealth of experience from a county level. So to speak, I've had boots on the ground in every aspect of elections. I would consider myself to be an election expert on everything that involves elections.\nIn the national organizations that I'm a member of, it's been my great pleasure to meet other election officials on the national level. I have talked extensively with men and women for the last few years.\nI feel inclined, since I'm the chief election official for Jefferson County, Alabama, to say that, in my 16.5 years in the Jefferson County probate judge position, that I have not seen evidence of voter fraud in Jefferson County. I had one situation -- I think it was in 2014 -- where it was a father and a son had the same name. I became aware of that. I submitted this information to our district attorney, and the district attorney chose not to pursue any charges against either the father or the son.\nThe executive order that created this commission refers to voter confidence and voter processes. And again, since I'm a county official, I feel inclined to say that one of the most massive problems that will be facing this nation in the years to come is technology, and it's the technology of the voting machines. And I've seen it in the legal profession, from discovery and cases that have come before me in court. I'm in court virtually all day, every day.\nAnd bottom line: Technology is moving so fast that society is not able to keep up with the legal profession. My wife is an elementary school librarian -- now called a school media specialist. She's not able, educators are not able to keep up with technology. And I would venture to say, Mr. Vice President and Secretary Kobach, that we have a huge challenge in this nation with keeping with voting machine technology.\nAnd in 2002, the U.S. Congress and HAVA -- Help America Vote Act -- passed -- had funding that was filtered down to the states and to each county. And so from a county-wide standpoint, these voting machines are outdated. There's no money there. Counties don't have money. States don't have money. We need money. I was -- thankfully, four years ago, I got on top of this issue. I was able to convince my county commissioners to fund the next generation of voting machines in Jefferson County. We did that in the 2016 election to the tune of $3.1 million. But not every county can do that. Not every state can do that.\nAnd as we go down this process, it is my hope that we will -- that will be an issue that we will discuss. Because we can discuss a lot of things about voting, but unless we have the technology, unless the technology is keeping up with voting, then we're not using our time very wisely, in my opinion.\nSo I hope that that's an issue that we will get into. I hope that's an issue that we will discuss and discuss freely. And I hope that's a recommendation that this commission makes to Vice President Pence, to you, and to President Trump.\nAgain, thank you so very much for the opportunity to serve on this commission.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Judge King. Thank you for bringing your extraordinary experience at the county level, and those thoughtful opening remarks today. We look forward to working with you very much. An honor to have you here.\nWith that, the chair recognizes Commissioner Christy McCormick, who is also a member of the Election Assistance Commission, for five minutes.\nMS. MCCORMICK: Thank you. Mr. Vice President, Secretary Kobach, and my fellow distinguished commission members: I'm very much looking forward to participating in the mission of this commission.\nI started working in elections almost 30 years ago as an assistance voter registrar in East Haven, Connecticut. And since then, I've worked in several capacities in elections and voting, including eight years in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division's Voting Section, litigating and defending our federal voting statutes, including the Voting Rights Act, the NVRA, UOCAVA, and the MOVE Act.\nI was detailed to Baghdad for a year as the Department of Justice's expert in elections to work on the Iraq national elections. And I have since served, since January of 2015, as the commissioner on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which is dedicated to making election administration better across our country.\nI have worked directly with state and local election officials from every state and territory, and I see my role on this commission as representing a wide range of election officials. I have also regularly interfaced with voting system vendors and not-for-profit voting and elections organizations, and I will always take their concerns and interests into consideration.\nOur Constitution provides that our states have the authority and responsibility to run our elections, and I fully support this provision. However, I also believe that our federal government does have an interest in elections being free, fair, and secure from outside and improper influences. Our nation as a whole should be dedicated to ensure the survival of America's representative democracy.\nOver the past year and, quite frankly, much longer than that, we've heard that our election system is in danger. It is appropriate for us to examine any threats or dangers to our system, the integrity of our system, and the fairness of our system. We need to ensure that every American citizen who is eligible to vote may do so freely and privately, and that his or her vote is not diluted by improper votes or influence.\nWe need to ensure that persons who are eligible to vote are not disenfranchised, and that voters have confidence that our system is producing accurate, secure, and expeditious results.\nWith that in mind, I would like to see this commission, at a minimum, look at some of these questions: How we keep ineligible, and those operating in bad faith, off of and out of our voting systems. How we address the management of voter registration systems and the problem of inaccurate lists.\nI applaud the dedication and hard work of our election administrators across this country. And, believe me, they have a hard, hard and extensively complex job.\nBut I've also done election observation over the past dozen or so years, and I have yet to see a fully accurate voter list in any polling place across the country. I have seen firsthand irregularities take place in the polling place and in some offices. What causes a lack of voter participation and confidence in our system, and what actions should we consider that would hopefully boost participation and confidence in the voters' experience with our election system? What methods are currently used to identify, deter, and investigate improper registration and voting, and are those methods sufficient? And what are the methods currently used to identify, defer, and investigate voter intimidation or suppression, and are those methods working?\nThe entire world looks to the United States as a model for representative democracy and free and fair elections. As a nation, we must continually review and investigate any possible issues with our voting system, and we must stay vigilant to protect our precious right to elect our leaders.\nI look forward to working with the Vice President and with other members of this commission. I expect, as I believe the other members of this commission do also, full transparency, courteous discussion, and professional respect.\nI appreciate, in spite of some of the media reports I've seen, that the commission has no preconceived results, that we are not afraid of the facts leading us to the truth -- whatever that looks like, and that any conclusions or recommendations will be based on these truths.\nFinally, thank you to the President, Vice President for trusting me and allowing me to participate in this commission. It is an honor to serve my country. Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, Commissioner McCormick, thank you. Thank you for those good words. Thank you for bringing your vast experience in elections, at home and abroad, to this commission's work. We're grateful to have you here.\nThe chair now recognizes J. Christian Adams from Virginia for five minutes.\nMR. ADAMS: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you, Vice Chairman Kobach. I'd also like thank President Trump for initiating this long overdue effort. I would like to thank the other members of the commission for their willingness to examine the integrity of our electoral systems, and to seek the truth about vulnerabilities in these systems and contemplate ways to improve the process.\nMost Americans value truth and value election systems deserving of our faith. It has been said that truth enlightens our intelligence and helps shape our freedom. Clean elections protect our freedom. Elections tainted by fraud disrupt the consent of the government. I believe that all the commissioners are dedicated to an inquisitive and robust search for the data and for the truth about vulnerabilities in our elections, and ways to improve the systems.\nThere are areas of serious concern. For example, there are recurring indications that individuals are getting registered to vote even though they are marking the voter registration forms \"no\" to the question, \"Are you a United States citizen?\" Again, they are checking the box on the registration form that they are not American citizens, but are still getting registered to vote. What fair-minded American could support this? What serious, inquisitive American wouldn't ask, \"How does this happen? How often does this happen? How can we improve the system?\"\nYet, there are plenty of interests that would rather see these questions not be asked. The truth is more important but these individuals do not want the questions asked, and that is the wrong approach. Americans have never assumed that we could not accomplish the mission, could not improve the way things work. There are ways to examine and reach the truth about our elections without harming a single legitimate voter registration. I'm sure the members of the commission will do their best, as I will, to improve our election system.\nFor the first time, we have the tools, we have the will, and we have the support of the majority of the American people who are concerned with voter fraud to document these vulnerabilities in our systems and suggest improvements. And so I'm excited to help, and thank you for this effort.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. Adams. We're grateful to have you on the commission, and thank you for those opening remarks.\nThe chair now recognizes the clerk of Wood County, West Virginia, Mark Rhodes, for five minutes.\nMR. RHODES: Thank you, and thank you for permitting me to be on this commission. It is an honor. As county clerk, yes, I am in charge of the elections, and several of the things that I've even heard discussed here, I can say it's happened to me.\nI started working in our IT department in Wood County in 1997. I believe if you check my voting registration record for the year 2000, you'll find that I voted a provisional ballot. And the reason being was, I was deceased. We were doing a -- before we had a statewide voter system, we had to do a data upload monthly to the Secretary of State's office. It wasn't working properly. I'd marked myself deceased, ran a test, and never revived myself. (Laughter.)\nI walked into the precinct. I went over to Janice, who was our poll worker. She said, you're not in the book. I should be. I voted a provisional ballot because I was not in the book. I appeared at the county commission meeting during canvass, and they went, yep, you're alive, and my vote did count. So it's one of those -- there are things that do happen. And we try to make sure that every legally-cast ballot counts.\nIn 2014, when I ran for my first election as county clerk, I won by five votes out of over 24,000 votes that were cast. So it's one of those -- we need to have fair, clean, honest elections, and there should be no doubt that those five votes -- you know, my win is the win and it's there. There should be no speculation. I just want to make sure that we have good, fair, clean, honest elections. And thank you for permitting me to serve.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Clerk Rhodes. We're grateful to have you here bringing that experience. And I'm glad you're doing well. You look fine. (Laughter.)\nNow the chair recognizes David Dunn of Arkansas for five minutes.\nMR. DUNN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President, Secretary Kobach. I want to also thank President Trump for allowing me to serve. I'm humbled and I'm honored to have this opportunity to serve my country.\nHaving grown up in the Delta and to a political family, and spent most of my life as an economic developer in one of the most economically depressed areas in our country, I know how important the democratic process is. Anything that calls into question the integrity of this process undermines the entire democratic system.\nWe were asked today to present our thoughts on what we expected of this commission. I'm eager to learn -- and I have, today, a bit -- the priorities of my fellow commissioners, all of whom I have met for the first time today, and I look forward to -- with everyone how to tackle these complex issues.\nA vision for this commission is threefold. First, it is my desire for us to look at a myriad of issues to determine whether there are significant problems involving the election voter integrity. We should look at the way the states' elections systems are currently working, and what resources or support the have, and what might be needed to improve their accuracy and efficiency. Whether there's an increase in training of election and poll workers, improved communication between the states and localities across states, updated voting machines, or providing funds to assist localities in carrying out their voting election work, I hope this commission will look at all the possibilities to help states in their effort to run competent and true elections.\nSecond, I hope that this commission will ensure the privacy of America's voting public. I understand while the letter that was sent to the states asked for only publicly available voter information, it still raised concerns. And I believe that any data, statistics, or information collected by us or by the state should be held in our trust and safeguarded from any political misuse.\nAnd finally, I hope that the activity of this bipartisan commission are completely transparent and public. It's important that our work be conducted with the highest level of integrity, and that a variety of views can be expressed and considered.\nI applaud Vice President Pence for putting together this commission. I look forward, with each of you, to ensure that the voters in my great state of Arkansas and across the country know that they will not be unlawfully disenfranchised, and they can have confidence in the integrity of our election.\nThank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Commissioner Dunn. Thank you for those very thoughtful words and admonitions. We value them and identify greatly with what you said. Grateful to have you here.\nLastly, let me -- let the chair recognize Hans von Spakovsky for five minutes.\nMR. VON SPAKOVSKY: Mr. Vice President, fellow members of the commission: I want to thank President Trump for the honor of having appointed me to the Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\nI come at this issue of election integrity from very personal history. My German mother grew up in Nazi Germany as a child. My Russian father fought and escaped communism twice. They met in a displaced persons camp in Europe, after the end of World War II, before immigrating to the United States. My childhood was filled with stories of what it's like living in a dictatorship. And we were taught as children that the right to vote is a very precious right, it's one that can be easily lost, and that it was our duty to always vote and participate in the democratic process.\nI want to ensure that every American who is eligible is able to vote, and that his or her vote is not stolen or diluted because of administrative mistakes, errors by election officials, or intentional wrongdoing by those who are willing to take advantage of what we have, which is basically an honor system.\nI have almost three decades of experience in the field of voting and elections. That includes not only legal experience as a lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice, enforcing federal laws that protect the right to vote, but I've also been a local county election official in two states, Georgia and Virginia. So I know very well how hard election officials work to try to administer the voting process fairly.\nBut we do have problems that need to be fixed. We have vulnerabilities in the administrative system that we have, and we also have a history of voter fraud in this country. The Supreme Court itself said in 2008, when it upheld Indiana's voter ID law, the U.S. has a long history of voter fraud, and it could make the difference in a close election. And we have many close elections in this country.\nNow, one of the documents I want to hand out to everyone on the commission -- and this is a printout, and it's easily available on the Heritage website -- is a database that we started about two years ago of voter fraud cases from around the country. We are up to almost 1,100 proven cases of voter fraud, including almost 1,000 convictions of individuals in court. These cases run the gamut and show all ways that voter fraud is committed in this country. It includes impersonation fraud at the polls, false voter registrations, duplicate voting, fraudulent absentee ballots, vote buying, ineligible voting my felons and non-citizens, altering of vote counts, and ballot petition fraud.\nWe know we have problems with the accuracy of our voter registration lists. Numerous studies have been done about this that show -- including the Interstate Crosscheck Program -- that we have literally hundreds of thousands of voters who are registered in multiple states, and we have many people who are deceased remaining on the voter rolls.\nNo systematic, all-encompassing study has been done about these problems. But we know that more must be done to improve the accuracy of our voter registration system and the security of our voting process.\nNow, I have full confidence in this commission, which is a bipartisan commission, and I look forward to working with my colleagues. But I can't end my remarks without addressing what I consider to be the unfair, unjust, and unwarranted criticisms that have been leveled at this commission and some of its members. My father passed on to me the belief that one of the best things about America is the ability to have spirited but civil debates, even on contentious issues. Yet we seem to have lost that valuable part of our democratic process.\nMembers of this commission, including me, have already been subjected to vicious and defamatory personal attacks. Those who want to ensure the integrity of the election process are only interested in preserving our great democracy. The scurrilous charges that have been made are reprehensible and a tactic, frankly, to avoid a substantive debate on important issues and to prevent the research, inquiry, and study that is necessary to identify the problems in our election process, to determine what the solutions are, and to therefore ensure that we have the best election and best democratic system in the world.\nThank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Commissioner von Spakovsky. Thank you for bringing your practical experience and your background to this commission. We're truly grateful, and grateful for your stirring words.\nWell, let me say, listening to all of the commissioners on this panel, I am more confident than ever that this bipartisan group is going to perform an enormously valuable non-partisan service to the American people. I'm grateful for the words of admonition and challenge, one to another. I can attest and promise you that we do go into this process with no preconceived notions or preordained results. And the President has charged us to pursue the facts, and we will follow them with integrity, where they lead.\nThis will be a transparent and open process. But knowing the background of all these commissioners, I can also promise you a spirited but also civil debate. And we look very much forward to that.\nOur charge is simple. In the executive order establishing this commission, let me reiterate: It's to help to promote free and honest federal elections; to study registration voting processes used in federal elections; to identify vulnerabilities to the process that could lead to improper voter registration or even improper voting.\nWe will live up to that and we will challenge one another to achieve that. And I know -- I know in my heart that we'll do a great service to the American people.\nWith that, the chair would like to recess the meeting for a short lunch break. Vice-Chair Kobach will reconvene in approximately 20 minutes to preside over the rest of the meeting's agenda.\nBut on behalf of the President and myself, I offer you my heartfelt thanks for being willing to serve your country at such a time as this, in this important work.\nSo, thank you much. And we're going to recess.", "timestamp": "2017-07-19", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President Pence and Elected Officials at the First Meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128037", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning. Please be seated. On behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the inaugural meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\nJust over two months ago, on May the 11th, President Trump signed an executive order to create a commission to, in his words, help to \"promote fair and honest federal elections\" -- the foundation of our democracy.\nElection integrity matters to every American. President Calvin Coolidge reminded us, in his words, that the \"whole system of American government rests on the ballot box.\" And President Reagan declared that the \"right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties.\"\nBy establishing this commission, President Trump is taking action to ensure that the ballot box remains inviolate, and that the crown jewel shines brighter than ever before.\nAt the President's direction, I'll have the honor to serve as chairman of this commission. And it's a privilege to convene this first meeting today. President Trump knows that the integrity of our electoral system transcends party lines, and I'm grateful this commission has brought together a distinguished group of bipartisan election experts and public officials from federal, state, and the local level. And together, this bipartisan group will perform a truly non-partisan service to the American people.\nI'd especially like to recognize our vice-chairman, who you'll hear more from after the President's remarks, a man whose long service has established him as a national leader on election integrity, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. I also, as a point of personal privilege, would like to express my thanks and appreciation to Indian's Secretary of State, Connie Lawson, who joins us as a part of this panel.\nPresident Trump knows that the principle of \"one person, one vote\" is foundational to the American system of democracy. This commission has been charged to study the registration and voting processes used in federal elections. The commission will identify the laws, rules, policies, activities, strategies, and practices that will enhance the American people's confidence in the integrity of our electoral system. We'll also explore the vulnerabilities in our system that could lead to improper voter registration and even improper voting.\nThis commission, let me be clear -- this commission has no preconceived notions or preordained results. We're fact-finders. And in the days ahead, we will gather the relevant facts and data, and at the conclusion of our work, we will present the President with a report of our findings.\nI'm confident this commission will have a healthy and robust debate, but the President and I expect nothing less, because respectful debate is also a hallmark of our democracy. And I know that we'll find many areas of common ground, as well.\nI'm pleased to report that the commission has already started its work, requesting publicly available data, and we are grateful for the more than 30 states that have already indicated their intention to provide this information, pursuant to the laws of their states.\nToday is just the first of several meetings that the commission will hold in the coming months. Today we will hear from each of the commission's members. Each of you brings a unique perspective based on your experience and your research, and we welcome your participation and your insights.\nI'd like to note that our commission includes five current and former secretaries of state. And Secretary Kobach and I look forward to working with each one of you, as the chief election officers from across America, to foster a collaborative and respectful relationship for the benefit of your states' voters and our nation's electoral process.\nAnd finally, as the Commission on Election Integrity begins its work, I'd like to personally invite the American people to offer their public comments and input on our work, and the challenges and opportunities that face our electoral system.\nWe want to hear the voice of the American voter -- because that's really what this is all about. You know, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the integrity of America's elections and the right of each and every American to see the sanctity of their vote protected.\nThis President knows that the success of our democracy depends on the American people's confidence in this electoral system. And the President and I are both confident that this bipartisan commission will make the strongest democracy in the history of the world even stronger.\nAnd so with gratitude for his commitment to fair and honest elections, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.", "timestamp": "2017-07-19", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President Introducing President Trump at a Meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity"}

Mr. Vice President, distinguished guests, and members of the media: I'm honored to welcome you here today as the bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity prepares to conduct its first official meeting. Very, very important.\nThis Commission is tasked with the sacred duty of upholding the integrity of the ballot box and the principle of one citizen, one vote. Every time voter fraud occurs, it cancels out the vote of a lawful citizen and undermines democracy. Can't let that happen. Any form of illegal or fraudulent voting, whether by noncitizens or the deceased, and any form of voter suppression or intimidation must be stopped.\nI'm pleased that more than 30 States have already agreed to share the information with the Commission. And the other States, that information will be forthcoming. If any State does not want to share this information, one has to wonder what they're worried about. And I asked the Vice President, I asked the Commission, what are they worried about? There's something. There always is.\nThis issue is very important to me because, throughout the campaign and even after it, people would come up to me and express their concerns about voter inconsistencies and irregularities, which they saw, in some cases, having to do with very large numbers of people in certain States. All public officials have a profound responsibility to protect the integrity of the vote. We have no choice. We want to make America great again, we have to protect the integrity of the vote and our voters.\nThis is not a Democrat or a Republican issue, it's an American issue. It's about the concern of so many Americans that improper voting is taking place and canceling out the votes of lawful American citizens. That is why President Theodore Roosevelt once said, \"It is the affair of every honest voter, wherever born, to see that no fraudulent voting is allowed\" anywhere.\nI want to thank Vice President Pence for chairing the Commission. I also want to thank Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach for serving as Vice Chair. It's going to be a lot of work. They're going to work very hard over a fairly short period of time. And I want to thank you both very much—Kris, Mike.\nThis is a bipartisan panel consisting of both Republican and Democratic leaders and experts on voter integrity. I would like to personally thank each of our panel members for serving. Really do appreciate it.\nIn addition to the Chair and Vice Chair, this distinguished bipartisan panel includes: Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson—thank you; New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner—thank you; Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap—thank you; former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell; Election Assistance Commissioner Christy McCormick—thank you; former Arkansas State Representative David Dunn—thank you, David; Wood County, West Virginia, Clerk Mark Rhoades; Heritage Foundation Senior Legal Fellow and Manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative—a real expert—Hans von Spakovsky; President and General Counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation—great group—J. Christian Adams; and Jefferson County, Alabama, Probate judge, Alan King. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nEach of you has been entrusted with the great responsibility of helping to advance the cause of fair, honest, and lawful elections. Your work will help protect our democracy. This will be a very transparent process. It's going to be very open for everybody to see. You will approach this important task with a very open mind and with no conclusions already drawn. You will fairly and objectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.\nI look forward to the findings and recommendations your report will produce, and I share your report as soon as I can and as soon as possible with the American people so the full truth will be known and exposed, if necessary, in the light of day. We call on every State to give its full support and total cooperation in this effort. Most of them have really done brilliantly, and we appreciate it. And the rest, all of that information will be forthcoming.\nThank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. And, Kris, thank you. Panel, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Do a great job.

Okay, go ahead. Who's going to make the first presentation? I want to buy something. [Laughter] But only if it's made in America, right? Well, I want to thank you all.\nAnd Michael was a supporter of ours right from the beginning, which I really appreciate. It's good to see you here.\nMyPillow Founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Lindell. Absolutely.\nThe President. It's fantastic. And I actually bought a couple of pillows, and they're very good. I have to tell you, they're great. [Laughter] I've slept so much better ever since. [Laughter] So thank you very much, Michael.\nGood afternoon and welcome to the White House. We're here today to continue our celebration of American manufacturing as part of Made in America Week. The leaders and innovators around this table create the products that fill our homes, defend our Nation, and enrich our lives. And each one of these products proudly carries the label \"Made in the U.S.A.\" Do you remember in the old days? We used to say \"Made in the U.S.A.\" That was when we really had a great pride in our product. And you do, but unfortunately, we've lost a little something, but we're gaining it back very quickly.\nYou see the stock market hit a new high? Jobs are the lowest they've been—best jobs report we've had in, I think, 16 years. Unemployment numbers, fantastic, how we're doing. But we're also going to take care of the 95 million people out there that aren't working. And we have to remember that's not really part of the statistic. I've been talking about that for a long time.\nAnd when we got those great reports, I kept saying, you know, those numbers—whether it's 4.2, 4.3—I said, for a long time, they don't matter. But now I accept those numbers very proudly. I say they do matter. But we're doing very well with the jobs and the jobs reports, and we're doing very well with companies. We're really moving along.\nFrom day one, my administration has been fighting to bring back our manufacturing jobs and to crack down on foreign countries that cheat. Got a lot of them. We will end the theft of American prosperity, and we will stand up for our companies, our factories, and our workers. Is that okay with you, Michael? Good?\nMr. Lindell. Thank you. [Laughter] That's awesome, that's awesome.\nThe President. \"Made in America\" is more than a label or a product, and it's just something so important to us. It's a stamp of excellence. It's a badge of honor and a tribute to the tremendous skill of the working men and women who design and build these incredible masterpieces and different products of all types.\nWhen American workers have a level playing field, they cannot be beaten. They have not had a level playing field in a long time. But you see what's happening. It's step by step. We've gotten rid of regulations and a lot more are coming. We have some statutory requirements where we're not allowed to do it until certain dates. But they're coming as fast as those dates come. We've opened it up, and it's made a big difference for the farmer, for the homebuilder, for so many—and for the manufacturers.\nThat's why we want to ensure the integrity of the \"Made in America\" label. My administration is committed to working with the private sector to ensure the protection of \"Made in America\" and the label through efforts like certification, greater transparency, and stricter enforcement efforts by agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.\nWe will have zero tolerance for illegal counterfeiting, piracy, theft, or intellectual property. And they, really—they take our intellectual property like we're a bunch of babies—but no longer—and false claims that a product is made in America. And as time goes by, the value of \"Made in America\" is going to be greater and greater, so you're going to see more and more of this. There was a time when people didn't want to use that name and they wouldn't take that name. Now they're taking it, and that's because it's become—we've become very proud of it again.\nAround the world, the \"Made in America\" label is the gold standard for craftsmanship, quality, and artistry. And that is one more reason why we have to protect it. I mean, we have to protect it. Not for you, not for me, but for your children, for your grandchildren—because that's what's happening. So we must protect it from illegal theft and from abuse.\n\"Made in America\" movement is growing rapidly under my administration, and we're more determined than ever to protect our jobs, our industry, and our workers. Every day, we are putting America first. And as you know, during our campaign, I had a slogan—a few of you may have heard it—it's called \"Make America Great Again.\" Did you ever hear that slogan? I think so. [Laughter] Mike has. Right?\nAnd I want to thank our great Michael. Thank you for being here, by the way. And Secretary Acosta is here. And you have done a fantastic job in a very short period of time. And I know you are going to say a few words, so why don't you go ahead?\nThank you, Mr. Secretary.\nSecretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta. Mr. President, thank you. And thank you for your leadership. While we were waiting for you to walk in, we had short conversations. And I just wanted to tell you a few things that I heard from your guests here today. American workers are the best in the world. And American workers are passionate. \"Made in America\" matters, because when products are made in America, Americans care about what they're doing, they care about their products because they know the product impacts American lives.\nAnd so those are examples of what your guests here told me and, I think, examples of why \"Made in America\" is so important to this Nation, to the economy, and to this Nation's workers.\nAnd so thank you for your leadership on this issue.\nThe President. Thank you very much. So what label do you like better, \"Made in America\" or \"Made in the U.S.A.\"? Tell me. Think about it.\nMr. Lindell. U.S.A.\nChannelLock, Inc., President and Chief Operating Officer Jonathan DeArment. U.S.A.\nThe President. What do you like better, \"Made in America\" or \"Made in the U.S.A.\"?\nMr. Lindell. \"Made in U.S.A.\"\nParticipant. \"Made in U.S.A.\" The President. What do you like? Secretary, how do you feel?\nSecretary Acosta. I think \"Made in America\" is what we've been talking about. It's known throughout the world. And \"Made in America\" works.\nThe President. It used to be \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" I think, the label that was on a car. Do you know, they were telling me that in Czechoslovakia and other communist countries many years ago, they were so proud of a car if it was made in the United States. They used to take a single dollar, and they'd Scotch-tape it up their windshield just to show an American dollar. And that was a long time ago, but that's what they used to do. And maybe somebody is going to be doing that in the future.\nHow do you feel, Michael? \"Made in the U.S.A.\" or \"Made in America\"?\nMyPillow Founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Lindell. I feel \"Made in the U.S.A.\" But you know, the—I've done both. But my ads have all been \"Made in the U.S.A.\" But that's the way I feel. I just did a commercial with——\nThe President. How many pillows did you make last year in the U.S.A.?\nMr. Lindell. Ten million.\nThe President. No, it's—I mean, can you imagine?\nMr. Lindell. Last year. Thirty million so far.\nThe President. Thirty million since. That's fantastic. I know, it's amazing. I heard it's amazing.\nPeter, what do you like?\nWhite House Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro. I love \"Made in America\" because it fits in with our Buy American and Hire American, the two simple rules of the Trump administration.\nThe President. Okay. What does the media like? Do you like \"Made in America\" or \"Made in the U.S.A.\"? Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters], what do you like, \"Made in America\" or \"Made in the U.S.A.\"? Huh?\nMr. Holland. Either way.\nThe President. Either way. They're so quiet all of a sudden. [Laughter] Well, you make your decision. I think, specifically, \"Made in the U.S.A.\" was what they had—\"Made in the U.S.A.\" But either is great. Or both. I mean, you could really go both. Although, I think we'd probably like to settle.\nWhat do you like, Mike?\nRep. George J. \"Mike\" Kelly, Jr. I think \"Made in America.\" That's just what I've always thought. And to make America great again, you've got to make it in America. And I like that. And I like that. I like the way it goes.\nThe President. Okay, good. Very good. Are you going to show me some things? Let's go.", "timestamp": "2017-07-19", "title": "Remarks at a \"Made in America\" Roundtable Discussion"}

Before we get into the briefing today, I wanted to reiterate the President's statement from last night and say that the thoughts and prayers of the entire administration are with Senator John McCain, his wife Cindy, and their entire family.\nAs the President said, throughout his life, a distinguished career in public service, Senator McCain has always been a fighter, and we know that he will bring that unflappable spirit to his latest challenge.\nThis morning, the Office of Management and Budget released the first unified agenda update of the Trump administration, which shows that we are blowing away our initial one in and two out goal for regulatory reform.\nAnd with that, I'd like to bring out Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to talk more about the administration's war on waste, and how it's helping our economy grow.\nAlso, as a few of you may know, tomorrow is the Director's birthday. While I don't want to insult him by getting into too many specifics, I can tell you that the CBO estimates that this will be his 75th birthday. But actually -- (laughter) -- took a couple of you a little longer to pick up on that. But actually, it's just the last day he can answer questions as a man in his forties. So please do a favor and speak really loudly so you can make sure that he can hear you.\nAnd with that, Director Mulvaney.\nMR. MULVANEY: Thank you. That's absolutely lovely. Thank you.\nQ: Before you begin, Director, the visual aids, is it still off-camera given that you guys have this? I just had to ask.\nMS. SANDERS: Yes.\nMR. MULVANEY: Good. I'm glad we got that out of the way. Yes, happy birthday to me. This is a great way to spend my birthday. We actually started a Twitter account this morning for the sole purpose of getting into a Twitter war with my good friend, Congressman Gowdy, who tweeted out this morning that he thought I had turned 50 a long time ago. I tweeted back that he had two deep, dark secrets; one of which was that he's a lot older than I am -- which is true -- and also that he needs help counting to 50 -- which is also true.\nI'm going to talk a little bit about MAGAnomics, talk a little bit about what used to be called the unified agenda, which is a terrible name. And we'll talk about that in a second, and then take your questions.\nThirty-five years ago, the situation the country was in had some similarities to where we were as we ended the Obama administration. Things were kind of rough. I was in the homebuilding business. My dad was; I was only 13 at the time. And I remember what it was like. We had stagflation, we had malaise, we had all these challenges that the country faced economically.\nAnd in response to that, Ronald Reagan came out with Reaganomics -- a term, by the way, that I'm not even sure he created. I think his opposition used that as a derogatory term to begin with, but it came to be associated with his presidency.\nAnd I think if we look back on it, we know what its basic, fundamental tenets were. It was a monetary policy to fix inflation, tax cuts, spending restraints, and a little bit of regulatory relief.\nFast-forward to where we are today, here we are. It's been more than 10 years since our last year of a really healthy American economy, which we define as greater than 3 percent -- or 3 percent growth. And we think it's time for the next iteration of that, the next plan. And that is what we've put together as MAGAnomics. It's supposed to be this unifying theme of just about everything that we do.\nYou all have seen me up here before, when we walk through the budget. You say, \"Mulvaney, why are you doing this? Why are you doing that?\" And I talked about the importance of getting back to 3 percent growth.\nI talked about the historical importance of that, the historical achievability of that -- about how if you're 30 years old in this country, you've never had a job during your adult lifetime, in a healthy American economy, and you think that 1.9 or 2.1 or 2.5 percent growth is typical, and it doesn't have to be. It's not.\nI remember in the mid-1990s, when I had my first real job -- if I had been fired, it wouldn't have been that big a deal because I knew I could go find something else, because you could do that in a healthy economy. I actually ended up quitting my job so that I could start my own business, because you know you can do that in a healthy economy.\nIt's been a long time since we've been there. And our fear is that if we don't get back there quickly, there will be people who never know what 3 percent means. There will be people who have forgotten what 3 percent can be like. And I don't think it should come as a surprise that there are some people who don't want you to remember what 3 percent growth would be like, because it would be a tremendous sort of damnation of what happened in the previous administration.\nSo, what is MAGAnomics? It is tax reform. It is, what we're calling the \"regulatory accountability project\" -- regulatory accountability project. It's longer, but it's at least a little bit more descriptive than \"unified agenda.\" Took me about six months here to figure out what the unified agenda was. And they told me, and I said, what is it really? And they said, well, it's a way to bring to some accountability to regulations. I said, great, it's now the regulatory accountability project.\nEnergy dominance is part of this. Welfare reform is part of this. Infrastructure is part of this. Our trade policies is part of this. Even the spending restraint that we tried to introduce in the budget is part of this. All of those things are designed towards one common end, and that is 3 percent sustained economic growth in this country again. We've done it before. In fact, we've always done it. The last 10 years was the first time we have not been able to do it, I think, ever. We can do it again. We absolutely fully believe that.\nAnd I want to talk a little bit today about one piece of that, which is our deregulatory agenda. The regulatory accountability project -- used to be called the unified agenda -- released -- last night? Today?\nMR. CZWARTACKI: This morning.\nMR. MULVANEY: This morning. When the President came into office, he gave me some pretty specific instructions over the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs -- what we call OIRA -- O-I-R-A -- part of OMB. In fact, I still think OMB should be called OMBRA -- the Office of Management and Budget and Regulatory Affairs. That's how important it is to us. That's the priority that the President has set for it over at OMB. He said, look, get over there and tell everybody at all the agencies that we're on a two-for-one policy on new regs.\nYou cannot put out a new reg until you get two old regs off the books. That was our two-for-one policy. He also said -- and no new burden. No new financial burden. If you come out with a new reg that raises the burdens on the private sector by a dollar, you got to go find me a reg you get rid of to reduce that burden by a dollar. So, zero net impact on the regulatory financial burden in this country.\nThis is our first chance today to sort of get a temperature check on how we are doing on that. So the goal is two-for-one. When it comes to major actions -- we're at 16 to 1. Sixteen major deregulatory actions in the first six months of this administration. There's one new one. Is anybody going to guess what it is? Does somebody know? No dentists here? You know what it is? Yes. The dental amalgam rule. Apparently we're now regulating something to do with the stuff we put in our teeth when we get --\nQ: Mercury and waste water.\nMR. MULVANEY: There you go. All right? So that's the only significant new reg we put out in the first six months. We've gotten rid of 16. Twelve of those are CRAs you're probably familiar with, and four of them have gone through the agency process and so forth.\nBut it doesn't -- it's not just those big ones, okay? The number that I use -- 860 regulatory actions removed or withdrawn -- 860.\nBy the way, I asked for a list of them, and I got news for you: None of them are very sexy. None of them are very glamorous. None of them really rise to the level of getting national attention. But think about that -- 860 of them. I describe it as that -- sort of that slow accretion, that slow cancer that can come from regulatory burdens that we put on our people.\nRyan Zinke, over at the Department of Interior, has already made some changes on how they streamline the paperwork for outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen -- people who want to go out in our national parks. That's really small. We know that. It's not going to change the world. But when you do that 860 times in the first six months, it can have a benefit. Plus, if you're a citizen and you're not out there and it's now easier for you to use the national parks, to use our public lands, that's got to have a positive impact on you. We think that it does.\nBy the way, of the 860, and this is one that I think -- I don't think anybody knows about this because I didn't know about it until about 24 hours ago. The Obama administration had a secret list of regs. Back in 2011, they were doing their unified agenda. They had a bunch of things that they wanted to regulate. And what we're hearing is that they just didn't want to tell you about it. They thought it would be bad for their reelection prospects in 2012, so they created a secret list of regs that were not disclosed to you folks, and we are disclosing it.\nAnd by the way, when we threatened to disclose it, a lot of the agencies came up with those 860 things that we got rid of. So there will be no more of that, by the way. There will be none of that in this administration. We will not have a secret list. We will not have a hidden list of regulations that we're thinking about doing but we're not going to tell you about. That's going to end effective immediately. In fact, it has already ended. We're not going to do that anymore.\nBy the way, where's my stack? So I'd love a little graphics. This is the last week of the Obama administration -- the regs put out by the Obama administration in their last week in office. This is ours from our first week in office. I can't lift both of those together, can I? I don't think I can.\nIn the last six months here, the Obama administration put on over $6 billion in new regulatory burden. The last six months, just over $6 billion. We had zero. In the first five months in their administration back in 2009, they had over $3 billion of new regs. We cleared the decks of $22 million of regs. So we actually went the other way.\nSo I cannot express to you enough how much things have changed when it comes to the regulatory burden, the attitudes towards regulations in this country, and you're just going to see more of that for the next eight years.\nSo I think that's everything I wanted to cover. Is it? I forget. So if I got any questions -- yes, sir. Right there.\nQ: Thank you, Director. You talked about regulations in terms of the cost to business. Is there any other metric that you think is appropriate for measuring the effectiveness or necessity of regulations, such as whether they improve people's -- improve quality of life, improve safety in products, improve any sort of thing? Because it seems like all you talk about is how much this costs business. So is there any other metric that you look at?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, in fact, we're required by law to do exactly that. We're required by law to do cost-benefit analyses before we put on new regs or take off old regs. It's what we're supposed to do. Our attitude has been, and our philosophy has been that the previous administration fudged the numbers, that they either overstated the benefits to people or understated the costs. And we're going to look at it in a much more pragmatic perspective.\nQ: I mean, the reason I ask is because, you know, you just talked about the previous administration overstating the benefits. Are there benefits? I mean, talk about the regulations --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Were you healthy and safe before this came out? Yes, you were. And you'll be healthy and safe with this gone.\nQ: I don't know what's in those, Director. What I'm asking you is -- and you just said it; you talked about benefits to people. Is there any other measure? Because all you do is talk about the cost. And you talked about what your first week in office -- you know, what the benefit to the ones that you held up for you all's first week?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I think I answered that question. Yes, we are going through a cost-benefit analysis. We are obligated by law to do that and we continue to do that.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you tell us more about the secret list from the Obama administration? (Laughter.) What it was and what was in it?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I don't know. John, have we got details on that? You want to push that?\nMR. CZWARTACKI: They called it a \"pending list.\"\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: They called it the \"pending list\" or something like that -- previously undisclosed. We can get you a list of the examples that came off of it.\nQ: So it wasn't available anywhere? It was completely secret?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: 2011 -- I think they did a unified agenda in the spring of 2011?\nMR. CZWARTACKI: Yeah, in the fall, they did 2011. But the '12 spring agenda, they didn't do.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: They didn't do it.\nMR. CZWARTACKI: And instead, they put things they wanted to advance -- they kind of parked them on something they called the \"pending agenda\" and they kind of just went with that. And so when the fall full agenda came out, conveniently after the election, it was missing some things. So it was a trigger to a lot of academics who said, something's not right here, because there was this secret list being held back that was filled with all this.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Fast forward to when we started this process and we started asking the agencies to send us their ideas about de-reg. Listen, it's been a challenge. Start to think about the last time that the federal government has engaged in a full board deregulatory type of action and attitude. There's a lot of folks who work for the federal government who have never been asked to do this.\nIn fact, one of the anecdotes we've got is that -- I can't remember which agency it was -- but there was actually -- there was no box they could check on whether or not an action was deregulatory or regulatory. There was no column for deregulation. We're asking the federal government to use muscles it hasn't used in a long time, and it's hard to do.\nBut I will tell you this, when we first started looking at this a couple months back, and we noticed there wasn't -- we had done a pretty good job at all the agencies of slowing new stuff, but we hadn't done a very good job of clearing the decks of the old stuff -- the stuff that was already in the pipeline -- getting rid of it until we found this secret list and threatened to go ahead and expose it. And then they said, well, you know what, maybe we'll get rid of those. And that's how we ended up with our 860 here --\nQ: Can you assure us -- on one side of the ledger, then, you have secret lists from the Obama administration of potential new regulations. Can you assure us that there are no secret lists and will be no secret lists in this administration of regulations you want to do away with? Is all that public?\nMR. MULVANEY: Yes.\nQ: You have no secret lists anywhere?\nMR. MULVANEY: I like questions like that. That's an easy one.\nQ: When you went back up on the Hill -- last time you were on the Hill -- some of your critics had said that 3 percent --\nMR. MULVANEY: I have critics on the Hill? Really?\nQ: Yeah, can you believe it? (Laughter.) They were saying that you had -- that it's a pie-in-the-sky to believe that we can reach 3 percent. What is your response to those critics who say that you'll never reach 3 percent?\nMR. MULVANEY: It's outrageously pessimistic. You guys have heard my answer on that before.\nQ: Specifically.\nMR. MULVANEY: Specifically is this -- is that, yeah, you can get there again. They say, oh well, there's not enough people here anymore, all right. We're a graying population. There's almost 7 million people right now in between -- and I hate to get too technical -- U3 and U6. U3 is the general broad measure of unemployment. U6 are the folks who are working part-time or temporarily against the -- they want to work full-time but they can't find it. Almost 7 million people in that gap between U3 and U6 who could move into the full-time workforce tomorrow if they had the opportunity to do that. They want to do that, we just haven't given them the chance to do that. There's a big part of your workforce base -- move to productivity, okay. We also need productivity to be higher than it has been in the past couple years.\nLook at our tax plan. That's why the whole thing has worked together. That first answer, by the way, was welfare reform. How do you get people from U6 to U3? Economic opportunity plus welfare reform. Now we look at tax reform and its impact on productivity. We have to have the capital investment necessary to boost productivity, and we have to get that -- we can get that --through our tax reform. It's why we focus so heavily on corporate tax reform. We need those businesses to invest in capital in order to increase their employees' productivity because that's how we get to 3 percent GDP.\nQ: Just a quick follow up, though. Isn't -- just real quick. Your critics say that what that will do is help further destroy the tax base and the middle class. How do you address that?\nMR. MULVANEY: The tax base is -- I wish they had asked me that -- how is the tax base eroded by having people go back to work? That's absurd. So no, we are going to broaden the tax base by making sure there's more folks working.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Two part question. First, in terms of the 3 percent growth, can you give us your latest target for when you think that might be possible?\nAnd then as the second part of that, you talked about tax reform. Without overhauling Obamacare, if you don't get those tax cuts repealing the Obama-era tax cuts that you're looking toward, can you actually achieve comprehensive tax reform or do you then go to a series of tax cuts? What's your latest thinking in terms of what's --\nMR. MULVANEY: Okay, let me see if I can get this right. The first question is, what's our sort of schedule, our plan, or how do to get to --\nQ: When you can achieve 3 percent --\nMR. MULVANEY: I don't think we've adjusted the -- we put out the midseason report or the midyear report, something like that, a couple weeks ago. That's where you may have seen we changed sort of our -- we've measured actual receipts in the deficit and so forth. The deficit was a little bit higher than we expected. So we sort of go back in and say, well when we introduce our budget this is what we thought the world would look like. Here's what it looks like today. That would have been an opportunity for us to change our economic projections from the budget. We didn't do that. I think our projection for this year is still 2.3 percent and then 2.5 percent and then 2.7 percent or something like that. So the goal is to be at that 3 percent plateau in about three or four years.\nTo your second question about the Obamacare taxes and so forth, let me answer it this way and see if I've answered your question. Yeah, I think we're a little disappointed. The most recent proposed version of the Senate healthcare bill left some of those taxes in place, but I agree with many of my Republican colleagues on the Hill who say well, yeah, but you get another bite of that apple on tax reform. Is that your question?\nQ: Do you think you can do comprehensive tax reform if you don't repeal and replace Obamacare? Or do you then have to go to a series of tax cuts?\nMR. MULVANEY: I think it becomes easier to do comprehensive tax reform after healthcare for political reasons, for reasons of momentum and so forth, but I don't --\nQ: The math --\nMR. MULVANEY: Well, the math comes back to the issue of the deficit, so let's talk about that for a second. What is OMB's thoughts on this, right? You know that I've worked with Paul Ryan for many, many years. I believe that we should be willing to take on short-term increases on deficits if it's what it takes to get an increase in our long-term sustained growth.\nBy the way, that's one of the big fiscal hawks in town saying that. Okay? That I'm okay with larger deficits in the short run if the tradeoff is 3 percent growth, and if we need more aggressive tax reform in order to get to 3 percent, then I'm more than willing to argue that despite the fact that it may increase the deficit.\nBy the way, where did I learn this message about how important growth is in order to save the country long-term? Does anybody know? From Paul Ryan. So I can tell you, I think I've studied with some of the best, and I think I can make the case to him that while I appreciate and understand his position on deficit neutrality, when it comes to the tax reform, I think that growth needs to be paramount in that and that we're willing to take on short-term deficit increases.\nWe got one question here, and then I have to give it back to Sarah. Yes, sir.\nQ: Okay. Two-parter, one on the regulation and one on tax reform. On tax reform, there's a current-law baseline in the House budget that assumes that current tax cuts are going to expire, which means you'll have to pay for them. Is that going to make it hard -- will that make tax reform harder?\nMR. MULVANEY: I'm sorry, there are no -- the current tax cuts that are proposed? Because there are no current tax cuts. Are you talking about like when the Bush tax cuts were going to expire a couple of years ago?\nQ: Right.\nMR. MULVANEY: Those are all taken care of. I don't think -- if there are tax cuts on the books right now that expire in the future, I'm sorry, I'm not aware of those. Maybe I don't understand your question.\nQ: Fair enough. Let me ask you one about the regulation then. Bigger picture here, does this make it cheaper to run your regulatory agencies, and will you have a cut following '18 or '19?\nMR. MULVANEY: Well, you saw some of our proposals in our budget and our budget blueprint about some of the reductions we made, for example at the EPA. And yes we do foresee a fundamental difference in the way that agency functions, and we think they should be able to function in the future with a much smaller workforce. That's a reasonable conclusion from the proposals that we made in the budget, but I don't think it's fair to say we're doing this in order to make it cheaper to run the government. What we're doing is making it easier to run a country. That's what's driving the regulatory reform.\nListen, I'd love to do this again, but I promised Sarah the last 10 minutes. Thanks very much, and thank you for not making a big deal about the fact that I'm getting old.\nMS. SANDERS: We'll let you leave those there so you don't throw your back out carrying those out of here. Thank you, Director Mulvaney.\nAs the Director pointed out, today also marks six months since President Trump took office. On top of the historic results of our efforts to streamline regulation led by Director Mulvaney, the President has also made significant progress toward the rest of his top policy priorities.\nIn part due to the deregulation, our economy is booming again, and Americans are going back to work in construction sites, mines, and factories across the country. And those workers can rest easy knowing that they have a staunch defender in the White House, as the President shows time and again that he is putting America first in trade negotiations, pursuing reciprocal agreements with our trading partners so that everyone benefits.\nHe's prioritized the enforcement of immigration laws to protect all Americans and ensure that our system treats everyone fairly. He's opened up American energy after years of political opposition, putting us on track for energy dominance.\nSecretary Shulkin and his team at the VA are making sure our veterans get the care they deserve after the sacrifices they've made for our country by holding failing employees accountable.\nAnd in these first six months, President Trump has put America first in world affairs and national security, delivering historic speeches calling on our allies to come together in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism and calling out our enemies for the destructive behavior the previous administration neglected to address.\nAs you can see, President Trump has taken serious action on everything from energy to defense to immigration, even as he faces historic obstruction from Senate Democrats, who are pulling every trick in the book to prevent him from putting his team in place.\nThis week, we've seen even more evidence of Senate Democrats' pattern of holding up this administration's qualified nominees in unprecedented fashion. Here are some startling facts. To date, Senate Democrats have filibustered 34 of the 54 nominees that have eventually been confirmed. By contrast, in President Obama's entire term, his nominees faced four filibusters in total.\nThis President's Cabinet nominees faced more Senate filibusters than all other Presidents combined. And as we've mentioned they've filibustered nominees that enjoyed unanimous support, including a judge that President Obama had previously nominated, and who was eventually confirmed by a vote of 100-0.\nThey've filibustered key national security positions, like Patrick Shanahan to be the number two at the Department of Defense, who enjoyed bipartisan support and eventually received over 80 votes.\nAnd recent reports show that their refusal to hold votes on the President's nominees for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which approves potential new pipelines, is preventing an estimated $14 billion in pipeline projects. These are projects like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which will create 17,000 new jobs and $2.7 billion in economic activity in Virginia and North Carolina, just through construction, while generating $377 million in annual energy cost savings.\nThere are thousands more jobs like these that won't happen, and the Democratic senators of states like Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are standing by as party leadership puts politics over what's best for their constituents.\nTo be clear, they're slow-walking because they can't justify blocking these nominees who are both qualified and non-controversial, but this is part of a deliberate strategy to obstruct this President's agenda and resist the will of the American people.\nConsider this fact: At this pace, it would take an astounding 11 years to confirm all of this President's qualified nominees and finally have these important leadership positions fully staffed -- 11 years, clearly well after the President's two terms.\nWe call on Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats to stop this reckless partisanship, which is undermining national security, undermining our judiciary, undermining health care, job creation, energy production, and our basic functions of government, and swiftly approve this President's qualified nominees.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nQ: Sarah, thank you for the question. Does the President have confidence in his Attorney General? Does he want the Attorney General to stay in this post?\nMS. SANDERS: The President said -- as the President said yesterday, he was disappointed in the Attorney General Session's decision to recuse himself. But clearly he has confidence in him, or he would not be the Attorney General.\nQ: Sarah, can I follow up on that one? You said the President has confidence in the Attorney General. Does the President believe that the Attorney General serves the President or the Constitution?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe that the President -- I think that's kind of a both. Obviously, the Attorney General's job is to follow and uphold the Constitution. But also, every member of the Cabinet and the administration serves at the pleasure of the President.\nQ: Would the President prefer the Attorney General resign?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe I've answered that question.\nQ: It's a little bit of a slightly different nuance, so that's why I'm asking it. You say he has confidence in him. Does that mean he does not want him to resign?\nMS. SANDERS: I think you know this President well enough to know that if he wanted small business to take an action, he would make that quite clear.\nQ: But clearly there's a difference of opinion here because the President thinks what the Attorney General did was improper, yet the Attorney General, in recusing himself last spring, believes that he was taking the appropriate action, given the potential conflict of interest in him leading the Russia investigation. So how do you explain that split? And what --\nMS. SANDERS: As I said, the President is disappointed in the decision and I think he's spoken about his feelings on this quite clearly.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. A question about healthcare. The President has repeatedly said that 21-year-olds can pay $12 a year for health insurance under the Republican plan. He said it again yesterday to the New York Times. What does he mean by that? Is the White House aware of a health insurance plan that charges only $12 per year? And if not, why does the President keep making that claim?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll have to check on the specifics.\nQ: Can you get back to me on that --\nMS. SANDERS: Sure.\nQ: -- because the CBO estimates that it would be about $1,100 dollars a year, even for the lowest income 21-year-olds.\nMS. SANDERS: Okay, I'll check on that.\nQ: The President said that if Robert Mueller were to look at his finances or the family finances, it would constitute a red line. How is that not a threat to the special counsel?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the President -- the point he's trying to make is that the clear purpose of the Russia investigation is to review Russia's meddling in the election, and that that should be the focus of the investigation. Nothing beyond that.\nQ: That should not be viewed as a threat, as a warning to what the special counsel should or should not be looking at as it relates to the President's and his family's finances?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is making it clear that the special counsel should not move outside the scope of the investigation.\nQ: Let me try to come at this one different way.\nMS. SANDERS: I have a feeling we might do this for a little while.\nQ: Why does the President have confidence in his Attorney General? Maybe you can explain it that way.\nMS. SANDERS: I believe that the Attorney General has made significant progress in terms of things like MS13. They've taken great action on that front -- certainly on the front of immigration. He spoke today about some of the cybersecurity measures that they're taking, and I think those are great examples of successes that they've had at the Department of Justice.\nQ: It was reported last month that there was this rift between the President and the Attorney General and it ended up that the Attorney General had offered his resignation. Did that happen? How did that process play out? And why did the President at that time decide not to accept the resignation?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that taking place so I can't speak to that.\nQ: One more question. From his sickbed, Senator McCain today issued a statement that questioned why, six months into the administration, there still is not an Afghanistan strategy. He said they're still waiting. Why is there still not an Afghanistan strategy, and when can we expect it?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe that the President has empowered Secretary Mattis to make decisions on that front, and I would refer you to the Department of Defense for those specific questions.\nKristen.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. I want to go back to the President's comments about Robert Mueller. He was asked if Mr. Mueller does, in fact, look into his finances as part of his special counsel, would he consider firing him. The President said, I can't answer that question because I don't think it's going to happen.\nDoes that mean that firing the special counsel is something that's on the table for this President?\nMS. SANDERS: I've answered this question several times before. Although the President has the authority to do so, he doesn't intend to do so.\nQ: And, Sarah, if the President is not concerned about this probe, why does it matter? Why does he care if Robert Mueller looks into his finances?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's clear that the President is frustrated by the continued witch hunt of the Russia investigation, and he'd love for this to come to a full conclusion so that everyone can focus fully on the thing that he was elected to do. And that's what he'd like to be focused on.\nQ: And just one more about Senator John McCain. The President, like so many others, sent out letters of prayers last night to the Senator. Has he had any time to reflect on some of his past comments about Senator McCain? Does he regret saying he likes people who weren't captured?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about that. I do know that he certainly hopes that the Senator makes a full and speedy recovery. I don't have anything beyond that.\nQ: Sarah, it's been over a month since the President promised a press conference on discussing the administration's ISIS strategy. The Daily Beast had an article about this ISIS strategy document, and so can we expect this press conference to take place soon? And if the strategy is completed, then what's the delay about having this so far?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll certainly make sure that there's an announcement if there's a press conference and that you are all invited.\nRoberta.\nQ: Sarah, can you tell us a little bit more about the President's meeting today at the Pentagon? What was discussed? What was sort of the main focus there?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. Obviously, it's important for the President to have continued conversations and dialogue. The President met with members -- key members of his Cabinet and national security team, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, primarily to discuss challenges and opportunities.\nThey discussed how to integrate U.S. actions around the world to promote American prosperity, enhance American security, and extend American influence.\nQ: So was it a certain part of the world? Or all parts of the world?\nMS. SANDERS: It was a broad discussion.\nQ: Did North Korea come up?\nMS. SANDERS: I cannot get into the specifics of the detailed conversation.\nQ: Sarah, a finer point on Mueller: The President said if he does investigate his or the family's finances, that's crossing a red line. There's a report today that Mueller is investigating a broad range of the family's financial transactions. If that report is true, then he has crossed the red line. Does that mean he fires him?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, as I said earlier, the President has no intention to do so at this time.\nQ: Even if he crosses the red line? So the red line doesn't mean anything?\nMS. SANDERS: That's not what I said. I don't believe everything I read in the paper. We'll have to see as we get more details on that.\nQ: But he said that. It's on audio. He said, that's crossing a red line. That's not something you read in the paper. You can listen to the audio.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm talking about the investigation looking into the finances.\nQ: But if it's true --\nMS. SANDERS: The President has been clear many times before that he has no financial dealings whatsoever with Russia. The point the President is making is that the investigation should stay within the confines of meddling -- Russia meddling in the election and nothing beyond that.\nQ: And if it doesn't, he fires him.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into that.\nQ: Why does the President expect loyalty from his aides, from members of his Cabinet when he's constantly criticizing them and undercutting them and contradicting them in -- particularly in media outlets that he constantly tries to discredit?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't believe that the President is undermining them. I think he was being very candid about feelings that he had. But as I said, he has confidence in his ability.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, how does the process play out when the President is very candid about what he thinks about his Attorney General, about what he thinks about Mueller? How does this process play out?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry -- what?\nQ: The investigation -- the investigation, the whole process of relationships between Sessions and the President; the process of this investigation by Mueller. How does this play out with the President being very upset over the process and openly criticizing everyone and people in fear?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's pretty clear how the process will turn out from our side is that this will be proven to be the witch hunt that it is, and that nothing further will happen.\nTrey.\nQ: I have two more questions.\nMS. SANDERS: Two more?\nQ: Yes, two more. There's a belief that these conversations with the New York Times, with -- whatever reporters are pieces of intimidation to go to Mueller, to go to Sessions. What do you say to that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's ridiculous.\nThird question.\nQ: And then lastly, Baltimore. Does the President regret what he said about Baltimore? He threw Rosenstein under the bus for the wrong city. He's not from Baltimore, he's from Philadelphia. And there are people in Baltimore saying there are a lot of Republicans there even though the city is led by a Democratic mayor.\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's making a general statement.\nTrey.\nQ: But it was wrong. The statement was wrong.\nMS. SANDERS: He's spent a lot of time and has worked pretty extensively in Baltimore.\nQ: Has President Trump spoken with the Attorney General in the past 24 hours?\nMS. SANDERS: No, not that I'm aware of.\nQ: And a follow-up, does he regret appointing Jeff Sessions to be his Attorney General?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't believe so. I think if he did, then he probably wouldn't be in that position.\nQ: And a quick one on Afghanistan policy: Following his meeting this morning at the Pentagon, is the President any closer to unveiling a policy towards Afghanistan? And should the American people expect that we will be sending more troops to the region?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said earlier, the President has empowered Secretary Mattis in that front, and I would direct you to the Department of Defense.\nQ: Sarah, can we just reconcile what you just said? You said the President does not regret appointing Jeff Sessions, yet he said in that interview with the New York Times that he does regret it because had he known what he was going to do before he appointed him, he would have said, sorry, Jeff, I'm going to get someone else.\nMS. SANDERS: I think --\nQ: So I just wondering, how do you come to those two thoughts?\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry. I may have misunderstood what Trey was asking. My understanding --\nQ: He asked, does the President regret appointing Jeff Sessions --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry. I thought you'd asked if he regretted not taking action to remove Jeff Sessions.\nQ: So does he regret appointing Jeff Sessions?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has spoken very clearly on this in the interview yesterday. And as he said, he was disappointed that the Attorney General made the decision to recuse himself and certainly that he didn't tell him that before taking the job.\nQ: But he also said had he told him that he wouldn't have appointed him. So does he regret now in retrospect appointing Jeff Sessions?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't asked him specifically.\nQ: When asked about Mueller today a couple of times you've used conditional language that he doesn't intend to -- it's at this time. How can his independence be guaranteed if you're saying in conditional tense that he's not going to try to have him removed?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I can't predict everything that could possibly take place in the future and what Mueller could potentially do that might create an outrageous reason not to take action, so I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals. I can talk about where we are today, and that's the position of the President.\nQ: Sarah, you've been asked multiple times today about the war in Afghanistan. Both times you referred us to the Defense Department. But President Trump is still the Commander-in-Chief. Does he take full responsibility for whatever happens on the conflict in Afghanistan?\nMS. SANDERS: I would think so. But again, he has empowered Secretary Mattis in terms -- I've been asked specifically about troop levels and decisions on specific instances, and in that regard, I would refer you to the Department of Defense.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You spoke earlier about -- apparently about confidence in General Sessions staying there. Does the President have the same confidence and lack of regret in name Ron Brownstein [sic] deputy attorney general? Mr. Brownstein being --\nMS. SANDERS: Rosenstein, Rosenstein. I don't know who that guy is, but -- (laughter). So I'm not going to speak about him. But Rod Rosenstein, as I stated, if the President didn't have confidence, he wouldn't be in that position.\nGuys, I hate to cut us short today, but the President has -- hold on, I'm not finished. The President has an announcement that he'll be making here shortly --\nQ: Here at the podium?\nMS. SANDERS: No. (Laughter.) Here at the White House, and so I'm going to cut it short today. Thanks, guys.\nEND 3:06 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-07-20", "title": "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney"}

Price; Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive Officer, Merck and Co., Inc.; Ian C. Read, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Pfizer Inc.; and Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, Corning Inc.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126700", "text": "Well, thank you very much. Very exciting—and exciting times at the White House. A lot of things happening that are so great for our country. I want to welcome Made in America Week. This is what we call \"Made in America\"—right here, and they're all here. Some of the great business minds, businesses geniuses. Congratulations fellas. That's not a bad setup. [Laughter]\nBut they're right here with us, and I'll tell you, it's an honor to have them. We're continuing our celebration of American manufacturing and American manufacturing, and it's been something very important to us—made in the U.S.A., made in America—and our tribute to the skill, dedication, and grit of the American worker. We're showcasing products from all around the country that are stamped with the beautiful letters \"Made in the U.S.A.\"\nToday I'm proud to welcome three more great companies—we've had quite a few wonderful companies—a little bit smaller, generally speaking, than yours, but every company is smaller than yours when you get right down to it—to the White House for really a major announcement which you'll be hearing: Merck, Pfizer, and Corning.\nThese three companies are announcing that pharmaceutical glass packaging will now be made in America. That's a big step. That's a big statement. We're very proud of that. Thank you very much, by the way. And I know they wouldn't have done it under another administration, I feel confident.\nThese companies have formed a groundbreaking partnership to create thousands of American manufacturing jobs with this innovative new product. It's an incredible product. Merck, Pfizer, and Corning are coming together to create an advanced pharmaceutical glass packaging operations, which include an immediate investment of at least $500 million and the creation of nearly 1,000 new jobs—and quickly.\nThe initial investment will be spread across facilities in New York, New Jersey, and a new manufacturing plant in Southeast of the United States—they're looking right now—which Corning will be announcing in the coming months, and there's some pretty good competition. I know they're going to make a great deal.\nEventually, the companies here today expect a total investment in this initiative to reach at least $4 billion and create some 4,000 American jobs. And it's very innovative on top of it.\nThis initiative will bring a key industry to our shores that for too long has been dominated by foreign countries. We're moving more and more companies back into the United States, and they're doing more and more of these products. And that would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\nThese companies have achieved a breakthrough in pharmaceutical glass technology that will be used to store and deliver injectable drugs and vials and cartridges. This technology is not only great for American jobs and manufacturing, it's great for patients who now will have access to safer medicines and vaccines.\nIt's also great for the health care workers who can administer the drugs—makes it much, much safer for them—and safely without having any problems and worrying about vial-breaking, which, as I understand, is a tremendous problem that we're not going to have anymore.\nI know that Secretary Price and the FDA are committed to working with innovative companies like these. We have tremendous excitement going on at the FDA. Amazing things are happening there, and I think we're going to be announcing some of them over the next 2 months. We're going to be streamlining, as we have in other industry, regulations so that advancements can reach patients quickly. You're going to see a big streamlining; I think you already have. To a large extent, you already have. Very proud of that.\nI especially want to thank Ken Frazier, Ian Read, and Wendell Weeks—so three of the great, great leaders of business in this country—along with all of the great people at Merck, Pfizer, and Corning for believing in America and the American workers. This announcement reflects a central theme of my administration that when we invest in America, it's a win for our companies, our workers, and our Nation as a whole.\nEvery day, we are fighting to bring back our jobs, to restore our industry, and to put America first or, as you've heard, make America great again. That's exactly what we're doing. Some people have heard that expression. It's been fairly well used, I think.\nI want to thank you all for being here, and I want to thank you for your dedication to \"Made in America.\" Really appreciate it very much, and I'd like to have you say a few words. Come on up. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-07-20", "title": "Remarks Announcing a Pharmaceutical Industry Manufacturing Initiative"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126751", "text": "VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: On behalf of the President, welcome to the White House.\nI'm truly honored to be able to welcome organizations that literally represent millions of Americans and millions of businesses back here to the White House at such a critical time in our efforts to rescue the American people from the disastrous policies of Obamacare.\nI'm grateful to be joined by groups ranging from the Chamber of Commerce and NFIB, to Concerned Women for America, the National Taxpayers Union, American Conservative Union, Club for Growth and the like. But thank you to each and every one of you for the way your organizations have stepped forward to make the case to the American people that we can repeal and replace Obamacare with policies that are built on freedom, that are built on state-based reform, and that will give the American people access to the world-class healthcare that they need and deserve.\nAs we gather today, we are just a few days away from a critical vote in the Congress, a vote to begin the debate on the repeal and replace of Obamacare. And President Trump and I are urging every member of the United States Senate to vote to begin this debate.\nEvery one of the groups that are gathered here today -- the millions that you represent -- are here to speak with one voice to say to the Congress: It's time to vote. It's time to act. It's time to get on with a debate to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nAs President Trump said when members of the Senate gathered here at the White House just a few short days ago, inaction is not an option. And frankly, as the President said, any senator who doesn't vote to begin the debate is essentially telling the American people that they're fine with Obamacare.\nAnd that's just not acceptable because we all know the truth. Obamacare is collapsing all across the country as we speak. It's putting a burden on working families and American taxpayers and job creators all across this nation.\nWe all remember the broken promises of Obamacare. I have Dr. Price here. He and I were both members of Congress when the debate over Obamacare happened in the Congress seven years ago. I can still hear those promises ringing in my ears, can't you? If you like your doctor, you can keep them -- not true. If you liked your health insurance, you can keep it -- not true. The cost of health insurance would go down if Obamacare passed -- not true.\nWe all know the facts. Even though we were promised that families would save $2,500 a year in premiums if Obamacare became law, according to our analysis at HHS, the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than a plan did as recently as 2013. While premiums are soaring, choices are plummeting. Next year at least 40 percent of American counties, including nine entire states, will have only one choice of a health insurance provider, which is essentially no choice at all. And in many jurisdictions around the country, there's not even one choice. So the time has come for Congress to act.\nThe President and I are truly grateful to the organizations represented around here for lending your voices -- voices for working families, voices for businesses large and small -- to our effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we just urge you in the days that remain between now and this vote early next week to reach out to people across this country and let them know that we're close. We literally are just a few votes away from beginning a debate that will repeal and replace Obamacare in the United States Senate.\nCongress needs to step up. Congress needs to do their job. And every member of the United States Senate should vote to begin the debate to rescue the American people from the disastrous policy of Obamacare, and we're grateful for your support.\nWith that, I want to recognize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, for this thoughts on this moment.\nAnd let me just say this is a historic moment. For seven years, the American people have seen the broken promises of Obamacare, and we are just days away and a few short moments and just a few votes away from being able to keep a promise that every Republican in the Senate, every Republican in the House has made to the American people.\nAnd our message today, our message to each one of you and the groups that you represent is make sure the American people know that it's time for Congress to act. And it's time for the American people to let their voice be heard. There is no voice more powerful in Washington, D.C. than the voice of the American people.\nTom?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You're right, it is an historic moment. This is an historic room, and this an historic time for the American people and for your organizations.\nI just want to thank you -- lend my echoing words of the Vice President -- but to thank each and every one of you for the productive and positive discussion and action that you have brought about over the past number of months. Time is of the essence. The fact is that the American people deserve and demand that Washington addresses their problems and their challenges, and this is a challenge that is not unknown to anybody who has been paying attention at all. And that is that the American people desire that healthcare be in the hands of people, in the hands of patients and their families and doctors -- not in the hands of Washington, D.C. That's what this is all about.\nThere are decisions that will be made over the next few weeks in states all across this land about what 2018 looks like from an insurance standpoint, and the decision that is made in the next few days in this town will dictate and determine what those decisions will be. So as people are wont to say, this problem demands an act of Congress, and so it's an act of Congress that must happen. And we, once again, just can't thank you all enough for being that positive and productive influence on this discussion and this debate.\nThank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tom. Let's send a very clear message in the days ahead that the beginning of the end of Obamacare is when Congress votes to start the debate on a bill that will repeal and replace this disastrous policy.\nEarly next week, every Republican in the Senate will be called upon to vote to begin the debate, and we urge each and every one of you on all the platforms that you have and all the millions of Americans that you reach to make sure every American knows that every Republican in the Senate should vote to begin the debate. Because once we begin the debate, the President and I are confident, working with all of you, working with the majority in the United States Senate that we will pass legislation out of the Senate, we will move this legislation forward, and we will rescue the American people from the disaster of Obamacare.\nSo let's go to work.

In the address, the President referred to Proclamation 9627.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126757", "text": "My fellow Americans, on Monday, I signed a Presidential proclamation declaring this to be Made in America Week. We believe that our country is stronger, safer, and more prosperous when we make more of our goods and our products right here in the U.S.A. When we purchase products made in America, the wealth, revenue, and jobs all stay in our country, to be enjoyed by our people.\nSince we first won our independence, our Founders and many of our greatest leaders have promoted that we should afford a special level of protection to the products and goods manufactured within our borders. They understood that as a nation, we have common bonds with our fellow citizens and common obligations to each other. Making and buying \"Made in America\" products brings us closer and strengthens the ties that link us all together.\nFor too long, our Government's policies have punished production in America while rewarding and encouraging the movement of production overseas, which is totally ridiculous. The result has been the loss of numerous industries, the decimation of entire communities, and years of sluggish growth and flat wages.\nThroughout American history, our Nation's best leaders have believed in the importance of protecting our domestic industry. This includes every President on Mount Rushmore.\nGeorge Washington encouraged Americans to produce their own goods so that our young nation could become truly independent. Thomas Jefferson wrote that Americans should choose products made in America whenever possible, and by the way, I'm asking you to do that. Abraham Lincoln warned that abandoning the policies that protect American industry would \"produce want and ruin among our people.\" Theodore Roosevelt stated in his first message to Congress that \"Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection.\" James Monroe called on our Nation to \"cherish and sustain our manufacturers.\" James Garfield said of our Nation's manufacturers, \"To them the country owes the splendor of the position it holds before the world.\" William McKinley believed that when America protects our workers and industries, we \"open up a higher and better destiny for our people.\" And Calvin Coolidge stated that protecting American industry \"enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive a better rate of compensation than any people, any time, anywhere on Earth, ever enjoyed.\"\nWe are now, under the Trump administration, reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation. We are fighting to provide a level playing field for American workers and industries. Other countries will cease taking advantage of us, believe me.\nWe are going to build works of beauty and wonder with American hands, American grit, and American iron, aluminum, and steel. No longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. Instead, we will follow two simple but very crucial rules: We will buy American, and we will hire American.\nAlready, we have created over a million jobs this year and doing even better than anticipated. We're just getting started. Believe me, we're just getting started. For every job that comes back to this country and every factory that reopens and every town that is revitalized, we aren't just restoring American wealth, we are restoring American pride. We are restoring America's future, a future where millions will be lifted from welfare to work, where children will grow up in safe and vibrant communities, and where our Nation will stand stronger than ever before. And most importantly, it will be a future in which you, our citizens, always come first.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America. We are truly making it great again.", "timestamp": "2017-07-21", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Today it's my distinct privilege to welcome to the White House three of the five living survivors of the USS Arizona. This is their first time to our Nation's Capital: Ken, Lauren, and Don. I hope this trip does honor to you and your truly heroic service, and we want to thank you, thank you all. That is so great. Thank you very much.\nColorado Springs, CO, resident Donald G. Stratton. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you for giving me the nicest hardware, plus a beautiful hat. Right? Very, very beautiful. Thank you.\nFor these three World War II veterans, December 7, 1941, the brutal attack on Pearl Harbor is forever seared into their memories. It's also seared into America's memory, because on that grim day, this mighty Nation was roused to defend freedom itself.\nEach of them has a harrowing story of courage to share. They tell us of the American spirit under fire and of the will of our people to defeat threats to our Nation and to the civilized world.\nOne of the heroes with us today is Ken Potts. Ken was on the shore at Pearl Harbor when the attack began. Rather than flee from the fire and the chaos, he drove his small boat into the blazing hot water. He climbed aboard the sinking Arizona, and he carried off passengers one by one.\nKen, it is an honor to meet you, an American hero whose love of our country and love of his brothers was greater than his concern for his own safety. And he paid a very big price. He's gone through life in a little bit worse condition than he could have, but he was very, very happy that he did it.\nWe're deeply grateful that you're here today with us nearly 76 years after that December morning. You are a living witness to history and a living example of true American courage. Ken, so how are you doing? All right?\nProvo, UT, resident H. Kenton Potts. Fine.\nThe President. You doing good?\nMr. Potts. Good\nThe President. You're feeling good?\nMr. Potts. Good.\nThe President. You'd better believe it. [Laughter] He looks good to me. Thank you very much. Fantastic. Thank you.\nLauren Bruner and Donald Stratton are also with us. They were on the deck of the USS Arizona, doing their duty, when the ship was engulfed by massive, massive flames. They were both fortunate enough to be rescued by another courageous hero, Joe George, whose daughter, Joe Ann, is with us today. Joe was in a boat next to the USS Arizona and, when he saw several men still standing, hurled a rope onto the deck of the ship at tremendous risk to himself. Lauren and Don clung to that rope, and hand over hand, they crossed through the 70 feet of flames, burning endlessly.\nThe story of Lauren and Don's devotion and duty doesn't end there. Despite suffering terrible burns, still with them today, they both served in the Navy for years after, fighting in some of the greatest Pacific engagements in World War II. Lauren and Don, thank you very much for your lifetime of service and your lifetime of sacrifice. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nMr. Stratton. Thank you.\nThe President. Feel pretty good, right? Looks good to me.\nMr. Stratton. Well, I'm hanging in there.\nThe President. Have long are you together? Listen to this one, folks. [Laughter]\nMr. Stratton. Sixty-seven years. My wife.\nThe President. That's a long time. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Thank you.\nMr. Stratton. You bet. Thank you.\nThe President. That is beautiful.\nAs Lauren and Don will tell you, they're here because one man, Joe George, stopped at nothing to save them. Joe George rescued six men that day. He is no longer with us, but he will always honor and remember a man—and we will always do this—whose courage knew no limits. His name will go down in history: very brave, very strong.\nJoe Ann, your father makes us all proud. Thank you for inspiring our Nation by telling the story of your father: a true patriot; a well-known man; a man that goes down, really, in the history with the Arizona; and a total hero. Thank you very much. Thank you, Joe Ann. That's very nice.\nCabot, AR, resident Joe Ann Taylor. We're very proud of him.\nThe President. Thank you. You should be, right? Thank you, sweetheart. That's so nice. Thank you for being here. I think you loved him, huh?\nMs. Taylor. I loved him very much. And I know you understand, because you have your daughters.\nThe President. I do.\nMs. Taylor. You understand the relationship.\nThe President. That's true. Thank you, Joe Ann. Appreciate it.\nThere are many remarkable things that I witness as President, but nothing can take the place of meeting heroes like those with us today. In them we see the strength of our Nation, the courage of our men and women in uniform, the resolve to never accept failure, and the belief that justice will always triumph and that the America—and the America that we know and love, the United States—will always prevail. We will always prevail.\nAnd by the way, we're building it up bigger—you know this. Lieutenant Junior Grade Matthew Previts, USN. Yes, sir.\nThe President. We're building it up bigger and stronger and better than ever before. Our military is very proud again, aren't they?\nLt. (J.G.) Previts. Yes, sir.\nThe President. They see what's happening.\nLt. (J.G.) Previts. Indeed.\nThe President. They're looking at the day's budget, and they're seeing lots of ships, right? [Laughter] And lots of planes. Lots of great equipment.\nLt. (J.G.) Previts. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Ken, Lauren, Don, and Joe Ann, I want to thank you for reminding us who we are, where we come from, and why we never, ever give up. Your story gives us all inspiration to do the right thing for our country, our countrymen, and for our God. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you all.\nWhite House Personnel Changes\nQ. Mr. President, what are you trying to accomplish with your staff shakeup today? Can you explain to us what you're trying to accomplish?\nThe President. Make America great again.\nQ. Anything you can tell us?\nMr. Stratton. It's getting there. It's getting there.\nThe President. We're getting there, right?\nMr. Stratton. Oh, you bet.\nThe President. We're getting there fast. You want to hear this, folks. It's very interesting. Just a very beautiful statement.

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126750", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Policy. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States. The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. Modern supply chains, however, are often long and the ability of the United States to manufacture or obtain goods critical to national security could be hampered by an inability to obtain various essential components, which themselves may not be directly related to national security. Thus, the United States must maintain a manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains capable of manufacturing or supplying those items.\nThe loss of more than 60,000 American factories, key companies, and almost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000 threatens to undermine the capacity and capabilities of United States manufacturers to meet national defense requirements and raises concerns about the health of the manufacturing and defense industrial base. The loss of additional companies, factories, or elements of supply chains could impair domestic capacity to create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore capabilities essential for national security.\nAs the manufacturing capacity and defense industrial base of the United States have been weakened by the loss of factories and manufacturing jobs, so too have workforce skills important to national defense. This creates a need for strategic and swift action in creating education and workforce development programs and policies that support job growth in manufacturing and the defense industrial base.\nStrategic support for a vibrant domestic manufacturing sector, a vibrant defense industrial base, and resilient supply chains is therefore a significant national priority. A comprehensive evaluation of the defense industrial base and supply chains, with input from multiple executive departments and agencies (agencies), will provide a necessary assessment of our current strengths and weaknesses.\nSec. 2. Assessment of the Manufacturing Capacity, Defense Industrial Base, and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States. Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretaries of Commerce, Labor, Energy, and Homeland Security, and in consultation with the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, and the heads of such other agencies as the Secretary of Defense deems appropriate, shall provide to the President an unclassified report, with a classified annex as needed, that builds on current assessment and evaluation activities, and: (a) identifies the military and civilian materiel, raw materials, and other goods that are essential to national security;\n(b) identifies the manufacturing capabilities essential to producing the goods identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, including emerging capabilities;\n(c) identifies the defense, intelligence, homeland, economic, natural, geopolitical, or other contingencies that may disrupt, strain, compromise, or eliminate the supply chains of goods identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section (including as a result of the elimination of, or failure to develop domestically, the capabilities identified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section) and that are sufficiently likely to arise so as to require reasonable preparation for their occurrence;\n(d) assesses the resiliency and capacity of the manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains of the United States to support national security needs upon the occurrence of the contingencies identified pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, including an assessment of:\n(i) the manufacturing capacity of the United States and the physical plant capacity of the defense industrial base, including their ability to modernize to meet future needs;\n(ii) gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities, including non-existent, extinct, threatened, and single-point-of-failure capabilities;\n(iii) supply chains with single points of failure or limited resiliency, especially at suppliers third-tier and lower;\n(iv) energy consumption and opportunities to increase resiliency through better energy management;\n(v) current domestic education and manufacturing workforce skills;\n(vi) exclusive or dominant supply of the goods (or components thereof) identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section by or through nations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable; and\n(vii) the availability of substitutes for or alternative sources for the goods identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section;\n(e) identifies the causes of any aspect of the defense industrial base or national-security-related supply chains assessed as deficient pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; and\n(f) recommends such legislative, regulatory, and policy changes and other actions by the President or the heads of agencies as they deem appropriate based upon a reasoned assessment that the benefits outweigh the costs (broadly defined to include any economic, strategic, and national security benefits or costs) over the short, medium, and long run to:\n(i) avoid, or prepare for, any contingencies identified pursuant to subsection (c) of this section;\n(ii) ameliorate any aspect of the defense industrial base or national-security-related supply chains assessed as deficient pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; and\n(iii) strengthen the United States manufacturing capacity and defense industrial base and increase the resiliency of supply chains critical to national security.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Thank you very much, Secretary Mattis, for that wonderful introduction and for your devoted service to our Nation. Nobody has done it like you. I'm thrilled to be back on this magnificent ship for this historic moment with the amazing men and women of the United States Navy.\nI was with you 4 months ago, and I knew that I had to be here today, and I told you I'd be back to congratulate you and the crew and everybody involved on commissioning the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of this world. That's a big achievement.\nAfter today, wherever this ship sails, you will all carry a proud title: plankowner of the USS Gerald R. Ford. For the rest of your lives, you'll be able to tell your friends and family that you served on the greatest ship in the United States Navy and, in my opinion, on the greatest ship anywhere in the world. Everyone should take a moment to celebrate this incredible achievement.\nI want to thank the many public servants who have joined us here today: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Governor Snyder, Governor McAuliffe, Senator Wicker and Members of Congress, Secretary Stackley, Admiral Richardson, senior military leaders, and of course, the great Captain McCormack.\nCaptain, I know you will exemplify integrity at the helm. And have a good time doing it, Captain. Proud of you.\nThanks to the entire Ford family—Susan, Jack, Steve, and Mike—for all that you've done to support this ship on its voyage. Thank you, Susan. Thank you.\nI also want to recognize two other people who were very special to President Ford. Thank you, Vice President Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. Thank you. They look great. They look great.\nAs we put this stunning ship into the service of our Nation, we must also pay tribute to the thousands of citizens, military and civilian, who helped design and build her. Their love of country has been poured into every rivet and bulkhead on this vessel. You hammered, chiseled, and sculpted this mighty hull.\nYou were there when the first steel was cut, when the turbines first roared to life, and when those beautiful bronze propellers first began to spin—and spin they did. And now you are here to witness the moment when your incredible work of art becomes the pride of the United States Navy and a symbol of American power and prestige, no matter where in the world you go.\nAmerican steel and American hands have constructed a 100,000-ton message to the world: American might is second to none, and we're getting bigger and better and stronger every day of my administration. That I can tell you. Wherever this vessel cuts through the horizon, our allies will rest easy, and our enemies will shake with fear, because everyone will know that America is coming and America is coming strong.\nTo every worker from Newport News Shipbuilding and every craftsman and engineer who helped build this incredible fortress on the sea, today we salute you. Thank you.\nYour skill and your grit build the instruments of war that preserve peace. This ship is the deterrent that keeps us from having to fight in the first place. But this ship also ensures that if a fight does come, it will always end the same way; we will win, win, win. We will never lose. We will win.\nWhen it comes to battle, we don't want a fair fight. We want just the opposite. We demand victory, and we will have total victory, believe me.\nHaving the best technology and equipment is only one part of the American military dominance. Our true strength is our people. Our greatest weapon is all of you. Our Nation endures because we have citizens who love America and who are willing to fight for America. We are so very blessed with warriors who are willing to serve America in the greatest fighting force in the history: the United States military.\nToday this ship officially begins its role in the noble military history of our great Nation. In a few moments, I will commission this wonderful, beautiful, but very, very powerful warship. Captain McCormack will assume command. He will set the first watch, and then, the crew of the Gerald R. Ford will man the ship and bring her to life.\nA ship is only as good as the people who serve on it, and the American sailor is the best anywhere in the world. Among you are great welders, radar technicians, machine operators, and pilots. You take pride in your work, and America takes pride in you. We love you. We are proud of you. Thank you.\nBut that is why it is so fitting that this ship is named after a sailor of tremendous character, integrity, and wisdom. You know that, Susan. Gerald Ford was raised in American heartland. He grew up in Grand Rapids and became an Eagle Scout. He played football at the University of Michigan on a team that won two national championships. And listen to this: On that great team, he was named MVP. Not bad.\nHe then went to Yale Law School, and after Pearl Harbor, he volunteered to serve. President Ford joined the Navy and asked to be sent to sea. He wanted to do that very badly. He never really knew why; he felt it was a calling. He was assigned to a new carrier—the Monterey—becoming a plankowner himself on its commissioning in 1943.\nFrom there, he sailed to the Pacific and saw action—and a lot of action—in the Pacific war. Like so many others of his generation, Gerald Ford returned home and started a family. He ran for Congress, where he served the people of Michigan with honor for many years. From there, he became Vice President and then President of the United States of America.\nWith this ship, we honor him for his lifetime of selfless and distinguished service. We also remember his wife Betty—I remember her well—and we honor the bravery she showed in living her life so that her experiences could help others. Susan, she was a great woman—a great woman.\nGerald Ford said that his time in the Navy convinced him that our lack of military preparation before World War II has only encouraged our enemies to fight harder and harder and harder. He learned a lot. In the future, Ford said, I felt the United States had to be strong. Never again could we allow our military to be anything but the absolute best. If he could see this ship today, President Gerald Ford would see his vision brought to life, and he would see his legacy of service being carried on by each and every one of you.\nGerald Ford embodied American values like few others: love of family, love of freedom, and most of all, love of country. He knew that patriotism is the heartbeat of a nation. He knew that we must love our country in order to protect it. And he knew that we must have pride in our history if we are going to have confidence in our future.\nThe men and women of America's Armed Services are part of a living history. You uphold timeless customs and traditions, and you protect our Nation and our freedom for the next generation to come. You are fulfilling your duty to this Nation, and now it is the job of our Government to fulfill its duty to you.\nFor years, our Government has subjected the military to unpredictable funding and a devastating defense sequester. You remember that? Sequester, not good. This has led to deferred maintenance, a lack of investment in new equipment and technology, and a shortfall in military readiness. In other words, it's been a very, very bad period of time for our military. That is why we reached a deal to secure an additional $20 billion for defense this year—and it's going up—and why I asked Congress for another $54 billion for next year.\nNow we need Congress to do its job and pass the budget that provides for higher, stable, and predictable funding levels for our military needs that our fighting men and women deserve—and you will get, believe me. President Trump, I, will tell you: You will get it. Don't worry about it. But I don't mind getting a little hand, so call that Congressman and call that Senator and make sure you get it.\nAnd by the way, you can also call those Senators to make sure you get health care. [Laughter]\nWe must end the defense sequester once and for all. We must also reform defense acquisitions to ensure that we are getting the best equipment at the best prices so that our dollars are used only for the best interests of our country and those who serve. We do not want cost overruns. We want the best equipment, but we want it built ahead of schedule, and we want it build under budget.\nThis is the very least we can do for the patriots who have volunteered to give their sweat, their blood, and if they must, their very lives for our great Nation. The commissioning of this new American carrier marks the renewal of our commitment to a future of American greatness. Greater than ever before, remember that—greater than ever before.\nJust moments from now, the Captain will set the first watch on the USS Gerald R. Ford, and with God's grace, a watch will stand until the day she is decommissioned 50 years or more from now.\nMost of you who will man this ship today are just about 20 years old. Together, you are embarking on a truly great adventure. The journey will require all of your talents, all of your efforts, and all of your heart. As you know, the sea holds many challenges and threats. But starting today, you will face, together as a team aboard this ship, which is your responsibility and your home.\nThree generations of Americans will eventually man these decks. Perhaps even some of your own children and grandchildren someday. You will inspire many more American patriots to follow your lead and to serve. And one day, when you are old and have lived a long and, hopefully, happy and successful life, you may find yourselves back aboard this ship surrounded by your family to mark its decommissioning. And on that day, our entire Nation will honor not just this carrier, it will honor you and the role you will have played in keeping America safe, strong, and free.\nTo every patriot who will serve on this ship today and throughout history, I say this: Keep the watch, protect her, defend her, and love her. Good luck and Godspeed. Thank you to the Ford family, and thank you to every sailor in the greatest navy on Earth. God bless you, God bless the Gerald R. Ford, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. God bless you all.\nUSS Gerald R. Ford Commanding Officer Captain Richard C. McCormack, USN. Thank you, Mr. President. And I would be honored if you would place Gerald R. Ford in commission.\nUSS Gerald R. Ford Executive Officer Captain Brent Gaut, USN. Will the guests please rise. Ship's company, attention.\nThe President. I hereby place United States Ship Gerald R. Ford in commission. May God bless and guide this warship and all who shall sail in her. God bless you.

He is fighting for you, and he will keep fighting every day until we give the American people access to the world-class health care they deserve.\nTomorrow, the United States Senate will have the opportunity to begin the debate on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. And as the President said this morning, after years of talking and campaigning on it, now is the time for Republicans in the Senate to act. Republicans in the Senate will have in his words a \"chance to do the right thing\" to keep their promise to the American people and these families and families all across this country. And this President and the American people are counting on the Senate to act.\nSo with gratitude for his leadership and his persistence and determination to make American health care great again, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to these families and to all of you the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump.

SANDERS: We've got a couple special guests. I'm going to let -- I know we're tight on time -- if we have to, we'll come back on the way back and answer a few more questions, but I'm going to let Secretary Price kick off, give a little update on healthcare, talk about some of the stuff from today, and then I'll answer questions after that.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, it's an honor to join President Trump on this trip to the Boy Scout Jamboree.\nBut regarding healthcare, we've had a number of conversations, obviously, over the weekend, and we're looking forward to a positive vote tomorrow in the Senate. Senator McConnell has assured his members that the vote will occur, and the President is adamant about moving forward and getting on a bill so that we can have the debate, have the discussion, and move forward on behalf of the American people.\nThere are folks who are hurting out there. We had an event at the White House today that had a number of families -- four families from across the country, many with children -- who have been harmed by the current policies of Obamacare. So our goal is to fix that -- is to move in a better direction where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions and not Washington, D.C. So we look forward to a positive outcome tomorrow.\nMS. SANDERS: All right, we'll take a few questions.\nQ: -- have Senator Lee's vote now?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Beg your pardon.\nQ: Do you think you have Senator Lee's vote now?\nSECRETARY PRICE: We look forward to having at least 50 votes in the Senate, and the Vice President will be there, obviously, tomorrow in order to break a tie if there is a tie. But you can't begin to solve this challenge and crisis of Obamacare without voting to proceed on the legislation and having the debate. As the Vice President says, as the President says, this vote is to begin the debate on the repeal of Obamacare.\nQ: Senator Collins said yesterday that she hadn't received a call from the President on this topic. Does the President plan to pick up the phone and call some senators himself?\nSECRETARY PRICE: We've talked to virtually every single Republican senator. The Senator has been at the White House on a number of occasions. There have been conversations that have gone back and forth, so I think that the input that we have taken from senators has been extraordinary and, frankly, unprecedented. Having been involved in these healthcare conversations and debates for years, this is the greatest amount of involvement by a President that I have ever witnessed one-on-one with members of Congress -- both the House and the Senate.\nThank you, all.\nMS. SANDERS: We'll jump straight in -- since we're short on time -- on other questions.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in the Middle East? I know that we have some envoys over there, but the U.N. warned today that if things aren't solved by Friday prayers, things could really spin out of control. What is the administration doing to try to lessen tensions in Jerusalem?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly an effort to deescalate is important. Jason Greenblatt has gone over -- arrived earlier today -- and we're not going to get ahead of any conversations that he has, but he is meeting with a number of people while he's there. And we'll keep you guys updated as those meetings take place.\nQ: Sarah, what does the President mean when he said that Jeff Sessions was beleaguered? What did he mean by that?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President has been extremely clear about his position. I know I've answered this question a number of times over the last week. He's very disappointed that Attorney General Sessions chose to recuse himself, and there's not much more to add beyond what we've already said on the matter.\nQ: And there are some reports that he was at the White House today. Can you share any information about that?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. I can confirm he was at the White House, but he did not meet with the President while he was there today.\nQ: Does the President actually want Attorney General Sessions to open an investigation into Hillary Clinton or is he making a political point?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Does the President actually want the Attorney General to open an investigation into Hillary Clinton or is he making a political point?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that he would hope that the Department of Justice would look into any potential area where the law could have been broken, and if they think there's a possibility of that, then certainly they should take a look.\nQ: Sarah, is the President going to sign the new sanctions bill?\nMS. SANDERS: In regards to the sanctions bill, the President has been very vocal about his support for continuing sanctions on those three countries. He has no intention of getting rid of them, but he wants to make sure we get the best deal for the American people possible. Congress does not have the best record on that. I think you can look at NAFTA, you can look at the Iran deal, and the President wants to make sure that we actually get the best deal for the United States. And so he's very focused on that, but at the same time wants to make sure that sanctions on those three countries remain, and he's going to study that legislation and see what the final product looks like.\nQ: If it looks like it does now, does he approve of it?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: If it looks like it does now -- as they currently have it shaped and they plan to vote on it tomorrow, is he fine that -- he's supportive of that, right?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said, he's looking over where it stands exactly at this point, and we'll keep you guys posted on the decision. I think the important part of this is that the President very much supports sanctions on those countries and wants to make sure that those remain; but at the same time, wants to make sure that we get good deals. And those two things are both very important for the President.\nQ: Did the President talk to Jared Kushner after he came back from the Hill?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that the President was very proud of Jared for voluntarily going to the Hill and being very transparent with every interaction that he's had. He thought Jared did a great job and was very glad that he was able to go through that process and lay everything out and I think show the members of that committee, as well as everybody else, what a witch hunt and hoax this whole thing is. And we're going to continue pushing forward and focus on things the American people actually care about, and Russia is I don't think really it.\nQ: Did they talk afterwards?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not sure if they talked, but I know that he watched and saw Jared's statement and thought he did a great job.\nQ: -- statement that was made on the driveway, did he help craft it, or did he have any role in crafting it?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, but I'd have to check to be sure. I just don't know.\nQ: Sarah, the Secretary said the President has been more engaged than he's seen in the past. Does the buck stop with the President whatever happens? Whether this passes or fails, is it the President's responsibility on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure, I'll let Secretary Price weigh in. He's said that --\nSECRETARY PRICE: What was the question?\nQ: Does the buck stop with the President? You said he's been more engaged than any President you've seen. So if this fails, is it his responsibility?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, all of us in the administration understand and appreciate that the current healthcare system for the individual and small-group market and many in Medicaid just simply isn't working. That's the President's passion about this. He wants to fix this for the American people.\nIt's not whether or not the patients are able to see the doctor that they want to see necessarily; it's that he wants to fix the system itself. And so that's the charge that he's given us.\nQ: Have Republicans done enough? Has the President done enough, the administration, too? Obviously, today the talk was a lot about the problems with Obamacare. Have you guys done enough to sell what the Senate is hoping to begin debate on this week, the new bill?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, as I say, we've reached out to virtually every single senator who is interested in moving forward in a positive direction, the President has personally to so many. And the status quo is simply untenable. You can't have people that are paying premiums that have deductibles that they can't afford, so they have an insurance card, but they don't have any care. That's a system that may work for insurance companies. It may have worked for the previous administration. But it doesn't work for patients, and that's what we're trying to correct.\nQ: Have you done enough to sell to the public, though? The public polling is that the new bill looks even less popular than Obamacare. Do you think more needs to be done to explain to the American people what's in the Senate bill?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, when the opponents of what we're trying to do aren't constrained by the truth, it's a challenge. So we continue to put our message out there, the message that we believe that patients and families and doctors ought to be the ones making medical decisions -- not Washington, D.C.; the message that we believe that health coverage and care ought to be affordable and accessible to the American people of the highest quality and provide choices for patients.\nThat's not the system that we currently have in so many areas. That's why the President has such a passion for this.\nQ: Sarah, do you think we're going to see the steel report? Are we going to see the steel report this week?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll keep you posted when we have an announcement on that front.\nQ: Sarah, can you tell us about the President rejecting the Afghanistan plan that H.R. McMaster and the national security team presented to him this last week?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to weigh in on anything at this time, but we'll certainly keep you guys posted as the progress moves forward on that front.\nAnd we're about to land, so I'll take one last question.\nQ: Are we going to have on-camera briefings from now on? Is this the new precedent?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we've always maintained the idea that we're going to do things in a way to get the message out. We've had a mix of both on- and off-camera briefings, and we'll continue to do that and do our best to provide as many on-camera briefings as possible.\nThanks, guys.\nQ: Thanks.\nEND 5:11 P.M.

Rothfus, R-PA, and 33 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.J. Res. 111. This joint resolution of disapproval would nullify the \"Arbitration Agreements\" rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 33210 (July 19, 2017), promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The rule would bar certain financial institutions from using contract clauses that provide for arbitration of disputes with customers to restrict participation in class-action lawsuits. If allowed to take effect, the CFPB's harmful rule would benefit trial lawyers by increasing frivolous class-action lawsuits; harm consumers by denying them the full benefits and efficiencies of arbitration; and hurt financial institutions by increasing litigation expenses and compliance costs (particularly for community and mid-sized institutions). In many cases, these increased costs would be borne, not by the financial institutions, but by their consumers. The CFPB's rule is also in tension with the policy expressed by Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act, as recognized repeatedly by the Supreme Court, favoring resolution of disputes through arbitration. The Administration is committed to protecting Americans by making regulation efficient and effective and restoring public accountability within the Federal financial regulatory agencies as outlined in Executive Order 13772, Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System. This legislation would protect consumer choices by eliminating a costly and burdensome regulation and reining in the bureaucracy and inadvisable regulatory actions of the CFPB.\nIf H.J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127973", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ)\nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3219, making appropriations for defense, military construction, Veterans Affairs, the Legislative Branch, energy and water development, and for other purposes for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2018.\nThis package is a strong step to fulfilling the President's promise to put the safety of the American people first. The bill ensures our security abroad by funding operations to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), rebuilding our military after years of neglect, and improving our missile defense capabilities to defend against threats from North Korea and other adversaries. It protects us at home by providing for construction of the border wall. It also keeps faith with those who defend us by generously funding care for our veterans. In addition, the bill makes major investments in our military and civilian infrastructure, supporting our economy while improving our security.\nThe Administration strongly supports the Committee's commitment to include the President's border wall proposal, which is a critical element of the President's strategy to secure the borders. This proposal provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction along the southwest border, including $784 million for 32 miles of new border fencing in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas, $498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall in RGV, $251 million for 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego, California, and $38 million for program planning and management. Physical barriers are vital for border security because they deter, prevent, and deny potential illegal border crossings, for illegal alien movement generally and for human smuggling and drug smuggling specifically. The funding provided in the bill would allow Customs and Border Protection to make critical investments in the areas of the border with the highest current risk and the greatest current operational need. The Administration strongly supports these efforts.\nThe bill provides $667.7 billion for the Department of Defense, including $74.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The previous administration signed into law harmful cuts to defense spending. This Administration strongly supports restoring America's investment in defense. To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration strongly supports fiscally responsible reductions to spending elsewhere in the Federal Budget, as outlined in the FY 2018 Budget request.\nVeterans' access to timely, high-quality healthcare and services is a top priority, and the Administration appreciates the bill's provision of $78.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a $3.9 billion increase above FY 2017. This funding supports care for our veterans as well as crucial reforms to the VA to reduce the disability claims backlog and provide greater oversight and accountability.\nIf H.R. 3219 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill. The Administration may also provide more detail regarding its views in the future, including constitutional concerns, on other provisions.\nDivision A - Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)\nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC). The Administration strongly objects to section 8113, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for proposing, planning, or executing a new BRAC round. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting resources on unneeded infrastructure. The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save an additional $2 billion or more annually—resources it could apply to higher priorities such as readiness and modernization.\nPalau Compact Funding. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the $124 million requested to fulfill the entire remaining United States financial commitment to the Republic of Palau under the 2010 Compact Review Agreement (CRA). The CRA requires payment of United States commitments in full to enact the Agreement. Failure to fund the CRA could imperil ongoing national security initiatives with the Republic of Palau and jeopardize United States access and influence in a region that is increasingly contested by China.\nMissile Defense Programs. The Administration objects to the reduction of $308 million to United States Ballistic Missile Defense programs during a period of escalating threats from North Korea to the homeland and allies of the United States.\nCounter-ISIL Train and Equip Fund (CTEF). The Administration objects to the $112.5 million in rescissions to CTEF. These reductions would limit DOD's ability to quickly and effectively provide assistance to partners fighting ISIS, undermining the Administration's \"by, with, and through\" strategy to degrade, dismantle, and ultimately defeat ISIS.\nCoalition Support Fund (CSF). The Administration objects to the $450 million in reductions, which includes a rescission to CSF. These reductions would limit DOD's ability to reimburse key partners in the fight against ISIS and other extremist groups in the region. The rescission, notably, would reduce funds available for programs that are already underway. Furthermore, the rescission would inhibit the Executive Branch's ability to conduct foreign policy, limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the national security interest of the United States, and unnecessarily complicate relationships with key partners.\nInnovation and Enhancing Combat Capability. The Administration objects to the reduction of $170 million to the Strategic Capabilities Office FY 2018 Budget request. Specifically, the Administration is concerned that this reduction would add considerable risk to the timely demonstration and transition of critical warfighter capabilities.\nDivision C - Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of Defense\nNext National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency West (N2W) Campus. The Administration objects to the Committee's decision to reduce N2W by $181 million through an incremental funding approach and recommends that funding be provided at the FY 2018 Budget request level. The Administration is opposed to such use of incremental funding for military construction projects because it undermines program stability and cost discipline and could negatively impact other mission-critical priorities. In the case of this project, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency expects to obligate the full amount of the Budget request in FY 2018.\nDivision D - Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018\nCorps of Engineers\nAgency Topline. The Administration appreciates the bill's investments in the Nation's water resources through the Corps of Engineers civil works program, but believes that funding should be limited to the amounts requested in the FY 2018 Budget. The Budget focused on investments to maintain the performance of the key features of existing water resources infrastructure that the Corps owns and operates and the navigation channels that serve the Nation's largest coastal ports. It also supports the construction of projects that would provide a high economic or environmental return to the Nation or that would address a significant risk to public safety.\nDepartment of Energy\nMixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility Termination. The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility as directed in the bill. The project is unaffordable and risky. The most recent estimates, conducted by the Department of Energy and the Corps of Engineers, project $12 billion in remaining construction costs, and total construction costs of $17 billion when including $5 billion in sunk costs to date. In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two decades. The alternative—dilute and dispose—is a proven approach with significantly less risk and expense, and can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach.\nExcess Facilities. The Administration strongly opposes the $150 million reduction to the request to dispose of excess facilities at the Department of Energy sites that are not in the Environmental Management program. These resources are critical to addressing the increasing risks these facilities pose. The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested $225 million to protect the health and safety of workers and the public, and support modernization of the nuclear security enterprise.\nNuclear Waste Management (Interim Storage and Yucca Mountain Licensing). While the Administration supports the inclusion of $120 million for nuclear waste management activities, the Administration strongly opposes the prohibition on using funds appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for interim storage activities.\nApplied Energy Programs. The Administration commends the Committee for beginning to shift the focus of applied energy research and development to earlier-stage activities where the Federal role is strongest, but strongly encourages the Congress to accelerate this shift and further reduce funding for costly later-stage development, commercialization, and deployment activities, some of which are unauthorized.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2017-07-24", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3219 - Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018"}

These bills include H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, and the Senate amendment to H.R. 1628, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017.

This bill repeals Obamacare's damaging individual and employer mandate penalties and its tax increases, while providing a reasonable transition period for the Congress to enact patient-centered healthcare.

The press will say it's about 200 people. [Laughter] It looks like about 45,000 people. You set a record today. You set a record. That's a great honor, believe me.\nTonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington, DC, you've been hearing about with the fake news and all of that. We're going to put that—[applause]—we're going to put that aside. And instead, we're going to talk about success, about how all of you amazing young Scouts can achieve your dreams. What to think of—what I've been thinking about—you want to achieve your dreams. I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts? [Applause] Right?\nThere are many great honors that come with the job of being President of the United States, but looking out at this incredible gathering of mostly young patriots—mostly young—I'm especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. You are the young people of character and integrity who will serve as leaders in our communities and uphold the sacred values of our Nation.\nI want to thank Boy Scouts President Randall Stephenson, Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh, Jamboree Chairman Ralph de la Vega, and the thousands of volunteers who have made this a life-changing experience for all of you. And when they asked me to be here I said absolutely, yes.\nFinally—and we can't forget these people—I especially want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here tonight. Thank you for making scouting possible. Thank you, mom and dad troop leaders. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts, you are not only shaping young lives, you are shaping the future of America.\nThe United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. No better. The values, traditions, and skills you learn here will serve you throughout your lives, and just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and in the present, will serve your country. The Scouts believe in putting America first.\nYou know, I go to Washington, and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp. [Laughter] And it's not a good place. In fact, today I said we ought to change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer. But it's not good. Not good. And I see what's going on, and believe me, I'd much rather be with you. That I can tell you.\nI'll tell you the reason that I love this and the reason that I really wanted to be here is because as President, I rely on former Boy Scouts every single day, and so do the American people. It's amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level of our great Government. Many of my top advisers in the White House were Scouts. Ten members of my Cabinet were Scouts. Can you believe that? Ten.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson is not only a Boy Scout, he's your former national president.

And by the way, where are our Indiana Scouts tonight? I wonder if the television cameras will follow you. They don't like doing that when they see these massive crowds. They don't like doing that. Hi, folks. A lot of love in this big, beautiful place. Lot of love and a lot of love for our country. There's a lot of love for our country.\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. Come here, Ryan. Ryan is an Eagle Scout from Big Sky country in Montana. Pretty good. And by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. He makes sure that we leave our national parks and Federal lands better than we found them, in the best scouting tradition. So thank you very much, Ryan.\nSecretary of Energy Rick Perry, of Texas, an Eagle Scout from the great State. The first time he came to the national jamboree was in 1964. He was very young then. [Laughter] And Rick told me just a little while ago, it totally changed his life. So, Rick, thank you very much for being here. And we're doing a lot with energy.\nAnd very soon, Rick, we will be an energy exporter. Isn't that nice, an energy exporter? In other words, we'll be selling our energy instead of buying it from everybody all over the globe. So that's good.\nSecretary of Energy J. Richard Perry. Yes, sir. Energy dominant.\nThe President. We will be energy dominant. And I'll tell you what, the folks in West Virginia who were so nice to me, boy, have we kept our promise. We are going on and on. So we love West Virginia. We want to thank you.\nWhere's West Virginia, by the way? This—[applause]. Thank you.\nSecretary Tom Price is also here. Today, Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy as our Secretary of Health and Human Services. And he's doing a great job. And hopefully, he's going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare that's really hurting us, folks.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. By the way, you going to get the votes?\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Thomas E. Price. Hope so.\nThe President. He'd better get them. He'd better get them. Oh, he'd better—otherwise, I'll say, Tom, you're fired. I'll get somebody—[laughter].\nYou'd better get Senator Capito to vote for it. You've got to get the other Senators to vote for it. It's time. After 7 years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. They'd better do it. Hopefully, they'll do it.\nAs we can see just by looking at our Government, in America, Scouts lead the way. And another thing I've noticed—and I've noticed it all my life—there is a tremendous spirit with being a Scout, more so than almost anything I can think of. So whatever is going on, keep doing it. It's incredible to watch. Believe me. Each of these leaders will tell you that their road to American success—and you have to understand, their American success, and they are a great, great story, was paved with the patriotic American values and traditions they learned in the Boy Scouts. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the adventures in your lives, you will be able to say the same: I got my start as a Scout just like these incredibly great people that are doing such a good job for our country. So that's going to happen.\nBoy Scout values are American values, and great Boy Scouts become great, great Americans. As the Scout law says: \"A Scout is trustworthy, loyal\"—we could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.\nAudience members. ——\"helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.\"\nThe President. Very good. Very good. That was very impressive. [Laughter] You've heard that before.\nBut here you learn the rewards of hard work and perseverance. Never, ever give up, never quit. Persevere. Never, ever quit.\nYou learn the satisfaction of building a roaring campfire, reaching a mountain summit, or earning a merit badge after mastering a certain skill. There's no better feeling than an achievement that you've earned with your own sweat, tears, resolve, hard work. There's nothing like it. Do you agree with that?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. I'm waving to people back there so small I can't even see them. Man, this is—this is a lot of people. Turn those cameras back there, please. That is so incredible. By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible, massive crowd, record-setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? One percent or zero? The fake media will say: President Trump spoke—and you know what this is—President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today. That's some—that is some crowd.\nFake media. Fake news. Thank you. And I'm honored by that, by the way, all of you people, they can't even see you. So thank you. I hope you can hear.\nThrough scouting you also learn to believe in yourself—so important—to have confidence in your ability and to take responsibility for your own life. When you face down new challenges, and you will have plenty of them, develop talents you never thought possible, and lead your teammates through daring trials, you discover that you can handle anything. And you learn it by being a Scout. It's great.\nYou can do anything. You can be anything you want to be. But in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. You have to find your passion. No what—no matter what they tell you—if you don't—I love you too. I don't know. It's a nice guy. Hey, what am I going to do? He sounds like a nice person. He, he, he, he. Thank you. I do. I do love you.\nAudience members. We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump!\nThe President. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. And we'll be back. We'll be back. The answer is no, and—but we'll be back. In life, in order to be successful—and you people are well on the road to success—you have to find out what makes you excited. What makes you want to get up each morning and go to work? You have to find it.\nIf you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will gain momentum, and look—you have to, you need—the word momentum—you will gain that momentum, and each success will create another success. The word momentum.\nI'll tell you a story that's very interesting for me when I was young. There was a man named William Levitt—Levittowns, you have some here, you have some in different States. Anybody ever hear of Levittown? And he was a very successful man. Became unbelievably—he was a homebuilder—became an unbelievable success and got more and more successful. And he built homes, and at night, he'd go to these major sites with teams of people, and he'd scour the sites for nails and sawdust and small pieces of wood. And they'd clean the site so when the workers came in the next morning, the sites would be spotless and clean, and he did it properly. And he did this for 20 years, and then, he was offered a lot of money for his company.\nAnd he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money—at the time especially, this was a long time ago—sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life. I won't go any more than that because you're Boy Scouts, so I'm not going to tell you what he did.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Should I tell you? Should I tell you?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Oh, you're Boy Scouts, but you know life. You know life. So—look at you. Who would think this is the Boy Scouts, right?\nSo he had a very, very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate. And they didn't know anything about building homes, and they didn't know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it—and the scraps of wood. This was a big conglomerate based in New York City, and after about a 10-year period, they were losing a lot with it. It didn't mean anything to them, and they couldn't sell it.\nSo they called William Levitt up, and they said, would you like to buy back your company, and he said yes, I would. He so badly wanted it; he got bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the South of France and other places. You won't get bored, right? You know, truthfully, you're workers. You'll get bored too, believe me. Of course, having a good few years like that isn't so bad. But what happened is, he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of empty land. And he worked hard in getting in zoning, and he worked hard on starting to develop.\nAnd in the end he failed, and he failed badly. Lost all of his money. He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older. And I saw him at a cocktail party, and it was very sad, because the hottest people in New York were at this party. It was the party of Steve Ross—Steve Ross who was one of the great people—he came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a great guy. He had a lot of successful people at the party.\nAnd I was doing well so I got invited to the party. I was very young, and I go in—but I'm in the real estate business—and I see a hundred people, some of whom I recognize and they're big in the entertainment business. And I see, sitting in the corner, was a little old man who was all by himself. Nobody was talking to him. I immediately recognized that that man was the once-great William Levitt of Levittown, and I immediately went over; I wanted to talk to him more than the Hollywood show business communications people.\nSo I went over and talked to him, and I said, Mr. Levitt, \"I'm Donald Trump.\" He said, \"I know.\" I said, \"Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?\" He goes, \"not well, not well at all.\" And I knew that, but he said \"not well at all.\" And he explained what was happening and how bad it has been and how hard it has been. And I said what exactly happened? Why did this happen to you? You're one of the greats ever in our industry. Why did this happen to you? And he said, Donald, \"I lost my momentum.\" I lost my momentum. A word you never hear when you're talking about success. When some of these guys that never made 10 cents, they're on television giving you things about how you're going to be successful, and the only thing they ever did was a book and a tape.\nBut I'll tell you, I'll tell you, it was very sad, and I never forgot that moment. And I thought about it, and it's exactly true. He lost his momentum. Meaning, he took this period of time off long—years—and then, when he got back, he didn't have that same momentum. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum, and if you don't have it, that's okay. Because you're going to go on, and you're going to learn, and you're going to do things that are great. But you have to know about the word momentum.\nBut the big thing: never quit. Never give up. Do something you love. When you do something you love—as a Scout I see that you love it. But when you do something that you love, you'll never fail. What you're going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. You're ultimately going to be successful, and remember this, you're not working. Because when you're doing something that you love like I do—of course, I love my business, but this is a little bit different. Who thought this was going to happen? We're having a good time. We're doing a good job. [Applause] Doing a good job. But when you do something that you love, remember this, it's not work.\nSo you'll work 24/7, you're going to work all the time, and at the end of a year, you're not really working. You don't think of it as work. When you're not doing something that you like or when you're forced in to do something that you really don't like, that's called work. And it's hard work and tedious work.\nSo as much as you can, do something that you love, work hard, and never ever give up. And you're going to be tremendously successful. Tremendously successful.\nNow, with that, I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up—since the election, November 8. Do we remember that date? Was that a beautiful date?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. What a date. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8, where they said—these dishonest people—where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump? They forgot about the forgotten people. By the way, they're not forgetting about the forgotten people anymore. They're going crazy trying to figure it out. But I told them, far too late. It's far too late.\nBut do you remember that incredible night with the maps—and the Republicans are red, and the Democrats are blue—and that map was so red, it was unbelievable, and they didn't know what to say? And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college—popular vote is much easier. We have—because New York, California, Illinois—you have to practically run the East Coast. And we did. We won Florida. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Pennsylvania.\nWe won and won. So when they said, there is no way to victory, there is no way to 270. I went to Maine four times because it's one vote, and we won. But we won—one vote. I went there because I kept hearing we're at 269. But then, Wisconsin came in. Many, many years—Michigan came in.\nSo—and we worked hard there. My opponent didn't work hard there, because she was told——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. [Laughter] She was told she was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute, the car industry is moving to Mexico. Why is she going to move—she's there. Why are they allowing it to move? And by the way, do you see those car industry—do you see what's happening, how they're coming back to Michigan? They're coming back to Ohio. They're starting to peel back in.\nAnd we go to Wisconsin—now, Wisconsin hadn't been won in many, many years by a Republican. But we go to Wisconsin, and we had tremendous crowds. And I'd leave these massive crowds. I'd say, why are we going to lose this State?\nThe polls, that's also fake news. They're fake polls. But the polls are saying—but we won Wisconsin. So I have to tell you what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for \"Make America Great Again.\"\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. And I'll tell you what, we are, indeed, making America great again. What's going on is incredible.\nWe had the best jobs report in 16 years. The stock market on a daily basis is hitting an alltime high. We're going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars from companies that can't get their money back into this country, and that money is going to be used to help rebuild America. We're doing things that nobody ever thought was possible.\nAnd we've just started. It's just the beginning, believe me.\nIn the Boy Scouts, you learn right from wrong, correct?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. You learn to contribute to your communities, to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. You pledge to help other people at all times. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your best and to do your duty to God and your country.\nAnd by the way, under the Trump administration, you'll be saying \"merry Christmas\" again when you go shopping, believe me. Merry Christmas. They've been downplaying that little, beautiful phrase. You're going to be saying \"merry Christmas\" again, folks.\nBut the words duty, country, and God are beautiful words. In other words, basically, what you're doing is, you're pledging to be a great American patriot. For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been. Last year, you gave more than 15 million hours of service to helping people in your communities. Incredible. That's an incredible stat. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service by the end of this jamboree—100,000.\nWhen natural disaster strikes, when people face hardship, when the beauty and glory of our outdoor spaces must be restored and taken care of, America turns to the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts never, ever, ever let us down.\nJust like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on you because we know the values that you live by. Your values are the same values that have always kept America strong, proud, and free. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of additional money that we're putting back into our military? Billions of dollars. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are so great to us. We love our vets. We love our soldiers. And we love our police, by the way. Firemen, police—we love our police. Those are all special people. Uniformed services.\nTwo days ago, I traveled to Norfolk, Virginia to commission an American aircraft carrier into the fleet of the United States Navy. It's the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it's named for an Eagle Scout, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Everywhere it sails, that great Scout's name will be feared and revered, because that ship will be a symbol of American power, prestige, and strength.\nOur Nation honors President Gerald R. Ford today because he lived his life the scouting way. Boy Scouts celebrate American patriots, especially the brave members of our Armed Forces. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\nAmerican hearts are warmed every year when we read about Boy Scouts placing thousands and thousands of flags next to veterans' gravesites all across the country. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. You should take great pride in the example you set for every citizen of our country to follow.\nGenerations of American Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to same law. You inherit a noble American tradition, and as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of who you are and the principles you hold dear and stand by. Wear your values as your badge of honor. What you've done, few have done before you. What you've done is incredible. What you've done is admired by all. So I want to congratulate you, Boy Scouts.\nLet your scouting oath guide your path from this day forward. Remember your duty. Honor your history. Take care of the people God put into your life. And love and cherish your great country.\nYou are very special people. You're special in the lives of America. You're special to me. But if you do what we say, I promise you that you will live scouting's adventure every single day of your life, and you will win, win, win and help people in doing so.\nYour lives will have meaning and purpose and joy. You will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible, things that you said could never, ever happen are already happening for you. And if you do these things—and if you refuse to give in to doubt or to fear—then you will help to make America great again. You will be proud of yourself, be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. And never, ever forget, America is proud of you.\nThis is a very, very special occasion for me. I've known so many Scouts over the years. Winners. I've known so many great people. They've been taught so well, and they love their heritage. But this is very special for me. And I just want to end by saying very importantly: God bless you, God bless the Boy Scouts, God bless the United States of America.\nGo out, have a great time in life, compete, and go out and show me that there is nobody—nobody—like a Boy Scout. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-07-24", "title": "Remarks at the National Scout Jamboree in Glen Jean, West Virginia"}

Thank you very much. Please. I'm very happy to announce that, with zero of the Democrats' votes, the motion to proceed on health care has just passed, and now we move forward towards truly great health care for the American people. We look forward to that. This was a big step.\nI want to thank Senator John McCain, very brave man. He made a tough trip to get here and vote. So we want to thank Senator McCain and all of the Republicans. We passed it without one Democrat vote. And that's a shame, but that's the way it is, and it's very unfortunate.\nBut I want to congratulate American people because we're going to give you great health care. And we're going to get rid of Obamacare which should have been, frankly, terminated long ago. It's been a disaster for the American people.\nThank you very much.\nGood afternoon and thank you all for being here. It is my honor to welcome Prime Minister Sa'ad Hariri of Lebanon to the White House.\nThe Prime Minister and I have just concluded an extensive conversation about the challenges and opportunities facing Lebanon and its neighbors. Lebanon is on the frontlines in the fight against ISIS, Al Qaida, and Hizballah. The Lebanese people, of all faiths, are working together to keep their country—and you know this, and we've been discussing this at great length—their country safe and prosperous. They love their country, and they're going to keep it safe and prosperous.\nMr. Prime Minister, I want to commend you and your people for standing up for humanity in a very troubled part of the world. The ties between our two countries stretch back more than a century. Long, long relationships.\nIn 1866, American missionaries founded the American University of Beirut. Now, more than 150 years later—and with ongoing American support—this university continues to educate generations of leaders in the region.\nToday, our two countries seek to strengthen our relationship in many ways, including the pursuit of stability, mutual prosperity, and peace. What the Lebanese Armed Forces have accomplished in recent years is very impressive. In 2014, when ISIS tried to invade northern Lebanon, the Lebanese Army beat them back. Since that time, the Lebanese Army has been fighting continually to guard Lebanon's border and prevent ISIS and other terrorists—of which there are many—from gaining a foothold inside their country.\nThe United States military has been proud to help in that fight and will continue to do so. America's assistance can help ensure that the Lebanese Army is the only defender Lebanon needs. It's a very effective fighting force.\nThreats to the Lebanese people come from inside as well. Hizballah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people, and the entire region. The group continues to increase its military arsenal, which threatens to start yet another conflict with Israel. Constantly fighting them back.\nWith the support of Iran, the organization is also fueling the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. Hizballah likes to portray itself as a defender of Lebanese interests, but it's very clear that its true interests are those of itself and its sponsor, Iran.\nI have repeatedly emphasized that Syria's neighbors in the Middle East must take responsibility for helping Syrian refugees until they can return home and rebuild their country. The Lebanese people have led the way, accepting more Syrian refugees per capita than any other nation. It's not even close.\nI want to thank the Prime Minister and the Lebanese people for giving shelter to those victimized by ISIS, the Asad regime, and their supporters and sponsors, and pledge our continued support to Lebanon.\nSince the start of the Syrian crisis, the United States has helped Lebanon support Syrian refugees with clean water, food, shelter, and health care. Our approach—supporting the humanitarian needs of displaced Syrian citizens as close to their home country as possible—is the best way to help most people. America is proud to stand with those who have the courage to stand up to terrorism and take responsibility for affairs in their own region.\nThe reliance and resilience of the Lebanese people in the face of war and terror is extraordinary. We honor the citizens of Lebanon who are working to secure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for their children.\nMr. Prime Minister, I'm grateful that you're here today. It's a big day in our country because of the vote that you just heard about. [Laughter] We stood and watched the results on television before coming out, and you found it very interesting, I hope——\nPrime Minister Hariri. Yes, I did.\nPresident Trump. ——and very important. I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and the enduring friendship between the American and Lebanese peoples.\nThank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister.\nPrime Minister Hariri. Thank you. Good afternoon. I had the honor and pleasure—and the pleasure to hold a very good meeting with President Trump. I appreciate his leadership and the United States leadership in the world today. We discussed the situation in our region and the efforts we, in Lebanon, are making to safeguard our political and economic stability, while combating terrorism.\nI thanked President Trump for his support to our army and security agencies, as well as his support to UNIFIL maintaining peace and stability along our southern border, where our government is committed to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, as well as all resolutions.\nWe also discussed the pressures Lebanon is facing as a result of 1.5 million Syrians displaced in our country. I outlined to the President Trump my government's vision for dealing with this crisis with the support of the international community. We also discussed economic prospects in Lebanon and our government's effort to jumpstart inclusive economic growth with a particular emphasis on job creation. I thank President Trump and the United States of America for their support to the Lebanese people, striving to keep their country a model of moderation, dialogue, coexistence, and democratic governance in our region.\nThank you.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much.\nMargaret Talev [Bloomberg News], please.\nQ. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Hello, Margaret.\nAttorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III\nQ. Hi. Hi, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, I'll have a question for you also in just a second, if you'll bear with me.\nYou spoke earlier today to the Wall Street Journal—we've all seen those comments—but I think everybody here probably is hoping that you could talk a little bit more about this. You have called your Attorney General \"beleaguered.\" You've criticized his decision to recuse himself on the Russia matters. And your, kind of, catchphrase or motto before the White House was, \"You're fired.\" So I'm wondering if you would talk to us a little bit about whether you've lost confidence in Jeff Sessions, whether you want him to resign on his own, whether you're prepared to fire him if he doesn't, and why you're, sort of, letting him twist in the wind rather than just making the call for him. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Well, I don't think I am doing that, but I am disappointed in the Attorney General. He should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office. And if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else. So I think that's a bad thing not for the President, but for the Presidency. I think it's unfair to the Presidency. And that's the way I feel. Thank you.\nQ. Thank you. Mr. Prime Minister, could you tell us what you think about the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar? This is something that has been of great concern to the U.S. also in terms of resolving. Do you think that Qatar is doing enough on terror? And if so, would you like to see President Trump increase the pressure on the Saudi coalition to ease its blockade?\nAnd, Mr. President, if you would give us any more of your thinking on, going forward, the path with Attorney General Sessions, and maybe your timeline for making a decision, that would be great. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. You don't give up. That's okay. [Laughter]\nPrime Minister Hariri. Thank you. I think there is an effort by the Kuwaitis. They're leading this effort. I think—and I think they made some progress. We believe that dialogue is the best way in improving this relationship between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. I believe that maybe the United States also could help in this—in solving this issue in the Gulf.\nDenise [Denise Rahme Fakhry, MTV Lebanon].\nSyria/Hizballah Political-Paramilitary Organization Q. I have one question for the President and also for Prime Minister. Congress introduced additional sanctions against Hizballah last week. What is your position towards these sanctions and on the role of Hizballah is playing in the region and Syria?\nPresident Trump. I'll be making my position very clear over the next 24 hours. We're going to see what is exactly taking place. I have meetings with some of my very expert military representatives and others, so I'll be making that decision very shortly. Okay? Thank you.\nQ. And about his role in Syria and the region?\nPresident Trump. Whose role?\nQ. Hizballah's role.\nPresident Trump. I'll be talking about that tomorrow.\nQ. Prime Minister——\n[At this point, the reporter asked a question and Prime Minister Hariri responded in Arabic, and no translation was provided. President Trump then spoke as follows.]\nPresident Trump. Blake Burman [Fox Business Network]. Thank you. Hello, Blake.\nAttorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III/Leaking of Information by U.S. Intelligence Agencies/Health Care Reform Legislation\nQ. President Trump, hello. Thank you. Indulge us here for a second. Just to pick up where Margaret left off, the American people, I think, would like to know: Do you feel that the Attorney General should indeed stay? Should he resign? Do you intend on firing him? Why should he remain as the Attorney General?\nAnd secondly, on a separate topic, with the health care vote that just came about, there is a still long ways to go. At what point do you feel that Republicans, if they can't get something done, should just say, you know what, we gave it a go, let's move on to tax reform instead? Thank you.\nPresident Trump. I want the Attorney General to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before, at a very important level. These are intelligence agencies. We cannot have that happen. You know many of my views in addition to that, but I think that's one of the very important things that they have to get on with.\nI told you before, I'm very disappointed with the Attorney General, but we will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell.\nOn health care, I'm extremely happy that we got this vote. This is—they say, if you look historically, this is the tough vote to get. Now, we're all going to sit together, and we're going to try and come up with something that's really spectacular. We have a lot of options and a lot of great options. And the Republican Senators really went out there. It's not easy when you have 52 Senators and you have a bloc of 48 voting against you. No matter what it is, no matter how good it sounds, it's very hard to get the kind of numbers that we got. We ended up with 51 votes—51 to whatever. I don't know what it is. Yes, 51 to 50.\nSo we had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think. It's very, very sad for them. But I'm very, very happy with the result. I believe now we will, over the next week or two, come up with a plan that's going to be really, really wonderful for the American people.\nObamacare is a disaster. It's failing on every front. It's too expensive. It gives horrible coverage. It was gotten by a lie, 28 times. It was a lie. You can keep your doctor; you can keep your plan—all lies. And the people are sick of it. And we're going to come up with a great health care that satisfies the needs of the people that we serve, which is the people of the United States.\nI will say—and I said it right at the beginning—health care is always difficult, because you have to weed a very, very narrow path, like a quarter of an inch wide, right down the middle. And if you go a little bit too far right, you lose three people on the left. And if you go a little bit too far left, you lose five people on the right. It is a very, very complex and difficult task, but it's something I actually know quite a bit about. I want to just thank some of the Republican Senators, who were really fantastic in getting us here, in particular John McCain for making the trip.\nBut I think you're going to have a great health care. This is the beginning of the end for the disaster known as Obamacare.\nThank you very much.\nQ. And Mr. President——\nPrime Minister Hariri. [Inaudible]\nSyrian Refugees/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/Syria\nQ. Mr. President, how can the United States help Lebanon cope with the massive number of refugees—of Syrian refugees? And is there a way you can help facilitate the refugees' return to their home country?\nPresident Trump. Well, we are helping. And one of the things that we have made tremendous strides at is getting rid of ISIS. We have generals that don't like to talk; they like to do. And we were with General Mattis last night, and the success they've had against ISIS is extraordinary. We've made more progress in the last 4 or 5 months than previous—really, I could say, the previous administration made in 8 years.\nAnd then, we have to see what we have to see. But I will tell you, ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, ISIS in other locations—we have made tremendous strides. Our military is an incredible fighting force. And as you know, I let the commanders on the ground do what they had to do. Before, they used to have to call in this beautiful house and speak to people that didn't know what was happening: where they were; what locations; practically, probably never heard of the countries they were talking about or the towns. I let the generals do what they had to do. And we have made tremendous plans. We were discussing it just before. We have made tremendous gains with respect to ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and other places.\nPrime Minister Hariri. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nQ. What about Bashar al-Asad? What about Bashar al-Asad in Syria?\nPresident Trump. Asad?\nQ. Asad. President Trump. I'm not a fan of Asad, okay? [Laughter] He will tell you that, because we hit 58 out of 58, or you could even say, 59 out of 59, when we launched the Tomahawk missiles.\nNo, I am not a fan of Asad. I certainly think that what he's done to that country and to humanity is horrible, so I have been saying that for a long time. I am not somebody that will stand by and let him get away with what he tried to do. And he did it a number of times when President Obama drew the red line in the sand. And then he should have crossed that red line, because some horrible acts against humanity took place, including gas and the killing through gases. That was a bad day for this country. And I'd go a step further that, had President Obama gone across that line and done what he should have done, I don't believe you'd have Russia and I don't believe you'd have Iran to anywhere near the extent, and maybe not at all, in Syria today. Okay?\nThank you very much.\nQ. Mr. President——\n[Prime Minister Hariri had an exchange with reporters in Arabic, and no translation was provided. President Trump then spoke as follows.]\nQ. Mr. President, please, please.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nPrime Minister Hariri. Thank you so much.\nPresident Trump.

The ADA's recognition of the inherent dignity of disabled persons solidified America's status as the world leader in protecting fundamental rights. Today, we pay special respect to the contributions of the more than 56 million Americans living with disabilities, and we look forward to further advancing accessibility for all those who need it.\nPresident George H.W. Bush signed the ADA on July 26, 1990, and for 27 years it has been instrumental in protecting the rights and liberties of people with disabilities and strengthening their access to everyday American life. Disabilities are an unavoidable part of the human experience—veterans injured in service to their Nation, survivors of accidents and illnesses, children born with disabilities, and our elderly. Since its inception, the ADA has helped empower people living with disabilities by ensuring they have fair and just access to employment, government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and public transportation.\nAmericans are justifiably proud of the ADA and its accomplishments, but more can be done to protect the rights and dignity of Americans living with disabilities. Disabled Americans in the workforce already contribute substantially to our Nation's productivity and prosperity. We must continue to empower them by breaking down obstacles that prevent their full participation in the public and economic affairs of our Nation. In addition, my Administration will encourage American ingenuity and technological advancements in medicine and science, which will give millions of Americans with disabilities opportunities to work, engage in commerce, and connect with others in ways we could not have imagined 27 years ago.\nOn the anniversary of the ADA, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering an environment that provides all Americans with the opportunity to pursue their American dream. Let us all take this time to refocus our efforts to support our fellow Americans and help them succeed, no matter the obstacles they may face.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2017, as a day in celebration of the 27th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that celebrate the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to renew our commitment to achieving the promise of our freedom for all Americans.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

Look at all those cameras back there. Isn't that nice? [Laughter] We love Ohio. Boy, do we love Ohio.\nAudience member. Ohio loves you!\nThe President. Thank you. I'm going to be speaking about you in a couple of minutes. You are something. You are brave and strong, and we're going to be talking about you. And that's why we're here, to talk about you. So thank you very much.\nAustintown, OH, resident Robert M. Bishop. Thank you.\nThe President. And thank you, Secretary Shulkin, for the introduction—a special guy. And he's doing a tremendous job in leadership of the VA. He's working every day to keep our promise to take care of our great veterans.\nNow, I went all over Ohio, but I went all over almost every State, and the veterans were a very, very big topic for me. You know that. And I think what we're doing, it's never been done before. We just had a bill, the VA accountability bill. They've been trying to get it for many, many decades. They were unable to get it, and we got it. That means people are accountable. That means people are accountable for taking care of our vets. And if they don't take proper care, we hold them accountable. So I think it's just great.\nSo, Secretary, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nI also want to recognize two veterans here with us who now serve the American people as members of our Cabinet—Secretary Zinke and Secretary Perry. And we're going to be a net exporter of energy very shortly. Where is our—Perry, man, come here.\nSecretary of Energy J. Richard Perry. Hoorah! You'd better believe it, sir.\nThe President. And Secretary of the Interior controls about, what, 22 percent of the entire United States. So when somebody thinks they're big landlords, they're actually very small compared to him. [Laughter]\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan K. Zinke. He's in real estate. He knows. [Laughter]\nThe President. It's great to be back in Youngstown. It was a incredible time we had. And you know the numbers, and you saw for many, many years Democrats—and they're really great—but Democrats, they win in Youngstown. But not this time. [Laughter] Right? They started to get a little nervous at the beginning of that evening when they see Youngstown seems to be going the other way. That hasn't happened in a lot of decades.\nAnd I hear we're doing better in the polls, even right now, than we were even on election night, in so many different places—swing States, et cetera—because they see what we're doing with jobs. The jobs are the best they've been in 17 years. The stock market hit another alltime high today. We're doing trade deals. And you know, we have statutory length problems where you have to wait statutorily before you do them. But everybody has been put on notice.\nWe're renegotiating NAFTA. And if we don't get the deal we want, we'll terminate NAFTA. NAFTA has been a disaster for Youngstown. It's been a disaster for Ohio. And people are coming back, if you look at Ohio. But if you look at Michigan and other places—auto industry is starting to come back in a very, very big way. You see what's happening with coal. Coal is coming—clean coal. We love clean coal. And it's coming back.\nI especially want to thank John and Jan Brown whose leadership in AMVETS has improved the lives of so many. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, John. Thank you, Jan. And they were with us right from the beginning, first time I was here. First time. Been—we really appreciate it, Jan. Thank you very much. Is he a good husband? Or just average? [Laughter]\nAMVETS Post 44 Commander Jan C. Brown. [Inaudible]\nThe President. I know he is.\nTo all the veterans with us this evening, we're here to honor you, to celebrate your service, and to thank you for your sacrifice. A grateful nation salutes you. And that's from the bottom of the President's heart: A truly grateful nation salutes you.\nAll week at the White House, we are celebrating American heroes. And nothing fills our hearts with more pride than to be with those who risked everything to protect our citizens and preserve our way of life.\nThis evening we're joined by veterans from every major engagement since World War II. You have crossed oceans, trekked deserts, scaled mountains, and cut your way through jungles to secure our Nation and defend our people. And nobody—throughout history, nobody—has done it better than you.\nYou gave all that you have for our country and for victory. We love victory, don't we?\nAudience members. Yes! Amen!\nThe President. We haven't had enough victory, but we're having it now. You're seeing it. We're having it now. You carried out your duty with honor, courage, and devotion. And with your sacrifice, you earned our freedom. In my administration, we will always protect those who protect us. Believe me, we will protect you because you have protected us.\nAudience member. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I tell you, thank you very much. That includes reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs—where David is doing such an incredible job—so we can serve you as faithfully as you served our Nation.\nSince my first day in office, we've taken one action after another to make sure that our veterans get the care they so richly deserve. We've begun to process a—seamlessly transferring veterans' medical records. Horrible situation, where you couldn't get your medical records. And now it's so easy and so good. And the system is fixed, finally, after all of these years. Right?\nWe've published wait times at every VA facility. I used to go around and talk about the veterans, and they'd stand on line for 9 days, 7 days, 4 days—that was a good one—15 days. People that could have been given a prescription and been better right away end up dying waiting on line. That's not happening anymore.\nAnd we have choice. If that happens, you're going to go out to the doctor. We're going to have choice, David. And it seems so obvious to me. Even before I really got into the nitty-gritty of the VA, it just seemed like—why would this great veteran, who protected us, stand on line for days and days and days and wait for a simple solution where it became a big problem because of those time delays? And we are now doing choice. And you go out, and you take care of it with a great doctor. Hopefully, you have a great doctor. If he's not so good, you get another one, right? [Laughter]\nWe've delivered same-day mental health service at every VA medical center. And so many of the veterans would come up to me during the campaign, and they really stressed how important the mental health aspect of what we're doing is.\nWe have nearly doubled the number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice. So not only is it choice, but we've doubled up, and now we're going to be tripling up very shortly.\nAnd so importantly, I have signed new historic legislation to ensure that every single Federal VA worker has to do what they have to do. They're going to be held accountable.\nAnd—[applause]—the pushback on that bill was unbelievable. I said to myself, oh, that should be easy. And then, I looked at 40 years of turmoil trying to get it through. And we won't attack any particular group, but you understand why it was not easy to get through. [Laughter] Because some people didn't want that. They wanted it to be that certain workers could do a horrible job. And most of the workers are great. And the doctors—a lot of the doctors in the VA are phenomenal talents—phenomenal. But now we're going to be able to get to those doctors.\nYou've put America first every day of your lives, and now we have a VA that will truly put veterans first—veterans. Your stories are America's stories, and your names are the names of true American heroes. I'd like to honor one such hero who is with us tonight: Robert M. Bishop. He looks good. [Laughter]\nNearly 76 years ago, Bob was a gunner aboard the USS Tennessee in Pearl Harbor, when the Japanese bombs struck the turrets of that once-great ship. During the attack, Bob was below the deck at his battle station for 4 excruciating hours of fire and hell. Five of his crewmembers never made it off the ship, giving their last breath in this courageous and incredible service to our country.\nBob stayed with his ship after the attack. And once it was repaired—which went, actually, much faster than it goes today, folks—you'll have to explain that one. [Laughter]\nAudience member. And it cost less.\nThe President. We—it cost a lot less too. [Laughter] He served on the Tennessee for another 4½ years, fighting in some of the greatest engagements in the Pacific Ocean.\nAfter World War II, Bob and his wife Doris moved back to Ohio. Good choice, Bob. [Laughter] That is a good choice. I love this State. Remember at the beginning, they always said, there is no victory without Ohio. Right, Mr. Chairman? Boy, did we win Ohio. Right? Remember? And it wasn't like it was close. That was a—that was a big one.\nAudience member. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Where Bob served in the Navy Reserve and also worked in the steel industry for over 50 years. This year, Bob and Doris celebrated—now, you're going to have to explain this to me—their 74th wedding anniversary. Wow. That is fantastic. That is so beautiful.\nHe's been back to Pearl Harbor eight times to pay tribute to his comrades. And it is with his—really, this great wish of his and the great wish of so many people that know Bob, that he will attend the 80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor on the eve of his 101st birthday. And if your party gets—[applause]. And Bob, if your party gets a little bit cheap with the money—[laughter]—I'll pay for it, okay? Right? Right?\nSo, Bob, the depth of your love for the country, you really inspire us all. Today I'm truly honored to present you with a certificate of recognition for your heroic sacrifice, your lifetime of service, and your undying devotion to our great Nation. Thank you, Bob.\nWhere is that beautiful certificate?\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Mr. President.\nThe President. Oh, nice frame. [Laughter] They never give me frames. They just give me the paper. I have to go out and get my own frame. [Laughter] It's never great. Thank you, Bob. Thank you. Congratulations.\nTo every veteran here this evening, your courage is the strength of our Nation, and your patriotism is the beating heart of our shared destiny. Your stories will inspire generations of Americans to fight and to win for our country and for our great, beautiful American flag that we all honor.\nMay God bless you, may God bless our veterans, and may God bless the United States of America. And thank you very much, it's such an honor to be with you again. You are special people in a special State. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-07-25", "title": "Remarks in Struthers, Ohio"}

It's that time again, as many of you have probably noticed and I know several of you have asked about, for us to announce where the President will be donating his quarterly salary.\nLast quarter, the President's salary went toward the restoration of two projects at a national battlefield. After his donation, additional donors quickly stepped up to bring the total gift to over $260,000.\nIn this quarter, the President will be donating his salary to the Department of Education. And with that, I would like to bring up Secretary DeVos to tell you about what the department will be doing with the President's money to help equip the boys and girls who will be the leaders of tomorrow.\nSecretary DeVos, it's my pleasure, on behalf of the President of the United States, to present a check for $100,000 to the Department of Education.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: Well, thank you so much, Sarah. I want to start by saying how grateful I am to the President for this generous gift. The President is committed to our nation's students and to reforming education in America so that every child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a high-quality education.\nHe and I have had many conversations about how best to put students' needs first, and ensure we are setting them up for a lifetime of success. There's much work to be done, but we are certainly on the right track thanks to the President's leadership.\nJust yesterday, Ivanka Trump and I hosted a summer reading event at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, where the focus was on getting young girls, age six to ten, excited about learning science, technology, engineering, and math. It was fun to see their eyes light up as they got to explore, create, and experiment in a collaborative environment.\nToday's and tomorrow's economy requires students prepared for STEM careers. That's why we've decided to use the President's second-quarter salary to host a STEM-focused camp for students at the Department of Education. We want to encourage as many children as possible to explore STEM fields in the hope that many develop a passion for these fields.\nWe look forward to this exciting endeavor, and I thank President Trump again for this generous gift. Thanks.\nMR. SANDERS: Thank you, Secretary DeVos. Thank you for coming and being here for that today.\nNow, I know Anthony is probably a little bit disappointed that he's not up here today, but since he did some TV this morning, he was able to go ahead and get his hair and makeup done, so I think he'll be okay. (Laughter.)\nAs Anthony said when he was up here last week, we're looking to mix things up a little bit. From time to time, I'd like to give us all a little reminder of why we're here every day, which I imagine for most of us is because we love our country and want to help to make it better.\nI've spent quite a bit of time around the President over the last year and I know exactly why he's here. He's tough, he's a fighter, he's a strong leader, and he's somebody who deeply loves this country. And he loves its people and he wants to make America great again.\nIn Washington, it's often easy to go to work, get lost in the process, and forget why we're here every day. The reason we're here is to serve the American people. And today I'd like for you to indulge me and let me tell you a little bit about what that means for me.\nTo the best of my knowledge, I'm the first mom to hold the job of the White House Press Secretary. That says less about me than it does about this President. It's not just with personnel, it's about people and it's about policy. Empowering working moms is at the heart of the President's agenda, particularly when it comes to things like tax reform.\nI have three children, and the oldest, Scarlett, starts kindergarten in a few weeks. Scarlett and every little girl in America should grow up in a country that if we deliver on the President's agenda of better jobs, better healthcare, and a better tax system, that incentivizes women to work and raise children.\nAs a working mom, it's not lost on me what a great honor and what a privilege it is to stand here at the podium, and I thank the President for the opportunity. I'll always do my absolute best to truthfully answer your questions and to deliver the President's message.\nJonathan, I preempt you from asking that question later. (Laughter.)\nBut I also hope to send my daughter a message and to every other kid in America: Don't listen to the critics, dream big, and fulfill your potential -- because in this country, you still can.\nTo remind us a little bit more often about some of the forgotten men, women, and children that we're here to serve and that the President is fighting for, we're going to start the White House briefing every once in a while with a letter or an email that we may receive from some of those individuals.\nTo kick it off with that process, I'd like to read you a letter from 9-year-old Dylan:\n\"My name is Dylan Harbin, but everybody calls me Pickle. I'm nine years old, and you're my favorite President. I like you so much that I had a birthday about you. My cake was the shape of your hat.\"\nAnd then Dylan goes on to ask a few questions: \"How old are you?\" Dylan, President Trump is 71 years old. \"How big is the White House?\" The White House is 168 feet long, it's 70 feet tall on the south side, and 60 feet, four inches tall on the north, and it takes 300 gallons of white paint to cover the exterior of the White House residence. It has 132 rooms and approximately 55,000 square feet. \"How much money do you have?\" Dylan, I'm not sure, but I know it's a lot.\n\"I don't know why people don't like you.\" Me either, Dylan. \"You seem really nice. Can we be friends?\" I'm happy to say that I directly spoke to the President, Dylan, and he would be more than happy to be your friend. \"My picture is in here. So, if you can, see me and say hello.\" Dylan, I hope you're watching, because the President wanted me to personally tell you hello. \"Your friend, Dylan.\"\nDylan, thanks for writing to the President. And if you're ever in Washington, D.C., I hope you'll stop by and let us show you around the White House.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nSteve.\nQ: Sarah, Jeff Sessions was here today. What was he doing here? Did he meet with the President? And what does the President think about the conservatives who are rallying behind Jeff Sessions, saying he's essential to staying in his office?\nMS. SANDERS: The Attorney General was here for other meetings, not with the President -- it was a principals committee meeting -- and did not see the President while he was here.\nI think the President has been very clear about where he is. He's obviously disappointed but also wants the Attorney General to continue to focus on the things that the Attorney General does. He wants him to lead the Department of Justice. He wants to do that strongly. He wants him to focus on things like immigration, leaks, and a number of other issues, and I think that's what his focus is at this point.\nQ: Can I just follow up? If the Attorney General launches a leak probe, would that help his status with the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that's the nature of the relationship. Again, I think that the President is disappointed. He stated that, and I don't think there's anything more to add beyond that at this point.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. A couple questions about the new policy on transgender servicemembers the President announced this morning. First, what happens to transgender servicemembers now? Are you they immediately thrown out of the military?\nMS. SANDERS: That's something that the Department of Defense and the White House will have to work together as implementation takes place and is done so lawfully.\nQ: So it's possible -- because I see the President was pretty clear in his tweet that transgender individuals -- he will not accept or allow a transgender individual to serve in any capacity. So does that mean that those that are now in theater, that are now deployed to Afghanistan, for example, will have to be immediately sent home and discharged?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, implementation policy is going to be something that the White House and the Department of Defense have to work together to lawfully determine, and I would imagine the Department of Defense will be the lead on that and keep you posted as that takes place.\nQ: Why did he decide to do this given that during the campaign he had declared that he would protect the rights of transgender individuals? He said he would be better on this issue than Hillary Clinton, and now he's turned the clock back on this issue regarding the military.\nMS. SANDERS: The President has a lot of support for all Americans and certainly wants to protect all Americans at all times. The President has expressed concerns since this Obama policy came into effect, but he's also voiced that this is a very expensive and disruptive policy. And based on consultation that he's had with his national security team, came to conclusion that it erodes military readiness and unit cohesion, and made the decision based on that.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. If I could follow up on what Jonathan just said, the President actually tweeted, \"Thank you to the LGBT community. I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.\" And so I'm wondering, you said the policy -- the President in general wants to protect all Americans. Does this shift in policy protect transgender Americans? And what is the message that he is attempting to send to them by making this shift in policy?\nAnd if I could follow on that, healthcare --\nMS. SANDERS: Let me answer that first, and then we'll come back to healthcare.\nQ: Sure, sure.\nMS. SANDERS: On that, the decision is based on a military decision. It's not meant to be anything more than that, and it's simply about -- obviously it's a very difficult decision. It's not a simple one, but the President feels that it's the best one for the military.\nQ: Okay, on healthcare, then, if I could follow really quickly. Can you repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and still protect Medicaid funding? We're talking about the most dependent among us, and the need for Medicaid is great. And that seems to be a major concern among some lawmakers, including Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski. So I'm wondering, from the President's perspective, if congressional lawmakers do send him a repeal that does not protect Medicaid funding, is that something he would still support? And what is he doing to try to protect Medicaid as it is now?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has been clear that he wants to protect those that are part of that program but also very focused on repealing and replacing. We're working through that process. Excited about the progress that was made yesterday, and we're going to continue pushing forward until we get a new and better healthcare plan.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. One short thing and then questions. Can you provide us with a copy of the letter that you read, and even hold it up, or distribute a copy to us?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. I'll be happy to.\nQ: That would be wonderful.\nMS. SANDERS: I'll knock out Dylan's name -- last name.\nQ: Yes, thank you.\nBut back on Attorney General Jeff Sessions. You said that he didn't meet with the President when he was at the White House this week. Has he spoken to the President this week? Do you know when the last time the two of them spoke was?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't believe they've spoken this week. I'm not sure on the timeframe.\nQ: Okay. And then another follow-up on Jeff Sessions.\nMS. SANDERS: Always two.\nQ: You said that the President has been very clear about his position on Jeff Sessions, and yesterday the President said that he wasn't leaving him to \"twist in the wind.\" But he continued to tweet about him this morning. If he is so frustrated and so disappointed in him, why doesn't he just ask him to resign or fire him? Why does he continue to just tweet about him instead?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, you can be disappointed in someone but still want them to continue to do their job.\nQ: Does he want him to continue in that job?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that I made clear last week that if there comes a point he doesn't, he'll make that decision.\nBlake.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. Let me have you please clarify if you can some comments that the President made in the Wall Street Journal interview yesterday about tax reform. He said -- and I quote here -- \"The truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten,\" as he says, \"screwed. And if there's upward revision it's going to be on high-income people.\" On that upward revision part, what exactly was the President talking about? Is it a revision from his plan on the personal side of 35 percent, or is it reviving it up from the current tax code?\nMS. SANDERS: When we get ready to walk through the full details of the plan, I'm happy to do that at that time. But right now, we're focused on the three big priorities of the tax reform: a simple, fair tax code, middle class relief, and creating jobs. That's where we are right now. We're continuing to work through that process, and we'll make announcements as we have specifics.\nQ: Let me just ask you a more general question on that. Does the President believe that the wealthiest Americans deserve a tax cut?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President is looking and prioritizing middle-class tax relief. He's made no secret about that. That's one of the biggest priorities of the three things that he's focused on when it comes to tax reform.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Two questions for you. First, the President has had almost 24 hours to review the Russia sanctions legislation. Has he decided if he's going to sign that?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that. Senator Corker actually came out earlier today and said that he's not fully supportive of where the bill stands. We expect that there's a possibility that more changes take place. And so we're going to see what that looks like before we make a final decision.\nBut I can tell you that the White House, the President, and the entire administration -- as we've said many times before -- strongly support sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\nQ: My second question is, is the President considering looking at any kind of policy about transgender people serving in the White House now that he's tried to make a decision on transgender people serving in the military?\nMS. SANDERS: No. Once again, this was a decision based on what was best for the military and military cohesion, and on the counsel of his national security team.\nMajor.\nQ: So the impression that we get at the Pentagon is they were a little bit -- caught a little bit flat-footed by the President's tweets. As I understand it, this was and has been for the last couple of weeks a conversation here specifically about Tricare coverage for transgender procedures. And it suddenly evolved for the President to then go on Twitter to announce this ban. And as you already told us, the White House and the Pentagon are going to have to lawfully implement that.\nTypically, when you have an announcement of this magnitude, all of that work has been done at the procedural level between the bureaucracy of the Pentagon and the White House. Why wasn't any of that work done? And why was the Pentagon caught so surprised this morning by the President's tweets on it?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said before, that the President's national security team was part of this consultation. You mentioned yourself that there have been ongoing conversations --\nQ: Yeah, but the smaller issue, not a whole ban.\nMS. SANDERS: Right. When the President made the decision yesterday, the Secretary of Defense was immediately informed as were the rest of the national security team that had been part of this ongoing conversation.\nQ: But you can't answer the question of what's going to happen to transgenders who are in the military now. Shouldn't you have been able to answer that basic question for a policy of this magnitude?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think sometimes you have to make decisions. And once he made a decision, he didn't feel it was necessary to hold that decision. And they're going to work together with the Department of Defense to lawfully implement it.\nPeter.\nQ: Okay, one last thing on Sessions -- just because this is the baseline question. You said earlier the President was \"frustrated.\" Is that frustration now in the past? And does he fully have confidence in the Attorney General to carry out his duties from this day forward?\nMS. SANDERS: The President wants the Attorney General to focus on his duties as Attorney General. And I think we've both spoken about that pretty extensively, and I don't have anything else to add.\nPeter.\nQ: You just announced the President is donating his second-quarter salary of $100,000 to the Department of Education. So, clearly, he must care about education. Why then is he calling for $9.2 billion in spending cuts to the Department of Education in the next budget?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that oftentimes you have a lot of duplicative efforts, and they want to streamline the process. And we simply have a government that's completely out of control when it comes to spending. We have an outrageous deficit, and we're looking to make things so that we have a balanced budget in the next 10 years. The President campaigned on it, he's committed to seeing it through, but he's also committed to education, as you can see by his own personal commitment and looking for ways that we can save and continue on to make education better, passing some of the decision-making down to more local and state control, and something we're certainly supportive of.\nQ: Can I ask you then, quickly on transgender -- just a quick follow-up. In June of 2016, in the heat of the campaign, he wrote, \"Thank you to the LGBT community. I will fight for you.\" Did the President today just betray his commitment to the transgender community?\nMS. SANDERS: No. As I answered before, this was a decision about military readiness. And I've already answered even to that specific tweet.\nQ: But do you say to the transgender community that he is still committed to fight for them? And how is this not not fighting for them?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has made very clear he's committed to fighting for all Americans.\nQ: Is this fighting for all Americans?\nQ: Thank you very much, Sarah. Was this decision on transgenders in the military made to put pressure on Democrats running in 2018, particularly Democrats running in socially conservative districts like in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware.\nQ: And just to follow up on that, what is the timeline for when guidance will be delivered to the Pentagon on how the President's decision should be implemented?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll let you know when we have an announcement.\nPeter.\nQ: Sarah, the President said this morning -- or tweeted this morning, asking why the Attorney General has not fired Andrew McCabe as acting FBI Director. Why hasn't the President fired Andrew McCabe as acting FBI Director?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has made an incredible nominee in Chris Wray, and he's looking forward to getting him confirmed and taking over the FBI.\nQ: (Inaudible) fire him, why should Attorney General Sessions fire him?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, he's made a choice to lead that agency and we're looking forward to getting him confirmed soon.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, two questions. One following up on Major with Tricare and the transgender community. There's been a concern from the transgender community before President Trump became President Trump that, if Obamacare changed to Trumpcare, they were wondering if they were able to get the procedures to help them complete their phases of becoming the other sex, or the other gender.\nWhat do you say to those people who are seeing this now with this ban in the military? What do you say to transgender America who wants to continue with the change? Maybe some who already had part of the change and want to do the change and are scared because of what's happening now, not for certain. What do you say to transgender America?\nMS. SANDERS: As I've said before and I'll try to make this clear, this was a military decision. This was about military readiness, this was about unit cohesion, this was about resources within the military, and nothing more.\nGuys, I really don't have anything else to add on that topic. As I do, I'll keep you posted. But if those are the only questions we have, I'm going to call it a day. But if we have questions on other topics, I'll be happy to take --\nQ: I'm sorry, Sarah, I wanted to finish. Everyone had a second question. On the morale of the Cabinet, Anthony Scaramucci this morning on \"New Day\" said that the Cabinet Secretaries need to have tough skin.\nHow is the President working with the Cabinet Secretaries right now? How does he build their morale after all of this with Sessions and we're hearing things coming out of State with Rex Tillerson? How is the President working on their morale?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the same way he works with all of us; he empowers us to do our jobs. And I don't think it matters whether you're a Cabinet Secretary or a low-level staffer. We're here to do a job. He's asked us to do it, and he expects us to get it done.\nAnd I've spent a good bit of time with quite a few Cabinet Secretaries over the last couple days, and morale is high.\nStephen.\nQ: One more point about transgender servicemembers not here in this country, but overseas. And there are 18 countries where transgender servicemembers are allowed to serve openly. The U.K. is one. Australia is another. Israel is a third. The President in his tweet this morning referred to disruptions. What does he mean? And is he concerned that there are disruptions in our allies' militaries in Australia and the U.K. and Israel? And should we worry about that from the military standpoint?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said earlier, this decision was made after extensive discussions with his national security team, and the President decided it was in the best interest of the military to end this Obama policy.\nI can't speak to anything about another country. Pretty focused on making sure we get good things happening here.\nZeke.\nQ: Sarah, you were talking earlier about what the President wishes Attorney General Sessions to be doing in his job right now. Why hasn't the President picked up the phone or invited him over into the Oval Office? Does the President have any intention of speaking with the Attorney General this week?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll keep you posted if he does.\nJohn.\nQ: Sorry. Second question on the transgender servicemember issue. You mentioned that the President reached his decision to improve or maintain unit cohesion. How does it maintain or improve unit cohesion to leave thousands of servicemembers, some who may be overseas, serving in units overseas, in the dark about their status within the military?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, this was a decision made after the consultation with his national security team and decided the best decision.\nAlex.\nQ: I want to ask you about a tweet the President had on Sunday. He said, \"It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect the President.\" Which Republicans was the President talking about? And what would he like to see from them? What sort of protection?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to call out any senators by name up here today. But I think the President is very committed to a robust agenda and changing America for the better. And Republicans have both the House and Senate -- he's hoping they'll join him in pushing forward a lot of the policies that most of those people campaigned on, like repealing and replacing Obamacare. I think that's a perfect example of Republicans needing to step up to commitments that they made during the campaign and since being elected, and get those things done.\nGuys, I hate to cut it short. The President has got an event as I know you can all hear by all of the cheering children. I hope that we can join together in welcoming the boys and girls from the Girls Nation. Thanks, guys.\nEND 2:59 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-07-26", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

Hello, everybody.\nAudience members. Hello, Mr. President.\nThe President. We actually just met, for the audience. We just met. [Laughter] We took pictures, right?\nAudience members. Yes.\nThe President. That's right. Well, thank you very much. It's my great honor to officially welcome Boys and Girls Nation to the White House. Really special place, isn't it though? Isn't it great?\nAudience members. Yes.\nThe President. Great. And I want to congratulate you—what a job you've all done—basically on all you've achieved at a very young age. It's incredible. For decades, the American Legion has brought the best and brightest to the White House. This has taken place for many years.\nEach of you were chosen out of the many thousands of people, that—you know, they're all calling in, they want to get into the White House. Is anybody upset that you're here?\nAudience members. No.\nThe President. Okay, but you're all really happy that you're here, right?\nBut you represent your State, and that's a very, very important element too. And a very important factor in getting here. You all share incredible talent and drive. Most importantly, you have each other to really work with and to help. And you help each other, you're teammates, you love our country—that's something we all have in common, right? We love our country, right?\nWhile you come from all corners of our great landscape, you are all united by your devotion—total devotion—to our great American flag, our freedom, and the principles that bind us together as one people and one Nation. For more than a century, the American Legion has taught young citizens about the importance of patriotism and loyalty to our country. And through it all, there's nothing like what you're doing today and what you've achieved over a very, very short period of time. We want to thank you, and we want to thank the national chapters and everybody else.\nWe have to really give a special thanks to Commander Charles Schmidt. Where's Charles? Where is Charles? Come here, Charles. Come here, Charles. Come on up here, Charles. What a great job. Come on. You want to—see, he wants to give you all the credit. [Laughter] Who served in the Air Force for 28 years and now advances the Legion's proud legacy. Thank you, Charles.\nToday we are joined by President of the American Legion and Auxiliary Mary Davis. Where is Mary? Where is Mary? Hello, Mary. You want to come up here? Come on, Mary. And Executive Director—who I know—Verna Jones. Come on, Verna. Come on up. Come on up. Come on up, Mary. Be careful.\nI want to thank you for your commitment to these incredible students and to our country. Thank you.\nAmerican Legion Auxiliary National President Mary E. Davis. Thank you so much. I appreciate that.\nAmerican Legion Executive Director Verna Jones. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nThe President. Congratulations. I also want to honor former National Commander Bob Turner, who everyone really knows.\nAudience members. Bob! Bob! Bob!\nThe President. Wow. That's pretty good, Bob. [Laughter] That's as good as I've ever heard. [Laughter] That's fantastic. Come on over here, Bob. Be careful. We don't want to see Bob go down. Do you agree with that? [Laughter] Because he will never forget that. Come on, Bob.\nAmerican Legion Director of Activities and Former National Commander Bob Turner. I've got it.\nThe President. Got it?\nMr. Turner. I've got it.\nThe President. This year, Bob is celebrating his 35th year helping to lead Boys Nation, all as a volunteer. Thank you very much, Bob. That's so great. And, Bob, I know everyone here today agrees when I say thousands of young Americans are better patriots because of your incredible and steadfast service. Right, fellas? Right?\nThrough this program, countless young people like you have been inspired to protect American interests and to promote American values. Right? Many of those who have been in your place have gone on to become Governors, Members of Congress, generals, and one even became a President. You know who that one was?\nAudience members. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Go ahead.\nAudience members. Bill Clinton.\nThe President. That's true. See? [Laughter]\nThe American Legion has held this meeting for seven decades. Just think of the history that has occurred during that time. When the first group of students met in 1946—oh, that's an important day, you know why? That's when I was born. [Laughter] I hate to admit it.\nMs. Davis. I'm 3 years younger.\nThe President. I hate to admit it. Oh, 1946. Oh, wow. [Laughter] I shouldn't have said that, Bob. You—[laughter].\nOur nation had just welcomed home our brave heroes whose spirit and courage achieved victory over tyranny in World War II. Just over 20 years later, young men and women like you watched a man land on the Moon and dreamed of new frontiers in space. In 1987, Americans all across this Nation joined their hearts with President Ronald Reagan in the hope, the prayer, and the conviction that the Berlin Wall would crumble in the face of truth, justice, and freedom. You know all about that.\nAudience members. Yes, sir.\nThe President. In each of these moments and so many others, America triumphed. We win. We know how to win, right? Does everybody know——\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And we win because of the spirit of our people. Believe me, that's a big part of it.\nJust think of the amazing moments in history you will witness during your lifetime. Well, you saw one on November 8, right? Huh?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. That was a pretty amazing moment we have—and we're doing a good job. Our country is doing so well now. We're doing a good job. You all happy?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Because you have what it takes to be the leaders that will shape this future. Some of you may want to come back to the Capital—someday, you're going to be back, many of you—and help make the laws that will guide this Nation and govern our land.\nOthers may choose to answer the call of duty, put on the uniform, and risk everything for our Nation and for our Nation's people. Still others may become business leaders, teachers, artists, and inventors. We have them all, and we have them all here today.\nAnd some of you don't even really know what it might be, but we have people that are going to be so successful, so incredible in their lives. And you're going to be happy. Do what you love. Do what you love. Follow what you love.\nSo I want to just tell—as you pour your whole heart into everything you do, really, you're doing it for your family, you're doing it for your country, but you're also doing it for yourselves. Because ultimately, you have to do it for yourself. It's better for your country, and your country wants you to succeed so much.\nBut there's no country like the United States of America, and there's no country that can give you the kind of opportunity that we give you in the United States.\nBeing successful is about finding your purpose in life and never ever giving up. Do you ever give up?\nAudience members. No, sir!\nThe President. No. Does anybody here give up?\nAudience members. No, sir!\nThe President. What about here?\nAudience members. No, sir!\nThe President. You're right. [Laughter] And I think they mean it. I think they mean it.\nMs. Jones. They mean it, sir. They mean it. The President. You were chosen for this program because you believe in America's future and because you have the ambition and the heart to ensure that America will always be victorious and will always prevail.\nThrough Boys and Girls Nation, you are learning the values that are necessary for a nation to endure and for a nation to thrive: pride in our history, loyalty to our citizens, and allegiance to our great American flag.\nIn the decades to come you will help our Nation reach new heights—we'll be so proud of you—discover new frontiers, and strengthen the bonds of loyalty between our country and its people.\nIt is my honor to meet with you all today, and it was my greater honor to come out here early before the press got here to take all of those pictures that we took, and I hope they send you the right pictures. [Laughter] And they will.\nAs I look out at the audience, I see the next generation of American leaders. I see the promise of our future. I see the strength and love of the American spirit. And because of young people like you, I am more confident than ever in the future of the United States.\nTogether, we will make America greater than ever before. I mean that. We're going to make America greater than ever before, and we're on our way. You see what's going on. We're building up military. We're getting great job numbers, best in 17 years. Best job numbers in 17 years. The enthusiasm for manufacturers and business is at just about the highest point since they started taking those tests.\nSo I just want to tell you, go out there. Go get them. I have no doubt you're going to—every one of you—be successful.\nNever quit. Never give up. Always do what you love. Take great care of your family and your parents, because we love your parents. [Laughter] You probably wouldn't be here without your parents, right? [Laughter]\nSo thank you again to the American Legion, and congratulations to you all. God bless you, and God bless America. And thank you for being at the White House. Thank you.\nQ. Mr. President, how did you decide your policy on transgender people in the military?\nAudience member. Get out of here.\nThe President. You go ahead. She's very rude.\n[At this point, Mr. Turner led participants in singing \"Show Your Colors, America\".]\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nAudience members. U.S.A.! [Laughter]\nThe President. You got the last word. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, everybody. Have a great life and love your country and love your God. Okay? Bye, everybody. Bye, everybody.

The company's initial investment of more than $10 billion will create 3,000 jobs at a minimum, with the potential for up to 13,000 jobs in the very near future. The construction of this facility represents the return of LCD electronics and electronic manufacturing to the United States, the country that we love. That's where we want our jobs.\nTo make such an incredible investment, Chairman Gou put his faith and confidence in the future of the American economy. In other words, if I didn't get elected, he definitely would not be spending $10 billion. [Laughter] His great company has seen our—you know, you see exactly what I'm saying—our administration's work to remove job-killing regulations. He's been watching, to institute \"buy American\" and \"hire American,\" and all of those policies, and to pursue the steps necessary to revitalize American industry, including repealing and replacing Obamacare. We better get that done, fellas, please. Mike, we need that so badly—cutting taxes, fixing our trade deals, and rebuilding our infrastructure. We'll be submitting an infrastructure bill in the not-very-distant future. We're going to be submitting a tax bill in the very near future. Right?\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Paul D. Ryan. Yes.\nThe President. When this investment is complete, Foxconn has the potential to create more manufacturing jobs than we've seen in many, many decades.\nChairman Gou, I thank you for your investment in the American worker. They appreciate it. They will not let you down. They never let us down. There is nobody like the American worker.\nTerry Gou told me that he believes in America—and he really believes in America—and that, as a great entrepreneur—one of the greatest in the world, by the way. He won't say it, but I'll say it: one of the great entrepreneurs of the world. He has a real bond with the administration and with Americans. Foxconn joins a growing list of industry leaders who understand that America's capabilities are limitless, and that America's workers are unmatched, and that America's most prosperous days are just ahead. We are going to have some very, very magnificent decades.\nThank you all for being here. Thank you, Terry. And thank you to Foxconn. God bless the United States of America. God bless you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-07-26", "title": "Remarks Announcing Foxconn Technology Group's Plans To Build a Manufacturing Facility in Wisconsin"}

We remember those who laid down their lives in defense of liberty, in a land far from home, and we vow to preserve their legacy.\nSituated between World War II and the Vietnam War, the Korean War has often been labeled as the \"Forgotten War,\" despite its having claimed the lives of more than 36,000 Americans. The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces, backed by the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea. Shortly thereafter, American troops arrived and pushed back the North Koreans. For 3 years, alongside fifteen allies and partners, we fought an unrelenting war of attrition. Through diplomatic engagements led by President Eisenhower, Americans secured peace on the Korean Peninsula. On July 27, 1953, North Korea, China, and the United Nations signed an armistice suspending all hostilities.\nWhile the armistice stopped the active fighting in the region, North Korea's ballistic and nuclear weapons programs continue to pose grave threats to the United States and our allies and partners. At this moment, more than 28,000 American troops maintain a strong allied presence along the 38th parallel, which separates North and South Korea. These troops, and the rest of our Armed Forces, help me fulfill my unwavering commitment as President to protecting Americans at home and to steadfastly defending our allies abroad.\nAs we reflect upon our values and pause to remember all those who fight and sacrifice to uphold them, we will never forget our Korean War veterans whose valiant efforts halted the spread of Communism and advanced the cause of freedom.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2017, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to our distinguished Korean War veterans.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

She is a great, great champion of small business. (Applause.) And I want to thank her for that warm and overly generous introduction and for her leadership of this great organization.\nAnd to be here today to be able to welcome all of you, welcome you to Washington, D.C., it is an honor to be with all of you, with the NFIB, a pillar of American opportunity and prosperity. (Applause.)\nThe National Federation of Independent Business has been such an extraordinary champion over the decades for small businesses and entrepreneurs across this country, and it's great to be able to address you today.\nAnd it's a particular honor for me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who himself is a businessman in an independent business who's fighting every day for job creators just like all of you -- the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President sent me here this morning to deliver a message but first and foremost to just to say thanks. With the strong support of small-business owners like you all across this country, President Trump last fall won a historic victory -- more counties than any President since Ronald Reagan; 30 of 50 states, states no Republican had actually carried in a generation. And the President and I could couldn't be more grateful for the men and women of the NFIB who stood with this President all along the way. Thank you for your support. (Applause.)\nAnd before I go any further, let me give you a quick update on one of the President's top promises and top priorities. As we speak, the President and I are pleased to report here in this building the United States Senate is moving forward on legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nAnd in the coming days, with the leadership of our President, the American people and American small businesses I believe will witness the beginning of the end of the Obamacare nightmare. (Applause.)\nI'll speak more about that -- I'll speak more about healthcare in just a few moments. But first, let me again give my thanks and admiration to all the members of the National Federation of Independent Business.\nNFIB is a titan of American excellence and entrepreneurship. For nearly 75 years, the NFIB has brought together American small businesses and given them a voice in the halls of government.\nToday those of you gathered in this auditorium at the United States Capitol represent a staggering 325,000 small businesses from every state in this country, and it's remarkable to think about the impact that each and every one of you have.\nYou create jobs. You provide a pathway of opportunity for generations of Americans. And you are literally the cornerstone of American communities from the smallest towns to the largest cities.\nPresident Trump probably said it best when he said that small businesses in his words, embody the American pioneering spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement every single day.\nAnd he couldn't be more right about small businesses in America. Give yourselves a round of applause for the difference that you make each and every day. (Applause.)\nI just had the joy of meeting with about 20 small businesses from my home state of Indiana, and it's great to see so many good friends here who I know make a tremendous difference back in the Hoosier State.\nNow they know that I actually grew up in a small family business in a small town in southern Indiana. I went to work at my dad's gas stations when I was only about 14 years of age. I know the sacrifices that small-business owners make, and I know that a small business is really all about family -- whether it's your immediate family, your extended family, or the family of your employees. And so I understand and appreciate the sacrifices and the unique joys of being involved in a small business.\nAnd as the world knows, President Trump grew up in a family business, too -- although his ended up to be a little bit bigger than my family's. (Laughter.)\nWe both know the sacrifices that are required, though, to make a business work. And more than that, President Trump and I know that when small business is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)\nWe both know small businesses are the engine of the American economy, and since day one of this administration, President Trump has been fighting to restart the engine of this economy and rev it up like never before.\nOur President has picked a world-class Cabinet full of entrepreneurs -- including the head of the Small Business Administration, Administrator Linda McMahon, who is an outstanding American success story. (Applause.)\nAnd with the support of his Cabinet and with the help of the Congress, President Trump has been busy rolling back the heavy hand of government on small business.\nI'm happy to report to you this President has actually signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.)\nThe legislation the President has already signed that Congress put on his desk is saving businesses like yours up to $18 billion a year in regulatory costs.\nIn fact, the President also instructed every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new federal red tape on America's job creators. (Applause.)\nAnd in case you didn't notice, the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States, and President Trump has already started to rebuild America. And we won't stop until America once again has the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports, and the best harbors, and the best future we could ever have. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump's leadership is already making a remarkable difference, too. Since Inauguration Day I'm pleased to report businesses like those gathered here today have created more than 850,000, new, good-paying jobs all across America. (Applause.)\nCompany after company are responding to the President's agenda with optimism and investment, like the historic investment that was made in an announcement yesterday at the White House alone by Foxconn, a company investing $10 billion in the heartland of America.\nAnd small businesses and manufacturers we're told haven't been this confident in a decade or more, and they should be -- because our President is a man of his word. He's a man of action. And under President Donald Trump, American small business is back and prosperity is here to stay! (Applause.)\nBut it has been a busy six months, but the President likes to say in the Oval Office, that's what we call just a good start. The truth is we got a lot more work to do. And as I said at the outset, in the coming days, President Trump, working with this Congress, is absolutely committed to rescue the American people from the disaster of Obamacare. (Applause.)\nWe all know the truth: Every day Obamacare survives is another day that American businesses and American families struggle.\nWe all remember the broken promises they made to get Obamacare passed. They said if you like your doctor you could keep them -- not true. They said if you liked your health insurance you could keep it -- not true. We were told the cost of health insurance would go down if Obamacare passed seven years ago -- that one is absolutely not true.\nIn fact, our administration has confirmed that the average premium on the individual market has more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect less than four years ago, and in many states, it's more than tripled.\nWhen Obamacare passed, we were actually promised that families would save up to $2,500 in premiums every year, but the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than a plan did in 2013. But I don't have to tell small-business owners about the struggle and the crisis in health insurance costs in America today.\nYou all know also that, while premiums are soaring, choices are plummeting. Next year, about 40 percent of America's counties, including nine whole states, will have only one choice of a health insurance provider, which means they have no choice at all.\nEven worse, dozens of counties will have no health insurance providers whatsoever on the Obamacare exchange in 2018. It's important to remember that while we think of these statistics and we reflect on them as policymakers, we're talking about real people facing a real crisis. You all know each and every day that behind every one of these numbers is a name, and behind every name is a story.\nAs I've traveled across the country on our President's behalf, I've heard firsthand from job creators and working families about the burden that Obamacare has placed -- the burden of higher costs, fewer choices, and worse care for people who need it.\nAs Juanita has pointed out, in her words, \"the high cost of healthcare has been the number one problem for small-business owners for 30 years.\" But as she noted, \"Obamacare turned that problem into a crisis.\"\nBut I want to tell you, Juanita, and to all those gathered here today: Help is on the way and it's coming soon. (Applause.)\nYou know I have heard this same thing from businesses I have talked to -- small businesses seeing premiums skyrocket by 25 percent or more every single year. I've heard from entrepreneurs who had to actually drop their health insurance because it's completely unaffordable. And that's a heartache for a small-business owner. You want to be able to provide health insurance and benefits for your employees, but you got to make ends meet. Sometimes you got to make those hard choices.\nWorst of all, I've heard from job creators who can't grow, and some who are even struggling to keep their doors open. The men and women of the National Federation of Independent Business know the truth: Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. And let me be clear: This is the moment. Now is the time.\nDespite the opposition of literally every single Democrat in both chambers of Congress, on Tuesday, I'm pleased to report the Senate voted, and I cast the tie-breaker to begin the debate to repeal and replace Obamacare. And the NFIB was there, helping to make it happen. (Applause.)\nLet me assure you, President Trump and our entire administration are literally working around the clock with Senate Republicans to finish what they started earlier this week. Throughout the rest of today and, I'm told, late into the hours of tonight, the Senate will continue debating proposals from Republicans and Democrats.\nAnd when it's all said, the world's greatest deliberative body, I believe, will vote on a bill to keep Republicans' promise to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nPresident Trump made it clear, in his words, just a few short days ago: \"Inaction is not an option.\" And as the President said this morning to Senate Republicans, after seven years, this is their chance to shine. They can't let the American people down.\nThe Senate has an opportunity and an obligation to rescue the American people from the consequences of this failed policy. And when the time comes, every single senator -- Republican and Democrat -- owes it to America to step up, to do the right thing. They owe it to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nAnd as is testament by your presence here today, the American people are watching. Because you all know what's at stake. What happens in the coming days will determine the future of American healthcare, and whether our leaders in Congress can demonstrate the courage and determination to keep their word.\nBut more than anything else, this will determine whether America still stands by principles that I believe are at the very heart of our experiment in self-government.\nYou know, for the past seven years, we've had a healthcare system based on the flawed premise that the federal government should order every American to buy health insurance, whether they want it or need it or not; that bureaucrats and politicians know better than patients and doctors; and that, worst of all, that the American people can't be trusted to run their own lives and make their own healthcare choices.\nWell, today -- literally today -- we have a chance to take a giant step toward restoring a healthcare system based on personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform. And I believe the Senate will take that step and will deliver for the American people on a foundation of freedom. (Applause.)\nThe President and I believe that the Senate will do the right thing, that they will begin to dismantle the failed policy of Obamacare in the coming days. And President Trump will sign into law, when it's all said and done, a bill that puts our country on a path to better, more affordable healthcare for all the American people -- based on those timeless principles of freedom, free-market competition, and state-based reform.\nAnd after that, I'll make you one more promise: Before the end of this year, we're going to roll up our sleeves, and this President is going to work with the Congress, and we're going to pass one of the largest tax cuts in American history. (Applause.)\nI don't have to tell small-business owners that the Americans' tax code is one of the biggest barriers to success for working families and small businesses like all of you gathered here today. You know, there's an old joke that says that the Internal Revenue Code is 10 times the length of the Bible, but with none of the good news. (Laughter.)\nWell, here's some real good news: We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. (Applause.) And we're going to simplify the tax code by cutting seven brackets down to three; we'll eliminate the alternative minimum tax. And under President Donald Trump, I'm proud to say to small-business owners, we're going to repeal death taxes once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to businesses, the President has made it clear that we're going to cut the business tax rate to 15 percent to make sure that businesses across this country can compete with businesses all across the world. And we're going to make sure small businesses can realize that benefit as well. (Applause.)\nOur administration is already working with the Congress to craft a historic tax-cut bill. In fact, later today, Congress and the White House will issue a statement laying out our guiding principles for tax reform. I'll make you a promise: Discussions and negotiations will continue, details will continue to be worked out. But rest assured, we're going to cut taxes -- and we're going to cut taxes this year. (Applause.)\nMen and women of the NFIB, this is the moment, now is the time. So today I want to offer you a challenge -- a challenge to continue to stand with our President as he fights for job creators all across this country and for a boundless American future.\nAs you meet with your elected representatives in Congress this week, tell them -- tell them you're counting on them to support the President's agenda to move this country forward. Tell them you're counting on them repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes, and continue to roll back the heavy hand of government that stands in the way of our prosperity.\nAnd when you go and speak with them, speak with confidence. The truth is that small-business owners, I think -- and maybe I'm a little biased because I come from a small, family business -- you're really the heart of America. In so many ways, every single one of you has a story that springs straight out of the American Dream. You embody the American spirit. You never quit, you never back down, you never give up, no matter the odds. That's how you make it in a small business.\nAnd that's the attitude that you need to bring here to Washington, D.C. Tell them to bring the same determination and the same persistence to the cause of strengthening and reviving the American economy. And I just want to assure you that your voices will be heard, as they always have been throughout the 75-year history of the NFIB and your engagement.\nThe truth of the matter is that our elected representatives know where the strength of this country lies, and it lies, I believe, in many places -- it lies in the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America. (Applause.) It lies in the hearts of men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement at every level in the United States of America. (Applause.) Our teachers, our public servants.\nBut I truly do believe that the strength of America also lies in the courage and in the hearts of men and women who get up every day, put their feet on the floor, and make a small business work. (Applause.)\nAnd so I want to encourage you on. Let your voice be heard, but also have faith. Have faith that there are better days ahead for America; that what we've begun to see in the recovery of the American spirit and the rebound of the American economy is really just the beginning. And under President Donald Trump, with your help, I know the best days for America and for American small business are yet to come.\nAnd, lastly, have that other kind of faith. This is a challenging time in the wider world, and it's been a challenging time for businesses. But help is on the way, and hope always springs eternal -- because for so many of you, like for me and my little family, our hope ultimately doesn't come from our government or from our elected leaders, but our hope comes from someplace deeper. And so I encourage you to avail yourself of that faith in these times, and pray for the good leaders who serve in this building. Continue to pray for our President and all the families that serve around him.\nAnd pray with confidence that He who said: I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and future -- says that as much to this generation of Americans as He's ever said it before.\nAnd so I say with faith today -- with boundless faith in the American people, so well represented here at the NFIB -- with faith in the determination of our President, and with faith in He who has ever been with those who first landed on the shores of this Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, that we will make America prosperous again. We will make America safe again. And to borrow a phrase, together we will Make America Great Again.\nThank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

And on behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. It's going to be my great honor today and, in fact, a privilege to administer the oath of office to the 42nd United States Ambassador to Japan, Bill Hagerty. (Applause.)\nWe're joined today by some very distinguished guests. Senator Alexander and Senator Corker are both from Bill Hagerty's home state of Tennessee. Would you join me in welcoming both of them? (Applause.)\nI see distinguished members of the military and other honored guests. I know the family is very grateful you're here, as is the President and myself.\nWe're joined today also by the most distinguished guests who are here, and that is our incoming ambassador's wonderful family -- his mother, Ruth -- (applause) -- and most especially, his wonderful wife Chrissy and their four beautiful children. (Applause.) Could you guys stand up? The Hagerty family heads to Japan, and it's a big crew.\nWe also have many other honored guests with us today, including the Commander of the United States Armed Forces Japan, General Jerry Martinez, and many distinguished members of Congress from his home state, as well as the senators I mentioned before. In fact, it's important to note that Senator Corker is, in fact, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and we're truly honored to have you and Senator Alexander here.\nWe're also joined by members of Congress from the House of Representatives in Tennessee -- Congressman John Duncan, Congresswoman Diane Black, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Scott DesJarlais, David Kustoff, and Congressman Phil Roe. Would you give them all a round of applause.

One of the clearest signs of that commitment, I believe, today, is the President's choice of Bill Hagerty as America's Ambassador to Japan. (Applause.)\nBill, throughout your life, you have helped to strengthen the ties between America and Japan. It started early in your career, when you actually lived in Japan on a three-year assignment as a consultant.\nYou then served as an economic advisor under President George Herbert Walker Bush, and in your time as Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, you worked with Japanese firms to make investments in your home state that have created good-paying jobs for the people of Tennessee.\nBut your commitment to Japan reaches far beyond a professional level. Your service on the Board of the Far East Council of the Boy Scouts of America has brought the people of our nations closer together and has deepened our friendship of our nations for generations to come.\nPresident Trump has now called on you to represent the United States as our ambassador to Japan. This is a momentous time in the life of our alliance.\nIn this time of challenge and widening threats in the region, the U.S.-Japan alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and freedom in the Asia-Pacific. The United States and Japan stand together resolutely to confront whatever threats are posed to us, especially those posed by the regime in North Korea -- and we always will. (Applause.)\nAnd the President is also committed to expanding our bonds of commerce. As President Trump said when he met with Prime Minister Abe earlier this year, in his words, the \"vibrant exchange between us is truly a blessing\" -- and so it is.\nAnd through the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue, which the President had me launch during my visit in April, our nations have been working tirelessly to deepen our bilateral economic ties even further, and we look forward to working with you to advance that effort.\nBill, given your integrity, your record of leadership, and your distinguished history, the President and I are confident that you will excel in this new role. You will help make the extraordinary friendship and alliance between the United States and Japan even stronger.\nAnd now it is my privilege to administer to you the oath of office.\n(The oath of office is administered.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce to you the United States Ambassador to Japan, William Frances Hagerty IV.

But in the wake of that horrific attack, our nation was deeply inspired by the heroism of America's first responders, and we celebrate that today.\nToday, President Trump will pay a debt of gratitude to the men and women who inspired the nation that day and all they represent.\nThis week, America good news. The nation rejoiced with word that Congressman Steve Scalise was released from the hospital.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126742", "text": "Today, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) issued the following joint statement on tax reform:\n\"For the first time in many years, the American people have elected a President and Congress that are fully committed to ensuring that ordinary Americans keep more of their hard-earned money and that our tax policies encourage employers to invest, hire, and grow. And under the leadership of President Trump, the White House and Treasury have met with over 200 members of the House and Senate and hundreds of grassroots and business groups to talk and listen to ideas about tax reform.\n\"We are all united in the belief that the single most important action we can take to grow our economy and help the middle class get ahead is to fix our broken tax code for families, small business, and American job creators competing at home and around the globe. Our shared commitment to fixing America's broken tax code represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and so for three months we have been meeting regularly to develop a shared template for tax reform.\n\"Over many years, the members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have examined various options for tax reform. During our meetings, the Chairmen of those committees have brought to the table the views and priorities of their committee members. Building on this work, as well as on the efforts of the Administration and input from other stakeholders, we are confident that a shared vision for tax reform exists, and are prepared for the two committees to take the lead and begin producing legislation for the President to sign.\n\"Above all, the mission of the committees is to protect American jobs and make taxes simpler, fairer, and lower for hard-working American families. We have always been in agreement that tax relief for American families should be at the heart of our plan. We also believe there should be a lower tax rate for small businesses so they can compete with larger ones, and lower rates for all American businesses so they can compete with foreign ones. The goal is a plan that reduces tax rates as much as possible, allows unprecedented capital expensing, places a priority on permanence, and creates a system that encourages American companies to bring back jobs and profits trapped overseas. And we are now confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the U.S. tax base. While we have debated the pro-growth benefits of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform.\n\"Given our shared sense of purpose, the time has arrived for the two tax-writing committees to develop and draft legislation that will result in the first comprehensive tax reform in a generation. It will be the responsibility of the members of those committees to produce legislation that achieves the goals shared broadly within Congress, the Administration, and by citizens who have been burdened for too long by an outdated tax system. Our expectation is for this legislation to move through the committees this fall, under regular order, followed by consideration on the House and Senate floors. As the committees work toward this end, our hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle will participate in this effort. The President fully supports these principles and is committed to this approach. American families are counting on us to deliver historic tax reform. And we will.\"", "timestamp": "2017-07-27", "title": "Press Release - Joint Statement on Tax Reform"}
{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126731", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:21 P.M. EST\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Before we get started on some of the Q&A, I'd like to bring up Tom Homan, which some of you guys mays know and remember, the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Rob Hur, the Principal Deputy Attorney General, to talk with you about what the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are doing to eradicate criminal organizations like MS-13.\nMr. Hur will speak to the Justice Department's work first, then Mr. Homan will discuss the ICE component, and Tom will stay and answer your questions.\nAs always, I'd like to put out a friendly reminder for you guys to stay on topic. And after that, I'll come back up to take your questions. Thanks, guys.\nMR. HUR: Good afternoon. My name is Robert Hur. About five weeks ago, I was sworn in as the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice. In that role, I serve as the principal advisor to the Deputy Attorney General. I appreciate the chance to talk to you about the Justice Department's aggressive efforts to achieve this administration's goal of dismantling the gang, la Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13.\nAs you all know, the President is traveling to Long Island tomorrow to talk about our fight to eradicate the violent threat of MS-13. And as we speak, the Attorney General is in El Salvador, where he will spend the next two days addressing the root of this problem, the San Salvadorian prisons that house the leaders of this dangerous gang.\nWhile there, the Attorney General will meet with members of the Justice Department's transnational anti-gang taskforce on the ground, in El Salvador, and the attorneys general from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to discuss joint efforts to disrupt and take down MS-13.\nEarlier in my career, I served as a federal prosecutor in Maryland, where I personally prosecuted a number of MS-13 racketeering cases. These included capital cases in which the defendants' crimes were so violent and so heinous that the government saw fit to pursue the death penalty.\nThrough these prosecutions I learned firsthand from the victims, their grieving and heartbroken families, and other members of terrorized communities just want a scourge this group of thugs really is.\nThis gang's chilling motto is: \"Mata, viola, controla\" -- which means \"kill, rape, and control.\" They seek to live up to this motto through truly shocking acts of violence designed to instill fear. Vicious machete attacks, execution-style gunshots, gang-rape, and human trafficking. They use whatever they can get their hands on -- guns, knives, machetes, baseball bats, tire irons, or their fists and feet -- not just to inflict violence. They use violence to shock, to send a message, and to control territory here in the U.S. and in Central America.\nThe Attorney General has answered the President's call. And we at the Justice Department are moving forward aggressively against MS-13. Specifically, pursuant to the President's direction and executive orders, the Attorney General has directed the department's law enforcement agencies -- ATF, DEA, FBI and the Marshals Service, as well as federal prosecutors across the country -- to prioritize the prosecution of gang members, specifically MS-13.\nThe Attorney General has issued charging guidance regarding violent crime and criminal immigration enforcement, both of which directly target MS-13 members and their associates. In addition, the Department of Justice has requested funding for 300 more federal prosecutors to focus specifically on violent crime and criminal immigration enforcement.\nWe've also prioritize multi-agency and cross-border collaboration in order to attack MS-13 from all angles. The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security are coordinating our anti-gang efforts to ensure that we bring both criminal and immigration laws to bear in the fight against transnational gangs.\nWe continue our critical partnerships with state and local law enforcement around the country whose brave men and women are truly on the front lines in the fight against MS-13. And we work, of course, hand in glove with our law enforcement partners in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. They are helping us take the fight to MS-13 on its home turf. It speaks volumes that the Attorney General himself has traveled to the nerve center of MS-13 and is standing in solidarity with our partners in Central America.\nIndeed, earlier today, just hours ago, El Salvadorian prosecutors announced that they have filed charges against, and arrested, over the past 36 hours, hundreds of members of MS-13 in El Salvador. Many of the defendants are members of MS-13 Peajes Locos Salvatruchos clique who are centered in the La Paz department of El Salvador.\nEarlier this year, members of this MS-13 clique committed several high-profile murders in El Salvador. The shooter in these murders fled to the United States and is now in ICE custody pending immigration proceedings. This prosecution showcases just how closely we are working with our partners in El Salvador to combat MS-13. Specifically, U.S. law enforcement agents with ICE, who are on the ground in El Salvador, are coordinating with their counterparts here in the U.S. to ensure that the shooter is removed from the United States as quickly as possible to face charges in El Salvador.\nThis investigation is being handled by Salvadorian gang prosecutors who are trained and mentored by embedded DOJ prosecutors in El Salvador and Salvadorian police officers who are trained and mentored by the FBI and advisors from the State Department.\nAt the request of Salvadorian prosecutors, the Justice Department has also arranged to have an essential witness to the murders transported to El Salvador for court proceedings.\nThe United States law enforcement and federal prosecutors recently targeted leaders and members of the same Peajes clique operating here in Maryland, charging 16 defendants with racketeering offenses involving murder and attempted murder, the last of whom was sentenced this year to life imprisonment. These are very significant blows to MS-13 and are made possible by our close cross-border coordination.\nWe've also revitalized the Institutional Hearing Program, which brings immigration judges to Bureau Prisons facilities to adjudicate the immigration status of federal criminal alien inmates while they're incarcerated. This results in much quicker deportation after these criminals serve out their prison sentences here in the United States.\nFinally, we are also holding sanctuary cities accountable for their lawless conduct. The Attorney General will not allow sanctuary cities to become sanctuaries for criminals. Earlier this week, the Attorney General announced new grant conditions. Cities and states may only receive JAG grants if they comply with federal law, allow federal immigration officials access to detention facilities, and provide 48 hours' notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities.\nTaking on MS-13 is a top priority of this administration and this Justice Department. We will not tire and we will not fail. I am humbled to once again be in a position to work to reduce and ultimately decimate this gang to make our communities safe for all Americans.\nThank you.\nMR. HOMAN: Good afternoon. I'm Tom Homan. I'm the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE. Targeting, arresting, and removing members of violent street gangs, such as MS-13, sends a clear message to criminal enterprises around the world: You are not welcome in the United States, and you'll find no harbor here.\nPresident Trump made it a priority to get these criminals off our streets and, when possible, out of our country. And that's exactly what the men and women of ICE are going to do every single day to help keep America safe.\nICE's Homeland Security Investigation, known as HSI National Gang Unit, leads our efforts along with our deportation officers to identify and arrest gang members while working to dismantle the organizational structure that supports them.\nGang members are involved in a broad range of criminal activity, including murder, extortion, narcotics trafficking, weapons trafficking, human smuggling, and other crimes with a nexus of border security.\nSince the beginning of January of this year, ICE's Homeland Security Investigation has already arrested 3,311 gang members across the country, a -- targeted operation. I'll speak just about two.\nProject New Dawn: A recent gang surge led by ICE HSI netted 1,378 gang arrests.\nOperation Matador -- up in New York State: Since May 9th has netted over 100 gang members and affiliates, the vast majority of MS-13 members.\nMake no mistake, organized violent transnational gangs threaten the safety of our communities, not just in major metropolitan areas, but in our suburbs, like Suffolk County in New York, where I'll be joining the President tomorrow to discuss this very issue.\nLet me share just a couple of examples that demonstrate the violence of these criminals. Recently, two MS-13 members who were juveniles, arrested as part of Operation Matador, have been implicated in a quadruple homicide of four young adults in New York. An additional MS-13 arrest admitted to be complicit in homicides of two juvenile females. Multiple other Operation Matador MS-13 arrests have led to admissions on narcotics trafficking, weapons smuggling, and intelligence on other unsolved crimes in the region.\nThe proliferation of MS-13 remains an ongoing challenge for law enforcement everywhere. Our efforts to eradicate gangs such as this are much more effective in areas where our partnership with local law enforcement is the strongest.\nAs I said the last time I was here, I cannot stress enough: Our operations are more effective when there are strong local partnerships supporting them. Sanctuary city policies only make it more difficult, if not impossible, for ICE to remove known gang members and other criminal aliens who are removed from this country without the opportunity to commit additional crimes.\nAs I said when I was here at the podium a month ago: Cooperation is critical. It is often state and local law enforcement, not ICE, that first come into contact with transnational gang members. Together, through partnership, we can keep our streets safe. Together, our gang is bigger than theirs.\nIn addition to making our community safer, the intelligence gathered from operations targeting MS-13 helps our agents and investigators continue their efforts to fully dismantle these global criminal enterprises, from the command and control structure in El Salvador to the street members walking our communities, and everybody in between.\nIn closing I'll say this: The progress we're making would not be possible without the brave and dedicated men and women of ICE. These are professionals, American patriots, who leave the safety of their homes and their families every day to help keep us safe, to keep people safe they'll never meet. And I am honored and proud to represent them here today.\nWith that, I'll take questions.\nQ: Thank you. In Montgomery County there has been MS-13 activity. And when they have prosecuted MS-13 there, they have said that members of MS-13, some of them are citizens. And to get help from the immigrant community where they're plaguing -- you know, the plague is on the immigrant community -- that they have not been successful because they're afraid of being taken out of the country, that you're going to deport them.\nSo for those in the immigrant community who are being taken advantage of, do you guys -- are you going to offer any type of support for those who are not involved in MS-13, who come forward to assist law enforcement? Because local law enforcement says that's the largest problem they have in getting people to come forward -- they think they're going to be deported.\nMR. HOMAN: Well, you all can help with that message, right? I mean, the mis-messaging that ICE is out there doing neighborhood raids and roadblocks and things that we were being accused of doing. We got to get the message straight: ICE prioritizes arrests based on criminal threats, national security, those who violate immigration laws.\nHowever, if they're a victim or witness, we're not out looking for victims or witnesses. I believe that these -- especially MS-13 -- they victimize the very communities in which they live. So if the immigrant community is being victimized, they don't want them in the community either.\nThey should be safe to go to law enforcement, report the crime. Again, we do not target victims of crime. Matter of fact, there's actually benefits to victims of crimes through the immigration process. So they should feel safe to go and report criminal activity. And we're going target the most violent criminals -- not the witness, not the victims -- to remove them.\nAnd we need their help. We need the community's help but most importantly, we need local law enforcement's help, especially county jails that will have an MS-13 booked in that county jail, but if that county jail is located in a sanctuary city, they get released back to the streets. That's what we need to change. We need cooperation from local law enforcement.\nQ: But you're saying -- point blank, you're not going to take advantage of the immigrant communities who are victims, right?\nMR. HOMAN: Taking advantage of immigrant communities? Look, we're --\nQ: If they're victims, they're not going to be deported.\nMR. HOMAN: We need the immigrant community to assist us in identifying the most heinous criminals, and that's MS-13. It's the most violent gang out there.\nSo again, I'll say this again: If there is a victim of crime and they come forward, we're not looking to arrest a victim of crime. We're looking to arrest the bad guy, all right?\nNow, let me make this clear -- now, there's a population of illegal aliens are off the table? I'm not saying that. But victims of crime have certain protections, and they need to take full advantage of the protections.\nMa'am.\nQ: Thank you. Do you have a count for how many people are actually a part of the MS-13 in cities across the country? And what has the reaction been from sanctuary cities to the new policy that was announced earlier this week by the Attorney General? And if you could speak broadly about -- obviously the President has been very critical of the Attorney General recently. He has overseen everything that you're talking about. Has that criticism in any way impacted your ability and federal law enforcement's ability to do their jobs?\nMR. HOMAN: That's a lot of questions. I can tell you that thousands of MS-13 members in the country and that number changes every day depending on who you deport, who sneaks into the country.\nAs far as sanctuary cities, I don't know how they feel about the recent legislation, the recent action taken by DOJ. But I'll say it once again: Sanctuary cities are a criminal's biggest friend. If you're an alien smuggler and you're smuggling people in this country for a living, that is one sales pitch -- \"we can get you to a sanctuary city where that city will help shield you from immigration.\"\nSo, you know, I've said it every time I speak; I say, sanctuary cities need to help us keep their community safe. Sanctuary cities not only endanger public safety, they endanger my law enforcement officers, because when we can't get a criminal alien -- violent alien -- out of a county jail, it means one of our officers will knock on the door -- which anybody in law enforcement knows, that's one of the most dangerous things to do. So rather than arresting a violent criminal in the safety, security, and privacy of a county jail, we got to go knock on a door. We got to arrest them in the community.\nThe community is put at risk, our officers are put at risk, and the alien himself is put at risk. We got to start thinking about public safety and the men and women of ICE and the men and women of the Border Patrol who we've lost many over the last few years at the hands of violent criminal aliens. We got to join forces with these cities. These cities have to come to us. They have to work with us to keep our communities safe.\nSir.\nQ: And on the Attorney General -- anything on the Attorney General?\nMR. HOMAN: What was the question on the Attorney General?\nQ: The fact that the President has been criticizing him recently, has that in any way impacted your ability, federal law enforcement's ability to do their job?\nMR. HOMAN: ICE is going to do our job. We're going to continue to enforce the law. The Attorney General is a strong supporter of immigration enforcement, and so is the President, and I'll end it there.\nBut I can tell you, nothing is going to change the way we do our business. The men and women of ICE are professionals. We're going to keep enforcing the law within the orders of the executive order.\nSir.\nQ: The previous administration also told the country to prioritize criminal gangs. Are you telling the country now that it didn't? And if you're not, what is different about your approach as compared to the previous administration's approach with MS-13 and those gangs like it?\nMR. HOMAN: Well, I can tell you that the prior administration prioritized criminals and national security threats, but the difference is, for those that criminal aliens get booked in a county jail, on the prior administration they needed a conviction before we could put a detainer on them and put them in our custody.\nThat's not necessary anymore. If you've been arrested for a serious crime, and you're in a county jail, we're going to drop a detainer, we're going to take the person into custody.\nQ: And what does that mean, dropping the detainer?\nMR. HOMAN: That means we'll ask that the local jurisdiction hang on to them until we can get there to take custody of them when they're with you.\nQ: Has that proven effective?\nMR. HOMAN: Yes. I think we got more jurisdictions coming to the table now. You know, the story is -- now we got sanctuary cities here and there, but more jurisdictions, more law enforcement comes to the table now. The 287(g) agreements -- we've already doubled those agreements on this administration. I expect to triple those agreements by the end of the year.\nMost law enforcement agrees with what I'm saying up here. The street cops -- they want to work with us and they want to identify these threats to the community and get them out of their communities. These people are not welcome in their communities, and local law enforcement are teaming up with us. The operation I spoke about here in New York City -- we work with Nassau County, Suffolk County, NYPD -- all these jurisdictions want to get the criminal element out of their neighborhoods. The immigrant communities themselves, they don't want these people in their communities. We all should be on the same page here.\nBut again, New York City -- one of those places where, you know, we can't get into Riker's Island and put our hands on people that are here illegally and they're criminal aliens. When it comes to gang members -- gang members walk out of the county jails and sanctuary cities every day across this country. That's what we need to change.\nMa'am.\nQ: How are suspected gang members being identified for ICE enforcement? Is it just through local law enforcement? Are there databases that you're using? Like, how do you know how to find these gang members?\nMR. HOMAN: Local law enforcement, they're usually the ones that -- they have the most intelligence on gang members. As far as what we look for to find gang members, I'd rather not discuss that because I certainly don't want to share that information with the gang members who may be watching and say, okay, well, we'll just do this a little bit different.\nThere is a myriad of factors we look -- it's just not -- we don't arrest people for the way they look. I want to make that clear, because I've seen media accounts about people with tattoos and clothing. That is one of many, many factors we look at. So it's really quite law enforcement-sensitive how we identify, target, and locate gang members.\nSo I can tell you that the men and women of ICE are well-trained. Other federal agencies -- whether it's the Bureau, or whether it's the Suffolk County, Nassau County -- they do this for a living. They're professionals. They look at a lot of factors, including database checks. But I'd rather not share the factors we all consider to look at that, because I really don't want to share that with the criminal element who may be watching this program.\nQ: Thank you. You said that victims of crimes who are immigrants will not be targeted. In February, your agency detained a woman in El Paso, Texas who was seeking a protective order against a domestic abuser. Can you say now that your agency will not be doing that again? And if it's been done in the past, why should we believe that it won't be done in the future?\nMR. HOMAN: Okay, that case you're talking about, you obviously don't know all the facts that I do. That is not the way -- there's much more to that story than you're presenting here today. I can tell you that was a solid arrest and it's under litigation. I can't give you all the information I have, but that was a good arrest, that was a public safety arrest, and I can't say anything more because it's in litigation.\nMS. SANDERS: He'll take one last question, guys.\nQ: You focused, and the President is going to focus tomorrow, on the most violent gangs, MS-13, and suggesting that that's what ICE is focused on. I'm reading a story here from just last month that said the biggest number -- that ICE arrests are up of illegal immigrants, and the sharpest spike is seen for non-criminals. I think that the other side of the issue would say that ICE and this administration really is going after non-criminals, and just using these moments to sort of suggest otherwise. What do you say about that?\nMR. HOMAN: It's ridiculous. I mean, under the prior administration, non-criminals were not a priority. So when you go from 0 to 100, of course you're going to see the biggest rise in that. The executive orders are clear. Anybody who reads the executive orders -- no population is off the table.\nSo non-criminals -- yeah, those that get a court order from a judge that refuse to leave, we're looking for them. Those who enter the country illegally, I've said it 100 times, that is a crime to enter this country illegally. And when they get their due process at great taxpayer expense -- billions of dollars are spent on border security, immigration court, detention. So when they get their due process, and a federal judge orders them removed, that order needs to mean something or the whole system has no integrity.\nNowhere else in law enforcement has anybody asked a law enforcement agency to ignore a judge's order from a bench. They've had their due process; our job is to enforce those orders and that that's what we do.\nAnd for the people that say that we concentrate too much on those that are not criminals, beyond them committing a crime entering the country illegally, they've not committed yet another crime -- \"You should ignore them. They've been here. Let them go\" -- that message drives what happened in San Antonio. That message drives what happened in Victoria, Texas that I investigated back in 2003.\nIf we send the message that if you get into the country, you get by the Border Patrol, and don't get arrested by local law enforcement for another crime, and no one is looking for you -- that is a magnet; that is a pull factor. We got to stop that messaging. We got to tell people it's not okay to violate laws in this country. You can't want to be a part of this country and not respect its laws. You can't have it both ways.\nSo until we get that message clear that there is no safe haven here. And if you're in sanctuary cities, that's where we'll send additional resources to look for you at your home, at place of employment. We're going to enforce the law. We got to stop sending the message that people that don't commit yet another crime should be forgotten. Don't enforce the law.\nQ: If I could on a previous question, you said you needed cooperation of local communities. You hear that a lot from law enforcement, and including American immigrants, families that maybe have mixed situations. President Trump the other day called it, in a speech in Ohio, twice referred to criminal gang members as \"animals.\" I think there are some who would say, well, that's another attempt to paint broader swaths of immigrants as criminal and violent. He wasn't that specific about who he was talking about necessarily, and I'm wondering if you think that kind of rhetoric is appropriate or whether that could potentially set back some of your efforts in trying to convince community members to work with your department.\nMR. HOMAN: As a criminal law enforcement officer, I can tell you that criminal aliens are a threat not only to public safety but to national security. We got to enforce the laws. The men and women of ICE are doing it in a professional manner. And I shared with you the last time I was here why it's so important to let the folks know in Central America and in Mexico -- let those that want to come to the United States to find themselves in a sanctuary city -- why it's so important to send a message they should not make that dangerous trek.\nIn my years of -- 33 years of doing this job, these are criminal organizations that transport these people into the country. The same organizations, the same illicit pathways that smuggle drugs, smuggle weapons, and smuggle people that want to do harm to this country. And by continuing to ignore that segment of the illegal population, we are bankrolling these criminal organizations. As I said earlier, sanctuary cities -- that's the alien smuggler's best friend. That's their advertisement: \"We'll get you to sanctuary city.\"\nAnd I'm telling you, what I've seen in my career -- I've seen people that were killed, could not pay their smuggling fee. We talked to women who have been raped. Children have been molested. People have been killed. You know, I shared with the media yesterday -- in Phoenix, Arizona, during the hostage crisis several years ago, people couldn't pay their fees. The fees will double once they got -- they couldn't pay their fees. We rescued one man who was duct-taped from head to toe, his whole face and head were duct-taped and he had a hole poked in the mouth with a straw so he could breathe for two days.\nWhen I was in Victoria, Texas, I did stand in the back of a tractor trailer with 19 dead aliens with a five-year-old that suffered. What do you think that five-year-old went through the last 30 minutes of his life? What do you think his father went through the last 30 minutes of his life looking down at his child, knowing he couldn't help him because they were locked in the back of a tractor trailer?\nQ: (Inaudible) people over 18, who are part of this gang, are animals?\nMR. HOMAN: I'm not calling anybody an animal. I'm saying there are those who break the law and those who don't break the law. You got to respect the laws of this country. There are millions of people that are members of this society that enter this country the right way. And what's what we need to push. We need to push -- enter this -- there's a legal way and an illegal way. We got to be pushing the legal message out there and stop sending this message that if you don't commit yet another crime, beyond the crime you committed when you came to this country, that it's okay to be here. It's not okay to be here illegally. It's not okay to violate the laws of this country. We're going to enforce the law.\nThat is why -- and with everything you're reading right now, all these horrific events, that's why we need more -- we need the 10,000 officers that President Trump has promised so we can go after these gangs even harder in the criminal alien population. We need the border wall. The border wall is one more tool in the toolbox that might prevent some of the things from happening. That is why what President Trump is asking us to do, that is why what he's proposing for border security makes sense for the law enforcement community -- not just Tom Homan at ICE, but the 20,000 men and women that work at ICE, the 20,000 Border Patrol agents that wear the uniform and step on the front line every day. We need this help. We need these executive orders to make sense of what we do every day.\nMS. SANDERS: Thanks so much, Tom. We really appreciate it.\nThank you, Tom, Rob. Just like the dedicated men and women of ICE and DOJ who are unquestionably producing results every day in these fights against vicious cartels, Senate Republicans now have an opportunity this evening to deliver on one of our biggest promises to the American people.\nOn the Hill, the Senate is gearing up for a series of votes on the Republican plans to finally repeal and replace Obamacare and replace it with the Freedom Health Care Bill. Congressional Republicans have been telling the American people that, given the chance, they would save them from this increasing damage of this disastrous law.\nAfter seven years of skyrocketing premiums and dwindling healthcare options, now is there chance to act. The President looks forward to seeing the Senate fulfill that promise later tonight when they finally repeal Obamacare and end the nightmares it has caused for American families and businesses.\nI hate to start the Q&A off on a low note, but I wanted to get ahead of some of the personnel-related questions and just let you guys know ahead of time that, no, I cannot confirm whether or not Sean Spicer will be on \"Dancing with the Stars\" upon leaving the White House. (Laughter.)\nAnd with that, I will take your questions. Jonathan.\nQ: Sarah, does the President have confidence in his Chief of Staff?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think I've addressed this question when it comes to staffing and personnel many times, that if the President doesn't, then he'll make that decision. We all serve at the pleasure of the President, and if he gets to a place where that isn't the case, he'll let you know.\nQ: So you can't say right now if the President has full confidence in Chief of Staff Reince Priebus?\nMS. SANDERS: I think I just answered that. Look, I think what we have -- this is a White House that has a lot of different perspectives, because the President hires the very best people. They're not always going to agree. There are going to be a lot of different ideas. Unlike previous administration, this isn't groupthink. We all come and have a chance to voice those ideas, voice those perspectives, and have a lot of healthy competition. And with that competition you usually get the best results. The President likes that type of competition and encourages it. The people that are here are here because they love the President, they love this country, and they want to see the best things happen. And sometimes you're going to have different ideas come to the table. That's all we're talking about.\nQ: But we're talking about public humiliation of both the Attorney General and now the Chief of Staff, left to kind of wonder about their own fate and their own status within this administration.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that the President has spoken about that. Particularly on Attorney General Sessions -- look, he's been clear that he was disappointed with his decision to recuse himself. But at the same time, as I've said -- look, Attorney General Sessions knows better than anybody that the President and his campaign had nothing to do with Russia, and his decision to recuse himself was disappointing to the President. At the same time, the President wants him to do his job, do it properly. He wants him to be tough on the intelligence leaks, and he wants him to move forward.\nQ: Lindsay Graham says there will be \"holy hell to pay\" if Attorney General Sessions is fired. What does the President say to that?\nMS. SANDERS: You know, I haven't asked him about Lindsay Graham's comments.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. The President -- excuse me, the Pentagon has announced that the President's statements via Twitter did not change the transgender policy in the military and that the White House actually has to issue a policy directive to the Secretary of Defense to make that change happen. So, two questions. Does the President plan to do so? And if so, how will that affect transgender troops that are currently serving?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said yesterday, the White House will work with the Department of Defense and all of the relevant parties to make sure that we fully implement this policy moving forward and do so in a lawful manner.\nQ: But what is the policy? And was the President aware that he can't make policy changes via statements on Twitter? Because the Pentagon is saying --\nMS. SANDERS: I think he was making the announcement of the policy change. So that was --\nQ: So the policy hasn't yet been formulated?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, like I said, they are going to have to work out the details on how that all moves forward to lawfully implement that policy change from this point.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. Moving on to healthcare, you talked about how Senate Republicans have the chance tonight to really undo Obamacare. But it seems like the thing that's most likely to get through is the skinny repeal, and that would just kind of -- that would maybe get rid of the mandate and some other things. But it's not the massive overhaul that had been promised. So would the White House support just a skinny repeal, that being signed into law?\nMS. SANDERS: We certainly support progress moving forward, and that's what we're seeing taking place in the Senate right now.\nAnd I think that that's -- the place where we've been since we started this is we're looking for moving the ball forward down the field, repealing and replacing it with a better healthcare system. And this is one step within that process.\nQ: But does the White House believe that a skinny repeal on its own would be enough to address the issues of premiums -- rising premiums and deductibles and things like that? Would the President sign just a skinny repeal?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, we've got see what they get to tonight. We haven't seen a final piece of legislation. We're continuing to work with the Senate to make sure we get the best healthcare we can.\nQ: Yes, Sarah. I want to ask two questions -- one about the President's management style and one about immigration enforcement.\nSo on the President's management style, is the President aware that occasionally -- days like yesterday, when he had a big jobs announcement he wanted to roll out -- that his seemingly impulsive decisions to make an announcement on transgender troops steps on his own message? Is the President aware of that dynamic? And is he interested in changing it at all?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President is aware that he can walk and chew gum at the same time. This is a White House that takes on a lot of different things every day, not just one. And we're going to continue to do that moving forward.\nQ: On immigration -- I had a question on immigration enforcement.\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry.\nQ: So this week when the President spoke in Ohio, he spoke about MS-13 and he gave a litany of the violence that they're capable of. And then he said, \"Our guys are rougher than their guys.\" What did the President mean by that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President means that our guys are going to do whatever it takes to protect Americans, protect American lives, protect our borders.\nQ: Is that a license for the use of more force when it comes to making arrests against MS-13?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President wants people to do their jobs -- not go beyond the scope of what they should do. But he wants to protect our country. He wants to protect American people, and he's asked the law enforcement agencies to step up and help be part of that process as I think we would all expect for them to.\nQ: Does he want the law enforcement agencies to change the rules of the use of force when it comes to making arrests against MS-13?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any specific changes.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Anthony Scaramucci was on CNN today talking about Reince Priebus. He said, \"If he wants to prove he's not a leaker, let him do it.\" I can't imagine that you would speak on Anthony's behalf, but if you would, does he think that Reince Priebus is a leaker? Or does the White House, does the President think that Reince is leaking?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to comment on Anthony's suggestion. I'll let him answer for himself. I think I made pretty clear where the President is, and I don't have anything to add beyond that.\nQ: I had a tax question, too, please. Does the President believe that tax overhaul should increase the budget deficit? Or should it be revenue neutral?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we're continuing to make announcements on the details of the tax reform plan. As I'm sure you all saw, there was a joint statement that came out earlier today. And we're making a lot of progress on this front. As we get closer to lining out the final details, we'll certainly be putting those out in front of all of you.\nThe big pieces are simplification and helping take off the relief for the middle class. Those are big places that we're really focused, and we're going to continue to do that.\nAs you saw from the statement, the border adjustment tax was taken off the table, and that's another big step forward in the process.\nPeter.\nQ: Sarah, can I ask you quickly about Anthony Scaramucci? A little bit of housekeeping. One --\nMS. SANDERS: Only if you do it quickly.\nQ: Fine. Has he taken an oath of office?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Has Anthony Scaramucci taken an oath of office?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: Have his security clearances gone through yet?\nMS. SANDERS: As always, we do not discuss security clearances by staff at the White House.\nQ: Is he an official member of the White House staff now? Initially it was announced that it would be in mid-August.\nMS. SANDERS: He is working at the White House, but on your other questions, I can't answer that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: So let me follow up on --\nQ: Thank you, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: We're going to go with one-question Thursday because we're kind of tight on time. As you guys know, the President has got an open-press event.\nQ: Let me ask you about the Boy Scouts then, if I can very quickly --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm going to actually go to, John. Sorry, Peter.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I do have to ask you about the healthcare bill. Many who are in the Freedom Caucus say that they would oppose the skinny repeal that was referred to earlier; that if a measure came out with just, oh, ending the mandates and ending the tax on medical devices, that that would -- and not addressing anything else, they'd vote against it. Is the President aware of this? And is he making any calls for specific parts of the repeal effort?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the administration has been working hand-in-hand on pushing repeal and replace of Obamacare. We actually like the term \"freedom bill\" a lot better because we think it addresses what this bill actually is -- it removes a lot of those mandates that allow people to have the type of freedom, have states have the freedom that they want. And that was one of the big priorities for this administration. We're happy about that progress.\nAnd we're going to wait and see where this bill ends up later this evening.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks, a lot, Sarah. Is the President -- just to follow up on what John Gizzi just asked you; I don't think you got to that particular part of the question.\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry.\nQ: Is the President picking up the phone? Is he calling those seven or eight Republican senators, making the case for them that this may be their last best hope for repealing and replacing Obamacare? And if he is, what's his message to those particular senators?\nMS. SANDERS: The same one he's been making all along: Let's get the job done. Let's replace a terrible healthcare system with a better one. And he's going to be engaged, and I'll keep you posted on any specifics and people that he talks to.\nPeter.\nQ: He had all of those Republican senators here at the White House last week, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry. Guys, we're real tight on time. I'm really going to try to keep you to one question. Let's be polite to your colleagues.\nQ: Sorry.\nMS. SANDERS: Go ahead, Peter.\nQ: Anthony Scaramucci said this morning that the President might veto the Russia sanctions bill, even though Senator Corker has now withdrawn his objection and that the same version that we've already seen from the House is going to be up for the Senate vote. Is that, in fact, possible? Would he veto that passed with just three negative votes in the House and two negative votes in the Senate?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said yesterday, the President and the administration support sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. We continue to support strong sanctions against those three countries, and we're going to wait and see what that final legislation looks like and make a decision at that point.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMS. SANDERS: As soon as we have a final piece of legislation, we'll let you know.\nDavid.\nQ: In terms of working with the DOD on this new policy, how long is it going to be before you find out what the details are? Weeks, months?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have a specific timeline, but I believe they're going to start moving on it quickly. But we'll keep you posted as those details come out.\nQ: Will it be this year?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I don't have a specific timeline on what that looks like, but I know that they're ready to start moving and work on that implementation.\nMajor.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. Several Senate Republicans have sent signals to this White House: One, don't make a recess appointment because we're not going to allow it; two, there's not going to be a confirmation if there's a new Attorney General nominated. There is a signal being sent: Don't do what we fear you might be contemplating.\nCan you, for the betterment of the Senate Republicans who are working with this White House on a lot of issues, put to rest once and for all the status of the Attorney General -- that he's not going to be fired, there's not going to be a need for a recess appointment, and this issue can be laid to rest, for the country and for Senate Republicans who appear, based on their public statements, to be anxious about this prospect?\nMS. SANDERS: I guess I'm not sure how many times you have to lay an issue to rest. I've tried many times.\nQ: But when you don't say the President has confidence, and the President says \"time will tell,\" as he said earlier this week, I'm only telling you what Senate Republicans, who are in a position that have to deal with this, are saying.\nMS. SANDERS: And I've answered your question. And yesterday you probably saw a statement come out from here that that was more fake news from The Washington Post on the fact that we were considering a recess appointment. I think that sums it up pretty clearly.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. This is a little -- maybe just a little bit off topic. I want to run it by you anyway. Is the President aware of this story --\nMS. SANDERS: It's probably good if we mix it up a little bit.\nQ: Yeah, why not -- right? Is the President aware of the story of the IT staff -- of the congressional IT staffer who most recently worked for Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan, who was recently arrested attempting to leave the country, although he said he was not trying to flee the country? Is the President aware of that particular circumstance? And is he satisfied with the pace of the investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a conversation with him specifically about that, but I do think that is something we should fully look into and there should be a thorough investigation on that.\nKristen.\nQ: Since we only have one question, I'm going to ask you about the Boy Scouts --\nMS. SANDERS: Make it count.\nQ: -- their chief wrote this to family members who were at the President's event earlier this week: \"I want to extend my sincere apologies to those that are Scouting family who are offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree. That was never our intent. We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program.\" Does the President owe the Boy Scouts an apology?\nMS. SANDERS: I was at that event, and I saw nothing but roughly 40,000 to 45,000 Boy Scouts cheering the President on throughout his remarks, and I think they were pretty excited that he was there and happy to hear him speak to them.\nQ: But the head of the Boy Scouts has acknowledged that there was a problem. A lot of parents have expressed frustration in the wake of those comments and felt the need to actually write a letter about it. So does the President owe them an apology?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I was at that event and heard nothing but a lot of cheering and probably one of the most energetic crowds I've seen in front of the President. And so I don't have anything to add. I haven't seen the statement from the Boy Scouts, so I can't comment any further than what I saw firsthand, and that was a lot of individuals, roughly 40,000 to 45,000, as reported, cheering the President on.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I have two for you real quick, if you don't mind.\nMS. SANDERS: You get one. Remember there's a rule today.\nQ: I'm going to be quick. First on Anthony Scaramucci on CNN this morning, he said he had a conversation with Attorney General Jeff Sessions about these supposed leaks. That would appear to violate DOJ guidelines. So I was hoping you could provide some clarity on that front.\nAnd secondly, out of Alaska today, the local paper there is reporting the Senator Murkowski received a phone call from the Secretary of Interior Zinke, threatening the people of -- essentially threatening the services and federal dollars that were spent -- that the administration (inaudible) toward the people of Alaska if she voted a certain way on the healthcare bill. I was hoping if you could confirm that and discuss whether that sort of conversation, if it happened, would be appropriate.\nMS. SANDERS: I'll answer both of your questions with one answer so that it keeps it somewhat fair since you kind of broke the rules. But I'm not going to speak about conversations between Cabinet members and other individuals that I wasn't a part of and haven't had a chance to talk to either individual about.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You suggested that the President continues to have confidence in Reince Priebus based on the fact that he's still in the position, and he's a friend of Anthony Scaramucci who's coming into the administration. At this point, based on what we've seen quite publicly playing out, though, does he think they at least need to sit down and talk, as House Speaker Paul Ryan said, and get whatever this is out of their system so that they can start off the one right foot here?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if he has an opinion on what they should do between the two of them. I think the President, as always, enjoys healthy competition and conversation, and he sees that as such.\nI've got to wrap up here because the President is getting ready to do an event, which I know you all probably want to attend. And I want to leave you with just one last thing, because I close out, on an important development. You guys love to talk about Russia, and there's been nonstop coverage. And the one day that there might have been a question on Russia, there wasn't. Often, we have a lot of media with Russia first, but today there was public testimony that further discredited the phony dossier that's been the source of so much of the fake news and conspiracy theories. And we learned that the firm that produced it was also being paid by the Russians. This is yet the latest piece of evidence that vindicates what the President has said, that this is a witch hunt and a hoax. And it's a shame that the President and the country have had to go through this charade continually. And hopefully this will help us move forward in that process.\nAnd with that, thank you, guys, so much. And we'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 3:05 P.M.

In his remarks, he referred to Matt Mika, Washington director of government relations for Tyson Foods, and Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams, who were wounded in the shootings at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, VA, on June 14.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126729", "text": "Please sit down. Thank you. And thank you to Vice President for doing a fantastic job and for the introduction. We welcome you all. Members of Congress and distinguished guests: We are gathered here today for a very, very special occasion, as we pay tribute to real heroes whose courageous actions under fire saved so many lives in Alexandria, Virginia, just 6 weeks ago.\nOn the morning of June 14, several Members of Congress began their day on the baseball diamond, practicing for one of this town's greatest traditions: the annual charity, Congressional Baseball Game. It was just another beautiful morning until the unthinkable happened. The familiar sounds of baseball were suddenly interrupted by loud, vicious gunfire. Matt Mika, Zachary Barth, and beloved Congressman, and my friend, Steve Scalise were each shot during an attack. Others were injured trying to evade the incoming bullets, of which there were many.\nFortunately, from the moment that gunman began to shoot, he was met by return fire. Capitol Police Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner raced through the bullets—and that's exactly what they did; they raced through the bullets—and immediately engaged the gunman. Minutes later, members of the Alexandria Police Department arrived on scene. Officers Nicole Battaglia, Kevin Jobe, and Alex Jensen joined the fight. Special Agent Griner was shot in the leg—visited her in the hospital, she was hurt very badly—and shrapnel injured Special Agent Bailey as bullets swirled around him.\nDespite their injuries, both officers heroically continued to face down the gunman until they brought him down. And he had rifles; they had handguns. That's a big difference. These officers saved the lives of every innocent person on the field that day, many of them friends of Mike and myself. They're our American heroes, and we salute them. [Applause] Fantastic. That is so beautiful. Thank you.\nWe also salute the Members of Congress who acted with such bravery in the face of danger, shielding each other and caring for the injured. We honor today the emergency dispatchers who directed the first responders to the scene within seconds. They really acted quickly.\nI especially want to recognize all of the personnel from the Alexandria Fire Department and the U.S. Park Police Aviation Unit for providing life support in a crisis where every second mattered. Thank you for what you did that day and for what you do every single day. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nWe also express our deep appreciation for the paramedics, doctors, nurses, and surgeons from MedStar Washington Hospital and George Washington University Hospital for saving the lives of the wounded. Joining us today is Congressman Scalise's medical team: Dr. Jack Sava—where's Jack? Dr. Sava. Stand up, Jack. Come on. That's beautiful. MedStar's Director of Trauma Surgery—and Dr. Robert Golden, the Director of Orthopedic Trauma. Doctor, doctor, congratulations. They were a lot more worried that night at the hospital, weren't they? Great job. You have the gratitude of the entire Nation. Thank you for caring for the victims and for your dear friend Steve, and he is our dear friend. Steve is a fighter. We've known that for a long time.\nThis week, he was been discharged from the hospital and is now beginning weeks of intensive rehabilitation at an in-patient facility. He will recover. We are praying for him, we are pulling for him, and we are sending his family our support and our love.\nSteve's great wife—who I've gotten to know—Jennifer is here with us today, and we applaud the strength and courage that she has shown throughout this incredible ordeal. Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you, Jennifer.\nOther Americans responded to this tragedy in ways that remind us how much stronger we are when we are united. When the Congressional Baseball Game was played just 1 day later, nearly 25,000 people turned out—by far, a record. They raised more than $1.5 million for charity—also, by far, a record. The citizens of Steve's home parish organized a blood drive in his name, and Vice President Pence donated his blood at the congressional blood drive. Thank you, Mike.\nJust recently, House Republicans and Democrats introduced a bill to provide support to Capitol Police officers who are injured on duty. People have been looking at this for a long time. But Jennifer, you can tell Steve that he pulled it off, okay? [Laughter] That's better than being a Whip. [Laughter] I hope it gets to my desk soon. I will sign it immediately. Okay?\nThe assault on June 14 reminded us that evil exists in this world. But it also reminded us that heroes walk in our midst, that love triumphs over tragedy, and that our resolve is stronger than ever. We praise America's law enforcement—and I've been praising them for a long time; they are unbelievable people—for being tough, for doing the tough jobs, the dangerous jobs and, sometimes, thankless jobs with tremendous integrity, devotion, and courage. So I just want to thank law enforcement generally. Thank you.\nI can only tell you from the campaign, the people love you, they respect you, and they admire you. So I know you go through a lot, but they have great admiration. So just remember that, please.\nToday I am deeply honored to present our Nation's highest award for a public safety officer, the Medal of Valor, to Special Agent Crystal Griner, Special Agent David Bailey; and Alexandria Police Department Officers Nicole Battaglia, Kevin Jobe, and Alex Jensen.\nThe Medal of Valor is reserved for those who go above and beyond the call of duty as each of these men and women did that on that fateful day. And they did it with great courage, and they did it with instinct. When our human instincts tell us to run—there's danger—our police and first responders run straight at it, standing in the breach, protecting the innocent, and keeping our loved ones safe.\nNow I would like the Military Aide to read the citation, as these American heroes step forward to receive the Medal of Valor.\n[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Ginny R. Nadolny, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Teddy R. Boyd, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.] Very brave people. Great people. Congratulations to all of you. We are forever in your debt. Thank you. God bless you. God bless our truly amazing law enforcement. And God Bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-07-27", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to First Responders to the Shootings in Alexandria, Virginia"}

MILLER: Hello, everybody. So were just going to do a very quick on-the-record about the MS-13 event. It's a short flight. We're going to be starting our descent soon, so I'm just going to talk real quick, answer a few questions, give you some color for your stories, and then I'm going to go back.\nSo our big focus on MS-13 is getting the resources we need to accomplish to the mission. What does that mean? It means we need more ICE officers. We've got Tom Homan, who you heard from yesterday -- he's just sitting a few rows away from me, right over there -- and we have about 5,000-plus enforcement and removal officers in the country. That's not nearly enough to police an immigration system as large and expansive as ours, or to deal with the fact that you have tens of thousands of folks from the recent wave of Central America who've disappeared. We don't know where they are. We have to send people out to find them. It's an enormous burden. And 5,000 EROs is just not enough to do it.\nWe also need to get expedited removal for illegal migrants from Central America, so you don't have a situation where you show up, you get an NTA -- a notice to appear -- and then you just sort of disappear. That also means we need to get the court backlog down; it's about 6,000 cases right now. So we need more immigration judges, and of course you need more prosecutors so you can actually put MS-13 and other cartels in jail.\nAnd, finally, we need the border wall and other border infrastructure -- sensors, towers, you name it.\nSo those are the big legislative pieces. But obviously, administratively, we talked about this in the last couple days -- Tom talk about it too -- but if you're a gang member, we're going to find you and we're going to remove you. You don't have to have to additional items on your record. If you're a gang member and you're here illegally, then you're going home. That is a major policy change, and that's one of the reasons why we're having so much success in depleting the ranks of the cartels and the gangs. But obviously we're going to need Congress in both parties to step up and provide these extra resources.\nSo that's all I have to say, and then I'll take any questions you have about this.\nQ: So, today, in Geneva, the International Organization for Migration held a briefing and said that the impact of this \"get tough\" approach, without deterrent measures, is pushing migrants, pushing illegal immigrants into more dangerous routes and actually fueling the coffers of gangs and transnational organizations. And I'm wondering if you're concerned about that as well, and if there are, sort of, initiatives that you're going to be taking that deal with deterrence in that aspect, as well.\nMR. MILLER: I would associate myself closely with the comments that Tom Homan gave at the press briefing yesterday, which is that a message of tolerance toward illegal immigration is the number-one boon to smugglers and traffickers. And we've seen the results of that over the last eight years in terms of massive human rights violations associated with the Central American migrant surge, in terms of a humanitarian catastrophe playing out across the region.\nAnd so that permissive approach, we've seen the results, and the results have been deadly and horrific. By sending a message that you won't tolerate illegal immigration, it will shut down the smugglers. We've already seen a huge increase in the price that people have to pay to get smuggled, which, in and of itself is an enormous deterrent. And Secretary Kelly has worked to go into the region and to send the message that it's not safe to come; that if you will come, you will be returned. And he's working cooperatively with the governments in the region to help make sure that message is sent to migrants. And, ultimately, that is the most humanitarian approach.\nQ: With all this focus on measures that the administration can do -- take towards immigration, has the President gotten closer to a decision on DACA?\nMR. MILLER: Right now, as you know, there's an ongoing threat of litigation about DACA. And Secretary Kelly is working with the Justice Department on dealing with that. I don't have any news to make about it today, but I would say that our administration, from a policy standpoint, remains resolutely focused on protecting jobs, wages, and security for American citizens. And when we have further announcements on that, we will make them.\nQ: Nikki Haley I think is traveling here. What is her role in this? Is she going to be giving any remarks ahead of the President? Or is she just here to, sort of, make a show about the U.N.'s role in migration?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean, in addition to any role -- and there, of course, is some with respect to the United Nations and global migration issues -- obviously, the President of the United States, at all times of the day, is working on the many different foreign policy issues facing our country, and I'm sure that they're discussing those on a variety of different fronts.\nQ: Given the challenges of healthcare, trying to get legislation through, have you given any new thought to the strategy for how you're going to get through funding for a wall, or money for new ICE agents, given that Democrats are united in opposition to that kind of legislation?\nMR. MILLER: That's a great question. That's actually -- that's a good one to end on, so I can make a really strong statement for everybody.\nIf Senate Democrats try to block the funding we need to protect our nation from criminals, drug dealers, cartels, and terrorists, it will cause an uproar from the American people. And they will pay a steep political price.\nThank you.\nEND 1:07 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-07-28", "title": "Press Gaggle by Senior Policy Advisor Stephen Miller"}

Ford, we saluted those who will defend our flag on the newest and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of our world. In Ohio, I delivered a very special award to a heroic military survivor from the Pearl Harbor attack—long ago, but he is still in great shape. At the White House, we have bestowed the Medal of Valor on the brave police officers who saved so many lives after a gunman opened fire on lawmakers during a congressional baseball practice. They were very, very brave, and they truly did save lives. And today in New York, we thanked the law enforcement officers who are going after violent criminals and MS-13 gang members and restoring safety and peace to our communities.\nAll American heroes—whether they patrol the oceans, protect our Capitol, safeguard our streets, or serve in many other ways—share a common bond: They believe in America, they love our citizens, and they will stop at nothing to defend our safety and our freedom. That is why we honor our heroes and work hard every day to build an America that is worthy of their sacrifices.\nThe source of America's strength is found in the spirit of our people. The heroes among us represent that American spirit: courage, love, and sacrifice. Our hearts are filled with pride and gratitude for all those who, for over two centuries, have secured our Nation and protected our citizens.\nThroughout our history, heroes have answered the call of duty to defend our country in its hour of need, and they're always there for us. And frankly, one of the great privileges and joys of serving as President of the United States is getting to spend time with these incredible Americans.\nOur heroes show us who we are as a nation and a people. They remind us that every citizen is capable of greatness, and they renew the promise that America will grow stronger and greater than ever before, and that's what we're doing right now. Look at all the jobs that are coming in. Look at what's happening with the stock markets. Look at so many things, where we're just getting bigger, better, and stronger. And never, ever forget our military, where we're adding billions and billions of dollars of new planes, new ships, and new equipment for our great soldiers and military personnel.\nAfter all, heroes are made in America, and we have to take care of our heroes.\nThank you and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-07-28", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Well, thank you very much. This is certainly being home for me. I spent a lot of time right here. I was in Queens, so I'd come here, and this was, like, the luxury location for me. And I love it. I love the people here. Even coming in from the airport, I sat with Nikki Haley, who's here someplace. Where's our Nikki? Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is so incredible. And she's seen crowds in her life, and she said, boy, those are really big crowds. Crowds of people all lining the streets, all the way over to here. And it's really a special place. And so when I heard about this, I said, I want to do that one.\nBut I really wanted to do it not because of location, but because, as you know, I am the big, big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement, okay? From day one. [Applause] From day one. We love our police. We love our sheriffs. And we love our ICE officers. And they have been working hard. Thank you. They have been working hard.\nTogether, we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities, and we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel, MS-13, and many other gangs. But MS-13 is particularly violent. They don't like shooting people because it's too quick, it's too fast. I was reading, one of these animals was caught and explaining, they like to knife them and cut them and let them die slowly because that way it's more painful, and they enjoy watching that much more. These are animals.\nWe're joined today by police and sheriffs from Suffolk, Nassau, Dutchess, and Ulster counties; State police from New York and New Jersey—many of you I know, great friends; Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and law enforcement personnel from a number of Federal agencies. So we're loaded up with great people, that's what I call it.\nAnd I want to just tell you all together, right now, and the reason I came—this is the most important sentence to me: On behalf of the American people, I want to say, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nAnd I don't think you know how much the public respects and admires you. You're saving American lives every day, and we have your backs—believe me—we have your backs 100 percent. Not like the old days.\nAudience member. It's about time. [Applause]\nThe President. Not like the old days. You know, when you want to take over used military equipment—and they were saying you couldn't do it—you know what I said? That was my first day: You can do it. [Laughter] In fact, that stuff is disappearing so fast we have none left. [Laughter] You guys know who to—you really knew how to get that. But that's my honor. And I tell you what, it's being put to good use.\nI especially want to thank ICE Director Tom Homan, who has done an incredible job in just a short period of time. Tom, get up here. I know you just called—[applause]. Tom is determined to rid our Nation of cartels and criminals who are preying on our citizens. And I can only say to Tom: Keep up the great work. He's a tough guy. He's a tough cookie. Somebody said the other day, they saw him on television, and somebody—they were interviewed after that; they said, he looks very nasty, he looks very mean. I said, that's what I'm looking for. [Laughter] That's exactly what I was looking for.\nAnd for that, I want to congratulate John Kelly, who has done an incredible job of Secretary of Homeland Security. Incredible. One of our real stars. Truly, one of our stars. John Kelly is one of our great stars. You know, the border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn't go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was, like, this was a great thing. Down 78 percent. And in fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a big favor, believe me. They get very little traffic in there anymore, because they know they're not going to get through the border to the United States. So that whole group has been incredible, led by General Kelly.\nLet me also express our gratitude to the members of the New York delegation here today: Congressman Chris Collins. Where's Chris? Where's Chris? Oh, Chris, right from the beginning, he said, \"Trump is going to win.\" [Laughter] \"Trump is going to win.\" So I like him. [Laughter] I didn't like him that much before; now I love him. I'll never—[laughter]. Dan Donovan—thanks, Dan. Thank you, Dan. And Lee Zeldin, who I supported right from the beginning, when they said he didn't have a chance of beating a pretty popular incumbent. And I saw him in a debate. I said, I think this guy is going to win. But he fought a pretty popular guy, and I said, I think he's going to win and went heavy for him, and he won. And he won pretty easily, didn't you? Pretty good. I'm proud of you. Great job.\nAnd of course, a legend, somebody that we all know very well, sort of my neighbor—because I consider him a neighbor—but he's really a great and highly respected man in Washington, Congressman Peter King. Peter. Very respected guy. He is a respected man that people like to ask opinions of. I do.\nCongressman King and his colleagues know the terrible pain and violence MS-13 has inflicted upon this community and this country. And if you remember, just a little more than 2 years ago, when I came down the escalator with Melania, and I made the speech—people coming into this country. Everyone said, what does he know? What's he talking about?\nAnd there was bedlam. Remember bedlam? And then, about 2 months later, they said, you know, he's right. So I'm honored to have brought it to everybody's attention. But the suffering and the pain that we were going through—and now you can look at the numbers—it's a whole different world. And it will get better and better and better, because we've been able to start nipping it in the bud. We've nipped it in the bud—let's call it start nipping in the bud.\nAnd MS-13, the cartel, has spread gruesome bloodshed throughout the United States. We've gotten a lot of them out of here. Big, big percentage. But the rest are coming; they'll be out of here quickly, right? Quickly. [Laughter] Good.\nSo I asked Tom on the plane—he was never on Air Force One—I said, how do you like it? He said, I like it. [Laughter] But I said, hey, Tom, let me ask you a question, how tough are these guys, MS-13? He said, they're nothing compared to my guys. Nothing. And that's what you need. Sometimes, that's what you need, right?\nFor many years, they exploited America's weak borders and lax immigration enforcement to bring drugs and violence to cities and towns all across America. They're there right now because of weak political leadership, weak leadership, weak policing, and in many cases, because the police weren't allowed to do their job. I've met police that are great police that aren't allowed to do their job because they have a pathetic mayor or a mayor doesn't know what's going on. [Applause]\nWere you applauding for someone in particular? [Laughter] It's sad. It's sad. [Laughter] You look at what's happening, it's sad. But hopefully—certainly in the country, those days are over. You may have a little bit longer to wait. [Laughter]\nBut from now on, we're going to enforce our laws, protect our borders, and support our police like our police have never been supported before. We're going to support you like you've never been supported before.\nFew communities have suffered worse at the hands of these MS-13 thugs than the people of Long Island. Hard to believe. I grew up on Long Island. I didn't know about this. I didn't know about this. And then, all of a sudden, this is, like, a new phenomena. Our hearts and our Nation grieve for the victims and their families.\nSince January '16—think of this—MS-13 gang members have brutally murdered 17 beautiful, young lives in this area on Long Island alone. Think of it. They butchered those little girls. They kidnap, they extort, they rape, and they rob. They prey on children. They shouldn't be here. They stomp on their victims. They beat them with clubs. They slash them with machetes, and they stab them with knives. They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields. They're animals.\nWe cannot tolerate as a society the spilling of innocent, young, wonderful, vibrant people: sons and daughters, even husbands and wives. We cannot accept this violence 1 day more. Can't do it, and we're not going to do it. Because of you, we're not going to be able to do it. You're not going to allow it to happen, and we're backing you up a hundred percent. Remember that, hundred percent.\nIt is the policy of this administration to dismantle, decimate, and eradicate MS-13 at every other—and I have to say, MS-13, that's a name; rough groups—that's fine. We've got a lot of others. And they were all let in here over a relatively short period of time. Not during my period of time, believe me. But we're getting them out. They're going to jails, and then, they're going back to their country. Or they're going back to their country, period.\nOne by one, we're liberating our American towns. Can you believe that I'm saying that? I'm talking about liberating our towns. This is like I'd see in a movie: They're liberating the town, like in the old Wild West, right? We're liberating our towns. I never thought I'd be standing up here talking about liberating the towns on Long Island where I grew up, but that's what you're doing.\nAnd I can tell you, I saw some photos where Tom's guys—rough guys. They're rough. I don't want to be—you know, say it, because they'll say that's not politically correct. You're not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work. We have to get—just like they don't want to have rich people at the head of Treasury, okay? [Laughter] Like, I want a rich guy at the head of Treasury, right? Right? [Applause] Right? I want a rich guy at the head of Commerce. Because we've been screwed so badly on trade deals, I want people that made a lot of money now to make a lot of money for our country.\nAnd by the way, as I was walking up, they just gave me the numbers. Our numbers were—just came out this morning. GDP is up double from what it was in the first quarter, 2.6 percent. We're doing well. We're doing really well. And we took off all those restrictions. And some we're statutorily stuck with a for a little while, but eventually, that statute comes up, and we're going to be able to cut a lot more. But we've sort of liberated the world of creating jobs like you're liberating us and the people that live in areas.\nBut I have to say, one by one, we are indeed freeing up these great American towns and cities that are under siege from gang violence. Look at Los Angeles. Look at what's going on in Los Angeles. Look at Chicago. What is going on? And is anybody here from Chicago? We have to send some of you to Chicago, I think. [Laughter] What's going on? I mean, you see what's happening there? There's no—do we agree? Is there something maybe—[applause]—is there something?\nI have to tell you one Chicago story. So Chicago is having this unbelievable violence; people being killed, four, five, six in a weekend. And I'm saying, what is going on? And when I was running, we had motorcycle brigades take us to the planes and stuff. And one of the guys, really good—you could see a really respected officer, police officer. He was at the head. He was the boss. And you could see he was the boss. He actually talked like the boss. \"Come on, get lined up.\"\nBecause I'd always take pictures with the police, because I did that. My guys said, don't do it. Don't do it. Other candidates didn't do it that I was beating by 40 points, can you believe it? [Laughter] But I did it. Maybe that's why I was winning by 40 points. But other candidates wouldn't do it, but I always took the pictures with the police.\nBut we're in Chicago, and we had massive motorcycle bridges, and you know those people have to volunteer. I don't know if you know that, but from what I understand, they have to volunteer. And I had the biggest brigades. I had brigades sometimes with almost 300 motorcycles. Even I was impressed. I'd look ahead, and it was nothing, but motorcycles because they'd volunteer from all over various States.\nBut this one guy was impressive. He was a rough cookie and really respected guy. I could see he was respected. And he said: \"All right, come on, get over here. Get over here. He's got to get to work. Get over here.\" And I said, \"So let me tell you—you're from Chicago?\" \"Yes, sir.\" I said, \"What the hell is going on?\" And he said, \"It's a problem can be straightened out.\" I said, \"How long would it take you to straighten out this problem?\" He said, \"If you gave me the authority, a couple of days.\" [Laughter] I really mean it. I said, \"You really think so?\" He said: \"A couple of days. We know all the bad ones. We know them all.\" And he said, the officers—you guys, you know all the bad ones in your area. You know them by their names. He said: \"We know them all. A couple of days.\"\nI said, \"You've got to be kidding.\" Now, this is a year and a half ago. I said, \"Give me your card.\" And he gave me a card. And I sent it to the mayor. I said, \"You ought to try using this guy.\" [Laughter] Guess what happened? Never heard. And last week, they had another record. It's horrible.\nBut we're just getting started. We will restore law and order on Long Island. We'll bring back justice to the United States. I'm very happy to have gotten a great, great Justice of the United States Supreme Court, not only nominated, but approved. And by the way, your Second Amendment is safe. Your Second Amendment is safe. I feel very good about that. It wasn't looking so good for the Second Amendment, was it, huh? If Trump doesn't win, your Second Amendment is gone. Your Second Amendment would be gone.\nBut I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien that are threatening so violently our people: We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you, and we will deport you. And you know, we had some problems with certain countries. Still do with a couple, but we'll take care of them, don't worry about it. Anytime we have a trade deficit, it's very easy—which is almost everywhere. We have trade deficits with almost every country, because we had a lot of really bad negotiators making deals with other countries. So it's almost everywhere, so that takes care of itself.\nBut we had certain countries in South America where they wouldn't take the people back. And I said, that's okay, no more trade. All of a sudden, they started taking their people back. It's amazing, isn't it? They used to send to the former Secretary of State of the country: \"Please call. Would you please work it so that we can take\"—and they used to just tell her, \"No, we won't take back.\" They take back with us, every single time. We're having no—we're having very little problem. Are we having any problem right now with that? Huh? You'd better believe it. Give me the names of the few problems. We'll take care of it this—I'm telling you. [Laughter] It's unbelievable.\nOne of the old people—one of the people that represented the other administration, I said, why didn't you use that, the power of economics? \"Sir, we think one thing has nothing to do with another.\" I said, oh, really? So we'll have big deficits, and they won't take back these criminals that came from there and should be back there? Well, believe me, to me, everything matters. But they're all taking them back.\nICE officers recently conducted the largest crackdown on criminal gangs in the history of our country. In just 6 weeks, ICE and our law enforcement partners arrested nearly 1,400 suspects and seized more than 200 illegal firearms and some beauties and nearly 600 pounds of narcotics.\nThe men and women of ICE are turning the tide in the battle against MS-13. But we need more resources from Congress, and we're getting them. Congress is actually opening up and really doing a job. They should have approved health care last night—[laughter]—but you can't have everything. Boy, oh, boy. They've been working on that one for 7 years. Can you believe that? The swamp. But we'll get it done. We're going to get it done.\nYou know, I said from the beginning: Let Obamacare implode and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode. Right now we have less than 6,000 enforcement and removal officers in ICE. This is not enough to protect a nation of more than 320 million people. It's essential that Congress fund another 10,000 ICE officers—and we're asking for that—so that we can eliminate MS-13 and root out the criminal cartels from our country.\nNow, we're getting them out anyway, but we'd like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon—you just see them thrown in, rough—[laughter]—I said, please don't be too nice. [Laughter] Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? Like, don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody—don't hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, okay? [Laughter]\nIt's essential that Congress fund hundreds more Federal immigration judges and prosecutors—and we need them quickly, quickly—if we're going to dismantle these deadly networks. And I have to tell you, you know, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years they've been made to protect the criminal. Totally made to protect the criminal, not the officers. You do something wrong, you're in more jeopardy than they are. These laws are stacked against you. We're changing those laws. But in the meantime, we need judges for the simplest thing, things that you should be able to do without a judge. But we have to have those judges quickly. In the meantime, we're trying to change the laws. We're also working with Chairman Bob Goodlatte on a series of enforcement measures—and he's a terrific guy—to keep our country safe from crime and terrorism and in particular, radical Islamic terrorism. A term never uttered by past administration. Never uttered. Did anybody ever hear that term? I don't think so. But you heard it from me.\nThat includes cracking down on sanctuary cities that defy Federal law, shield visa overstays, and that release dangerous criminals back into the United States communities. That's what's happening. They're releasing them. So many deaths where they release someone back into the community, and they know it's going to end that way. That's the sad—they know it's going to end that way. We're ending those procedures. [Applause] Thank you.\nWe have to secure—[applause]. Thank you. I spoke to parents, incredible parents. I got to know so many parents of children that were so horribly killed: burned to death, beaten to death, just the worst kind of death you can ever—stuffed in barrels. And the person that did it was released, and you'd look at the file, and there were letter after letter after letter of people begging not to let this animal back into society; that this would happen, it would happen quickly. It wasn't even like it would happen over a long period of time. They were saying it would happen quickly. It's total violence. He's a totally violent person. You cannot let this person out.\nThey let the person out, and sometimes, it would happen, like, on the first day. And then, you have to talk to the parents and hold the parents and hug them. And they're crying so—I mean, crying. Their lives are destroyed. And nobody thinks about those people. They don't think about those people. They're devastated.\nBut we're ending so much of that. We're ending, hopefully, all of that. The laws are tough. The laws are stacked against us, but we're ending that.\nSo we're going to secure our border against illegal entry, and we will build the wall. That I can tell you. In fact, last night—you don't read about this too much, but it was approved—$1.6 billion for the phase one of the wall, which is not only designed, but the start of construction over a period of about 2 years, but the start of construction for a great border wall. And we're going to build it. The wall is a vital and vital as a tool for ending the humanitarian disaster brought—and really brought on by drug smugglers and new words that we haven't heard too much of, human traffickers.\nThis is a term that's been going on from the beginning of time, and they say it's worse now than it ever was. You go back a thousand years where you think of human trafficking; you go back 500 years, 200 years, 100 years. Human trafficking they say—think of it, but they do—human trafficking is worse now maybe than it's ever been in the history of this world.\nWe need a wall. We also need it, though, for the drugs, because the drugs aren't going through walls very easily, especially the walls that I build. I'm a very good builder. You people know that better than most, because you live in the area. That's why I'm here. We'll build a good wall.\nNo, we're going to build a real wall. We're going to build a wall that works, and it's going to have a huge impact on the inflow of drugs coming across. The wall is almost—that could be one of the main reasons you have to have it. It's an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country.\nThe previous administration enacted an open-door policy to illegal migrants from Central America. \"Welcome in. Come in, please, please.\" As a result, MS-13 surged into the country and scoured and just absolutely destroyed so much in front of it. New arrivals came in, and they were all made recruits of each other, and they fought with each other, and then they fought outside of each other. And it got worse and worse, and we've turned that back.\nIn the 3 years before I took office, more than 150,000 unaccompanied alien minors arrived at the border and were released all throughout our country into United States communities, at a tremendous monetary cost to local taxpayers and also a great cost to life and safety.\nNearly 4,000 from this wave were released into Suffolk County—congratulations—including 7 who are now indicted for murder. You know about that. In Washington, DC, region, at least 42 alien minors from the border surge have been recently implicated in MS-13-related violence, including 19 charged in killings or attempted killings.\nYou say, what happened to the old days where people came into this country, they worked, and they worked, and they worked, and they had families, and they paid taxes, and they did all sorts of things, and their families got stronger, and they were closely knit? We don't see that.\nFailure to enforce our immigration laws had predictable results: drugs, gangs, and violence. But that's all changing now. Under the Trump administration, America is once more a nation of laws and once again a nation that stands up for our law enforcement officers. We will defend our country, protect our communities, and put the safety of the American people first. And I'm doing that with law enforcement, and we're doing that with trade, and we're doing that with so much else. It's called America first. It's called an expression I'm sure you've never heard of: make America great again. [Laughter] Has anybody heard that expression? Have you heard that? Have you heard that expression? That is my promise to each of you, that is the oath I took as President, and that is my sacred pledge to the American people.\nThank you everyone here today. You are really special, special Americans. And thank you in particular to the great police, sheriffs, and ICE officers. You do a spectacular job. The country loves you. The country respects you. You don't hear it, but believe me, they respect you as much as they respect anything there is to respect about our country. You are spectacular people.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!\nThe President. Because of the danger of your job, which people also understand fully, I leave you with the following: Thank you and may God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-07-28", "title": "Remarks to Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Officers in Brentwood, New York"}

These actions contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon and the region.\nCertain ongoing activities, such as continuing arms transfers to Hizballah that include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon, and continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

And to you, to President V?jonis, and, to President Grybauskait?, it is an honor to be with you today with the leaders of the Baltic States.\nAnd it's my great privilege to be here today to bring a very simple message from the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\nPresident Trump sent me here to: We are with you. We stand with the people and nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- and we always will.\nNext year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of freedom for all three of your nations, but for most of this past century, you had to fight to reclaim your independence and your sacred birthright of liberty.\nThe United States proudly stood with you as you labored under Communist occupation. Through all the decades, we refused to recognize the Baltic States as part of the Soviet Union.\nWhen you raised your voices in the Singing Revolution, we joined the chorus from afar for liberty. When you joined your hands in the Baltic Way, we reached out from across the world.\nAnd the people of the United States believed, with you, that the Baltic States would one day reclaim your rightful place among the community of free and sovereign nations -- and so you did.\nToday, you have achieved that goal -- and more -- by acceding to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nIt's a particular honor to be here in Estonia with the advent of your presidency of the Council of the European Union. The United States joined you in your call, in your leadership role in the EU for stronger internal security and external borders, a more robust partnership between the EU and NATO, and increased European defense spending.\nAnd as I told these three Presidents, President Trump and I applaud each of their unwavering commitment to our NATO Alliance.\nEstonia is one of only five nations to meet its obligation to spend a minimum of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense; and Latvia and Lithuania, I'm pleased to note, will meet this goal by the end of 2018.\nThe Baltic States are leading by example but are also contributing mightily to international security.\nYou're members of the Global Campaign to Defeat ISIS, and at this moment I say with gratitude, all three of your nations are participating in NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan. The people of the United States thank you and your people, and we mourn for the 14 Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian heroes who have given their lives in the cause of freedom.\nIn just a few short hours, the four of us will meet with members of the Armed Forces of the United States, Estonia, the United Kingdom, and France -- all of whom stand guard in this region through NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence initiative.\nWe stand together, here and across the world, because we know that a strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago. And no threat looms larger in the Baltic States than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east.\nAt this very moment, Russia continues to seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracies of sovereign nations, and divide the free nations of Europe -- one against another.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States of America rejects any attempt to use force, threats, intimidation, or malign influence in the Baltic States or against any of our treaty allies.\nTo be clear: We hope for better days, for better relations with Russia, but recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States of America to our security, the security of our allies, and the security of freedom-loving nations around the world.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense, and an attack on one of us is an attack on us all.\nPresident Trump also knows that security is the foundation of our prosperity, and the United States and our Baltic allies, as we discussed today, will continue to seek new and renewed ways to contribute to each other's prosperity. Our two-way trade in goods already totals more than $3.5 billion, our combined investment in each other's economies is nearly $300 million.\nBut as the four of us discussed, we have many ways to expand our economic ties, and we'll pursue them. Here in Estonia, there is a thriving start-up culture that reminds me of America; and across the region, the opportunities for greater trade and investment are almost too numerous to count.\nThe President and I were pleased to see a Lithuanian firm's recent decision to purchase liquefied natural gas from the United States. And when the first delivery occurs next month, it will benefit not only our prosperity, but it will contribute to regional security and stability. And I'm confident that this deal will only be the first of many.\nToday, the bond between the United States and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is strong -- and under President Trump, and with the leaders gathered here, I know our bond will only grow stronger as time goes on.\nOurs is a shared future of security and prosperity, ours is a shared future of freedom, and we will go forth to meet that future -- together, as allies and friends always.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-07-31", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President with Baltic Leaders in a Joint Press Availability in Tallinn, Estonia"}

But as the President has made clear, and as my presence here today demonstrates, America First does not mean America alone.\nIn my meeting earlier today with the leaders of the Baltic States, I gave them the same message that I am here to deliver to each and every one of you: The United States is with you. America stands with the nations and people of the Baltic States -- and we always will.\nWe stand with our NATO allies in our commitment to your security.\nAnd under President Trump, the United States of America stands in defense of the timeless values that unite America and Europe together in the West -- freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.\nAs the President expressed in his historic speech in Warsaw, Poland just last month, these values are in his words \"the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization.\"\nWestern civilization is a beautiful mosaic of diverse, free nations and peoples -- each with their own unique and special histories, cultures, languages and traditions -- all of which deserve to be recognized, cherished and protected.\nAnd Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are sterling examples of our civilization's vitality and commitment to freedom.\nNext year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of freedom in the Baltic States. You've clung to that birthright ever since -- even in the face of those who would take it from you.\nFor the better part of this last century, your nations were locked behind the Iron Curtain. That communist regime personified everything free peoples reject. It sought to eradicate your identity, your traditions, your language, the very essence of who you are -- the cherished ties of family and faith.\nBut through all the decades of brutal occupation, I'm proud to say the United States of America never accepted the illegitimate claims of the Soviet Union on your three Baltic States. Your perseverance inspired free nations around the world, and it was our honor to stand with you.\nIt is no coincidence or accident of history that it was right here in Tallinn that some of the very first cracks in the Iron Curtain first appeared.\nYou had preserved your memory of the past as the foundation of your future -- you kept the flame of freedom alive in your hearts.\nIt was only 30 years ago that more than 300,000 Estonians began to gather together to sing the songs of your land and your people -- as in the days of Hezekiah, the \"singers sang.\" And soon your culture and nation were renewed. Shortly thereafter, your brothers and sisters in Latvia and Lithuania joined the chorus of a Singing Revolution.\nAnd in 1989, you joined hands in the Baltic Way -- an unbroken line of unbroken will -- connecting Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius. So strong were your voices, so firm was your grip that the Soviet Union crumbled before you, and you reclaimed your freedom from the ashes of communism.\nAnd since that day, the people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, have reached out your hands in friendship to Europe and to the United States -- and today, together, we stand as one.\nThe United States and Europe are stronger together than we will ever be apart; and so it was, only 13 years ago, that we welcomed the Baltic States into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the most successful mutual-defense alliance in the history of the world.\nThe Baltic States embody the spirit of our alliance; your commitment to NATO's common defense inspires us all.\nAt the Wales Summit in 2014, every NATO member committed to move toward spending a minimum of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that every NATO member must in his words \"finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.\"\nAt this moment, I am proud to stand in the heart of one of only five NATO member nations that meets this basic standard. Estonia joins the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Poland in meeting or exceeding their obligation for our common defense. And I'm happy to report that by the end of 2018, Latvia and Lithuania will join these nations in fulfilling their promise -- and President Trump expects all of our NATO allies to follow your lead.\nThe President and I are grateful for the leadership and the example of the Baltic leaders gathered here. And to Estonia in particular, as your presidency of the Council of the European Union, know that you have the United States' full support in your call for stronger internal security in Europe, stronger external borders, a more robust partnership between the EU and NATO, and increased European defense spending.\nAt the heart of our alliance is the solemn promise that an attack on one is an attack on all. But this oath requires action -- and every NATO member must renew their commitment to our common defense -- and they must renew it now.\nA strong and united NATO is needed more today than at any point since the collapse of Communism a quarter-century ago. The adversaries we face are more numerous and sophisticated and asymmetrical than ever before.\nIn this age, once-distant threats have become local threats to nations and communities across the world -- and so all free nations must band together to confront and overcome them.\nAs we speak, our alliance is taking the fight to radical Islamic terrorism on our terms, on their soil -- and we will not rest and we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source -- so it can no longer threaten our people, our allies, or our sacred gift of freedom.\nThe Baltic States are members of the Global Campaign to Defeat ISIS, and the United States and our people are grateful for your action. And all three of your nations are participating in NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan, where our citizens have served together and sacrificed for many years.\nThe people of the United States mourn the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian citizens who have given their lives in the cause of freedom. They are heroes, and their names will always be enshrined in the hearts of the American people.\nBut terrorism is not the only adversary we face. Just last week, our alliance and all the world saw the grave and growing threat posed by the missile capabilities of dangerous regimes in North Korea and Iran.\nBoth regimes conducted provocative launches over a 24-hour span. Their actions have brought them closer to threatening our partners in their regions, our transatlantic alliance, and the American homeland itself.\nIn these times of widening threats and provocations, we will stand together in defense of our alliance and all we hold dear. We all have a vital role to play -- for all nations in this alliance loom large in the tapestry of freedom. America has no small allies.\nToday we stand where East meets West, on a great frontier of freedom. And no threat looms larger in the Baltic States than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east.\nAt this very moment, Russia continues to seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine the democracies of sovereign nations, and divide the free nations of Europe one against another.\nPresident Trump has called on Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and to cease its support for hostile regimes like North Korea and Iran.\nAnd under President Trump, the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable for its actions -- and we call on our European allies and friends to do the same.\nIn a sign of our commitment, very soon, President Trump will sign legislation to strengthen and codify the United States' sanctions against Russia.\nThe preference of the United States is a constructive relationship with Russia based on cooperation on common interests. Russia, too, has said that they would like to normalize relations with the United States. Regrettably, last week Russia took the drastic step of limiting the United States' diplomatic presence in their nation.\nPresident Trump has made it clear: America is open to a better relationship with Russia. But the President and our Congress are unified in our message: A better relationship and the lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions that caused sanctions to be imposed in the first place.\nWe hope for better days and better relations with Russia, but as I said earlier today, recent diplomatic actions taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States to our security, that of our allies, and to freedom-loving nations around the world.\nBe assured: The United States rejects any attempt to use force, threats, intimidation, or malign influence in the Baltic States or against any of our treaty allies -- and under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will stand firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense -- and the presence of the U.S Armed Forces here today proves it.\nAs the President said in Poland, we have demonstrated our commitment to the common defense not with mere words, as he said, \"but with actions.\"\nSimply look at the United States' leadership role in the Enhanced Forward Presence initiative, the one that brings us here today.\nThe Enhanced Forward Presence is the largest reinforcement of our alliance's collective defense in a generation.\nHere, United Kingdom and French troops stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Estonian forces. To the South, in Latvia and Lithuania, Germany and Canada have taken on leadership roles in additional battlegroups. And the United States proudly leads the combat-ready battlegroup stationed nearby in Poland.\nBut the United States' commitment does not rest solely with this initiative. We have deployed a full armored brigade combat team to Central and Eastern Europe through the European Reassurance Initiative.\nAnd American forces throughout the region are conducting visible exercises with our allies and partners, such as BALTOPS and Saber Strike.\nOur actions firmly demonstrate our unwavering resolve -- and they enhance our alliance's ability to stand firmly for freedom and face any scenario.\nUnder the leadership of President Trump, the United States will make the strongest fighting force in the history of the world even stronger. As the President said only a few days ago, \"American might is second to none -- and we're getting bigger, and better, and stronger every day.\" And the world knows it.\nThe President has already signed the largest increase in military spending in nearly a decade. And we've called on Congress to pass one of the largest investments in defense spending since the days of the Cold War.\nAnd so today, the United States calls on all our allies, and all who cherish freedom, to rededicate themselves to strengthening our alliance and our commitment to this cause. We must, all of us, be strong in arms. We must, all of us, be strong in our resolve. But most of all, we must be strong in our conviction that our cause is just and that freedom at the heart of our way of life is worth defending.\nIn these times of widening challenges, President Trump has powerfully also reminded us that our fight in his words \"begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls.\"\nSo let us steel our minds, strengthen our wills, and refresh our souls -- for if we do, as our President Trump promised, \"the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive, our civilization will triumph.\"\nThis, then, is our cause. It is why NATO exists. It is why Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have united with Europe. And it's why the United States stands with you -- today and always.\nThe United States is now and will always be your greatest ally and your surest friend.\nAnd I have faith -- faith that our alliance will grow stronger and our friendship will deepen because I have faith that we do not walk alone.\nIn these times of greater challenges, I urge the people of Estonia and the Baltic States, and all who cherish freedom, to have that faith.\nFor as the Old Book tells us: \"Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\"\nMy friends, ours is a shared future -- a future of security, a future of prosperity -- and ours is a shared future of freedom united in this great \"community of nations,\" together in the West.\nAnd so today I say with confidence: With the courage of the people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; with the partnership of all of our allies; with Armed Forces of the United States of America and with our Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump; and with firm reliance on Almighty God; I know the future of freedom in these lands and around the world is brighter than ever before -- and we will meet that future together.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. And God bless the United States of America.

SANDERS: Good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to bring up National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to discuss the administration's response to the Maduro regime's recent anti-democratic actions in Venezuela.\nThey will each make opening remarks and then take your questions on the topic at hand. And then as always -- your favorite time of day -- I'll come back up and take your questions. Thank you.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I thought it might be best just to read the President's statement:\nSince President Trump's inauguration, the Trump administration has called on Venezuela's Maduro regime to respect Venezuela's constitution, respect the role and authorities of the constitutionally-established National Assembly, hold free and fair elections, address the humanitarian needs of the Venezuelan people, release political prisoners, and stop oppressing its great people.\nThe regime has refused to heed this call, and his recent actions culminating in yesterday's outrageous seizure of absolute power through the sham election of the National Constituent Assembly represent a very serious blow to democracy in our hemisphere.\nMaduro is not just a bad leader, he is now a dictator. The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of this oppression. We will work with our partners to hold accountable all those responsible for the escalating violence and ongoing human rights violations.\nThe President promised strong and swift actions if the regime went forward with imposing the National Constituent Assembly on the Venezuelan people, and he will keep that promise.\nSecretary Mnuchin.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you, General. Today, the United States is broadening its effort to address the ongoing assault on Venezuela's democratic institutions by the Maduro regime.\nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, has sanctioned the President of Venezuela, Nicolбs Maduro Moros. As a result of today's sanctions, all assets of Maduro subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with him.\nAs President Trump said earlier this month, the strong and courageous actions by the Venezuelan people to stand for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law have been continually ignored by Nicolбs Maduro, who dreams of becoming a dictator. Yesterday's illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people. The National Constituent Assembly aspires, illegitimately, to usurp the constitutional role of democratically-elected National Assembly, rewrite the constitution, and impose an authoritarian regime on the people. As such, it represents a rupture in Venezuela's constitutional and democratic order.\nBy sanctioning Maduro, the United States makes clear our opposition to the policies of his regime and the support for the people of Venezuela, who strive to return their country to a full and prosperous democracy. As the country's head of state, Maduro is directly responsible for Venezuela's descent and for the destruction of democracy. Adding Maduro to OFAC's list of specially-designated nationals reflects our commitment to not stand by idly as Venezuela continues to crumble under the regime's abuses.\nWe hope that these sanctions will make all Maduro regime officials reconsider how their actions have affected their country. These actions highlight the high cost and personal recriminations enablers of this regime could face if they continue their reckless and undemocratic activities. Anyone who participates in this illegitimate ANC could be exposed to future U.S. sanctions for their role in undermining democratic process and institutions in Venezuela.\nNow we'll take a few questions.\nQ: Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. If these sanctions don't work, what would the next step be? And I guess, General McMaster, a question to you. Have we ruled out, or is anything on the table, other than economic sanctions?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say, I said this generally: We very much believe that sanctions do work, and we will continue to monitor the situation and consider additional sanctions.\nQ: And to General McMaster?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: The President has prioritized, really, his concern for the Venezuelan people. And so he's only considering those options which would benefit directly the Venezuelan people.\nQ: Thank you very much. How many times has OFAC sanctioned a head of state before? And does Maduro have any assets in the U.S.?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I can't comment on his assets, and this will be the fourth head of state.\nQ: I have two questions. One on the sanctions and another one about the election yesterday. And about the election, I want to know if you see the election as an attempt by Nicolбs Maduro to consolidate power and dismiss election next year. And also, some say -- especially the opposition and also the Washington Post editorial board say that the Venezuelan regime is on the direction of a coup -- is moving to the direction of a coup. Does the American government fear there is a coup underway in Venezuela?\nAnd then a question on Sessions, I ask it after.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, what we're seeing in Venezuela is not a coup. What we're seeing is the brutal oppression of the Venezuelan people. And so it's clear if you contrast the turnout from the opposition referendum to the very low numbers of the turnout during this farce associated with the constituent assembly, I think you see what the true desires of the Venezuelan people are.\nQ: Okay. Can I --\nQ: Thank you, sir. Actually, this is goes to either or both of you. How is this different from what happened in Turkey when President Erdogan also seized -- expanded powers in a referendum that some considered to have questionable results? You know, President Trump congratulated President Erdogan on that, and he later came to the U.S. and his people beat protestors in front of his embassy. What's the difference?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, I mean, one difference is, is you see the end of the constitution of Venezuela. And this is happening obviously at an accelerated pace in recent months, in the Maduro regime. But this is a process that has taken, really, two regimes to really restrict Venezuelan democracy. And by designating Maduro himself, he joins a very exclusive club -- including Mr. Mugabe, Bashar al-Assad, and Kim Jong-un in terms of the brutal repression of his people and, in this case, the abrogation of the constitution with the constitution -- with the constituent assembly.\nQ: Is the administration contemplating any action at the U.N. Security Council in terms of multilateral sanctions against the Maduro regime?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I think as we've said before, this President is not going to advertise what he's going to do in the future. So all options are on the table and we will consider everything.\nQ: Have you spoken to other allies of the U.S. in terms of punishing the Maduro regime? General, can you please answer that?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I'm sorry, what was the question?\nQ: Have you spoken to any other American allies about the issue of punishing the Maduro regime?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: You've seen the President's statement; he said that we're going to continue to work with our partners in the region. And there have been many leaders who have taken a very important role in this connection with trying to engage Maduro to get him to moderate his behavior, to get him to protect the rights of his people. As you know, the Organization of American States has tried very hard in this area as well. And so the President is committed to working with partners in the region on behalf of the Venezuelan people.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: And we've had several countries last week join us in our previous sanctions.\nYes, right here.\nQ: What conversations, Secretary Mnuchin, have you had or has the administration had or the President had with President Maduro or anybody at the senior level of Venezuela? Do you expect those conversations to happen over the next 24 or 48 hours?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think we're not going to comment on that.\nQ: You had said before -- pardon me, the President had promised strong and swift economic sanctions. This is not really economic, this is more individual. Will the President carry out strong and swift economic sanctions?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, we had a series of sanctions last week. This is an additional sanction today. We don't comment on future sanctions, but we will continue to monitor the situation and determine what's appropriate.\nRight here.\nQ: There was some talk of maybe making some changes in terms of our export of light crude oil to Venezuela or curbing Venezuelan oil imports. Is that still on the table, or is that something that would be seen as hurting the Venezuelan people?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me just say, as we continue to monitor this situation, we will continue to review all of our options. Our objective is not to do anything that hurts the people of Venezuela. But let me just say, we will continue to monitor all of our specific options.\nQ: And would sanctions against oil hurt the Venezuelan people?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not going to comment on that. What I will say is, we will monitor all of our options.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Sixteen years ago, Secretary Powell signed an agreement in South America in which the U.S. completely ruled out support of coups that would have an indirect change of government throughout Latin America, and supported direct succession. This occurred in Haiti when President Aristide was overthrown. Are you still abiding by the agreement Secretary Powell signed, and ruling out and U.S. support of a coup or of an uprising against the Maduro regime that brings in new leadership?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I'm just going to comment on -- we are focused on the democratic process, and that's what we're focused on right now.\nOne more question. Right here, one more question.\nQ: Yes, are there going to be sanctions on the Minister of Defense or people linked to the military?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, as I've said, we've announced sanctions, we will continue to monitor the situation, and consider everything in the future. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it.\nMS. SANDERS: You guys wasted all your questions on the same one over and over. Just kidding. Tough crowd today.\nI know it's a little late than we're used to doing the briefing, so I'll just have a few updates before I get to your questions.\nI wanted to make sure you were all aware that last week the First Lady announced that she will lead the United States delegation in support of the more than 90 American athletes competing at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada this September. As the President often says, there is no better representative for the United States than the First Lady, and he's very proud to have her leading the team that will support these American athletes. The First Lady is very much looking forward to her first solo international trip, and her office is available to answer any questions you may have.\nAs you know, the Vice President is overseas on a three-country visit to Eastern Europe. He spent the last few days in Estonia, attending meetings and speaking to the multinational troops participating in the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence Mission, where he recognized Estonia as one of only five NATO member states that meets its defense spending obligations.\nEarlier today, the Vice President and Second Lady arrived in Georgia, where they attended a dinner hosted by the Prime Minister. And as the Vice President continues to strengthen our relationships with our friends and allies in Europe during his travels, here at home the Departments of Commerce and Energy welcomes news of a partnership between American energy and the government of Ukraine.\nUkraine's state-owned power generation company will purchase American thermos coal ahead of the upcoming winter season. This partnership will provide Ukraine with a secure, reliable, and competitive alternative energy source, helping to stabilize an energy supply which has historically been at the mercy of the country's volatile neighbors.\nThis announcement will also boost our own economy, supporting jobs in the coal and transportation industries. As the Trump administration continues to move our country down the path of energy dominance, we hope to see more mutually beneficial partnerships like these in the future.\nAnd lastly, I know we all saw the ceremony that just ended in the East Room, and Specialist Five McCloughan was in -- at the stakes afterwards, but I think his heroic story bears repeating again. For 48 harrowing hours of close combat fighting in Vietnam, he voluntarily risked his life multiple times to protect his comrades. Even after shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade slashed open the back of his body from head to foot, he continued to answer the pleas of his fellow soldiers, even carrying one to safety on his own badly injured back.\nAs one of his comrades recalled, the medic could count on him. The President was honored to award him with the Medal of Honor today, officially adding his name to the list of American heroes who will stand forever in our history for their bravery and unbreakable spirit.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nQ: Sarah --\nQ: What happened, Sarah? What happened? (Laughter.)\nMS. SANDERS: This is kind of fun. How long will you yell? Just kidding.\nJen, go ahead.\nQ: Can you say, is Anthony Scaramucci still in the administration? Does he have another role now, besides Communications Director? And can you talk a little bit about the circumstances of his departure this morning?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. He does not have a role at this time in the Trump administration. And we put out a statement earlier, announcing that. And I don't have much else to add.\nQ: He's not at the Ex-Im Bank?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at this time.\nQ: Can you say -- did General Kelly ask him to leave? Or did the President ask him to leave? Did he volunteer his resignation? Or how did that come about?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the process tick-tock. Look, as we've said several times before, what matters most to us is not who's employed in the White House, but who's employed in the rest of the country. And we're focused on the President's agenda of growing the economy, creating jobs. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what we're going to be focused on.\nJohn.\nQ: Sarah, was it a chain of command issue? Because Scaramucci said that he had a direct line of communication with the President. Now, there's been some speculation that General Kelly may try to tighten up the number of inputs that the President has. So was it something about the chain of command? Or did it have anything to do with that interview that Scaramucci had last week?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President certainly felt that Anthony's comments were inappropriate for a person in that position. And he didn't want to burden General Kelly also with that line of succession. As I think we've made clear a few times over the course of the last couple of days to several of you individually, but General Kelly has the full authority to operate within the White House, and all staff will report to him.\nQ: When you say he didn't want to burden him with that line of succession, you mean the chain of command?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, correct.\nQ: And if we could just clarify one point about this chain of command. Apparently, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have said they look forward to following General Kelly's lead. When it comes to the people who have access to the President, will that conduit be narrowed down now? Will everything flow through Kelly, or will some things still flow around the Chief of Staff's office?\nMS. SANDERS: As I just said, the President has given full authority to General Kelly, and he'll make those determinations.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, this statement that was released by the White House says Mr. Scaramucci felt that it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team, but you just said the President felt that his comments were inappropriate.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't see those as being mutually exclusive. I think Anthony wants General Kelly to be able to operate fully with a clean slate, build his own team, while at the same time, the President felt his comments were inappropriate. Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.\nQ: And a follow-up to that. With the new hierarchy with General Kelly, tell us what it looks like in this administration.\nMS. SANDERS: As we've laid out, General Kelly I think will bring new structure to the White House and discipline and strength. And we're all really excited to work with him. And in terms of -- I'm not going to draw out an org chart up here, but we'll keep you guys posted as --\nQ: So Steve Bannon, Kellyanne, everyone reports under him instead of going straight to the President with issues? Does every special assistant go to General Kelly first?\nMS. SANDERS: I think I've been clear that General Kelly has the full authority to carry out business as he sees fit.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. A real quick one first. I have two for you. A real quick one; it regards Sean Spicer. Will he be in the administration in any way now that Anthony Scaramucci has announced that he will not be a part of the Trump administration?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any changes that have been made on that front.\nQ: And then, my second one is this: Ten days ago, Anthony Scaramucci was introduced as the new White House Communications Director. Ten days later, he's out of a job. The President announced on Twitter that there's no chaos at the White House. How would you describe what has happened over the course of the past 10 days? Obviously, you will agree with your boss, the President, that there's no chaos. But how do you explain that not to be the case?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's pretty simple. I've said it before: If you want to see chaos, come to my house with three preschoolers. This doesn't hold a candle to that.\nQ: Does the President --\nMS. SANDERS: Just to be clear, that's not an open invitation to come to my house. (Laughter.) But if you guys want to schedule babysitting time, I'll be happy to work that out.\nQ: Does the President regret hiring Anthony Scaramucci?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into anything beyond what I've already said on that front.\nQ: You said you don't want to get into the process, but you already did. The statement says that Scaramucci \"felt,\" so you're basically laying this on him. You're saying that it was his decision. Was it his decision?\nMS. SANDERS: I think I've been pretty clear that the President felt it was inappropriate. Both Anthony and General Kelly also, I think, came to a mutual agreement. And we're moving forward to focus on the jobs outside of this building, not within it.\nQ: Two questions. One on this, and then a different topic. Just to clarify, because I want to make sure I understand the word \"he\" here, who this refers to. You said a minute ago, \"he\" didn't want to burden General Kelly also with that line of succession. The \"he\" there --\nMS. SANDERS: The President.\nQ: That's the President. So you were saying that it's the President who is deciding that --\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we all serve at the pleasure of the President, but I think that this was a mutually-agreed conversation that took place between several people.\nSteven.\nQ: And then the other topic --\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, sorry, the other topic.\nQ: Just on Russia and Russia sanctions. Do you know whether the President has, or intends to soon, sign the Russia sanctions bill? And why hasn't the President taken the opportunities he's had today -- several public opportunities -- to say something in response to Vladimir Putin's retaliation with the 755 diplomats?\nMS. SANDERS: So we put out a statement over the weekend stating the President's intent to sign, and we'll let you know when that takes place.\nQ: Will that happen today?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we'll let you know when that's going to happen.\nAnd in terms of your second question? The follow-up was -- I'm sorry.\nQ: Why hasn't he taken the opportunity to say something forceful to President Putin? I mean, I've talked to folks today who said it's kind of striking the silence from the President, with no sort of response out of his own mouth. He has a couple of opportunities today to say something about it, and he didn't.\nMS. SANDERS: Right now we're reviewing our options. And when we have something to say on it, we'll let you know.\nQ: Not to beat a dead horse, but to go back to April's question --\nMS. SANDERS: Why not? That's our favorite thing to do.\nQ: -- you said earlier, all staff will report to the new Chief of Staff. Does that include Jared Kushner? Does that include Steve Bannon? Everyone reports to Kelly?\nMS. SANDERS: That includes everybody at the White House.\nQ: Okay. And then I want to also ask on just a question about tax reform. Will the administration absolutely support the version of tax overhaul that comes out of the Ways and Means Committee?\nMS. SANDERS: We're working hand in glove with -- we put out a joint statement with the Big Six. We'll continue working with them and announce details as they come forward.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. When Sean Spicer resigned, it was for a clean slate. Now that Anthony Scaramucci resigned, that's also for a clean slate. Has the slate been totally cleaned at this point? (Laughter.) Can we expect any more staff shakeups? Everybody else in senior staff positions is planning to remain for this time?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, they are.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two very brief questions. Is there any chance you will just leave the job of communications director alone, having had two people who held it leave rather abruptly, in both cases?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll let you know when we have any personnel announcements to make on that front.\nQ: The other thing I wanted to ask was, when the President made his speech to police officers on Friday, almost within minutes, statements came from police chiefs across the country criticizing his remarks that seemed to endorse the use of force by police in certain arrests. Was the President joking when he said this, or did he check his remarks out with the International Association of Police Chiefs or maybe the Attorney General?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe he was making a joke at the time.\nTrey.\nQ: So to be clear -- because the statement says that Anthony Scaramucci is no longer with the administration -- was Scaramucci fired by the President, or was he asked to resign?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get into anything beyond what I've already said on that.\nQ: Quick follow-up from the President's perspective. You said this was a back-and-forth conversation. Can you take us through a little bit of what the President is looking for in his communications shop -- why he might make this decision to make a clean slate?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that he wants to work with General Kelly and the communications team that is intact right now, and determine what the best course forward is at this point.\nQ: Are reports that Attorney General Sessions is being considered for Homeland Security chief accurate? How soon will that search be complete? How essential is it for the White House to fill that in a quick manner?\nMS. SANDERS: There are no conversations about any Cabinet members moving in any capacity, and the President has 100 percent confidence in all members of his Cabinet.\nHallie.\nQ: Two questions for you. One, on the Scaramucci issue -- you said the President found his remarks inappropriate. Obviously, the President is not a stranger to salty language. Can you specify what exactly he found inappropriate or disturbing about that?\nMS. SANDERS: I said he found it inappropriate for a person in that position.\nQ: To do what?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe the comments that he made, he found those comments inappropriate. I'm not sure what's unclear.\nQ: Okay. Is it is a betrayal, sort of, of the rest of the staff? I'm just trying to find out, because you talk about the messaging being important for the President here, and obviously the head of the communications department is crucial to that effort. So just trying to figure out what exactly went wrong between this morning, when Scaramucci was here, and this afternoon.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I don't think that it's complicated to understand that the President felt the comments were inappropriate. I can't really explain it any further than that. I'm not sure what's hard.\nQ: On North Korea, obviously, events over the weekend have unfolded. There has been some discussion from outside analysts who are increasingly speculating about the possibility of a first strike. Is that an option on the table for this White House?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, the President is not going to broadcast any decisions, but all options are on the table.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. The President, the week before last, signed an executive order on infrastructure. Does that mean that the President has no -- not an intention, but is not going to prioritize working with Congress on the infrastructure bill? Is there any discussion at this point of moving forward on any sort of legislative plans for infrastructure, especially digital, since he mentioned in Iowa --\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. The President has been very outspoken on the need for a massive overhaul to the country's infrastructure system, and that's certainly still a priority both legislative and in any capacity that he has the ability to carry that out.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Just kind of big picture here: We've seen the Chief of Staff, the Deputy Chief of Staff, handful of communications directors, a press secretary, the national security advisor all leave in the first six months of this administration. Can you tell us a little bit about why there's been all this turbulence? I know you don't like to get into the process, but just -- all of those things together, what's going on?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we're continuing to focus on the President's agenda. We're going to have staff changes. We let you guys know when they happen. But like I said earlier, what matters to us are not the jobs that are within this building, but the ones outside of there. That's why the President has been so focused on growing jobs. We've created over a million new jobs since he took office; the lowest unemployment in the last 16 years. Consumer confidence is at an all-time high. We're focused on creating a strong economy and growing jobs outside of this building, not focused on the ones within. We're going to continue to do that.\nQ: If I may, a quick follow-up on healthcare.\nMS. SANDERS: Sure.\nQ: Mick Mulvaney said the White House doesn't want any votes in the Senate until they're voting on healthcare. With John McCain out, Pence out of the country, they don't appear likely to vote on healthcare. And you guys are also pushing for the confirmation of some nominees. Is it the White House position that they will accept the Senate voting on non-healthcare things over the next few weeks and months?\nMS. SANDERS: We're continuing to push forward, hopefully, with the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. We've never been shy about that, and we're going to continue to do that.\nAlexis.\nQ: The President's legislative affairs director was talking today at the Newseum about the President's tax reform ambitions. And I wanted to ask if you could elaborate on the President's hope to travel in August to begin talk about tax cuts and tax reforms, and his interest in maybe getting some Democratic senators interested in supporting legislation. Do you have any details that you could supply about where he might go and the message he wants to impart?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at this time, but certainly we'll make sure we keep you guys posted on the President's travel and schedule throughout August. I know he does hope to have a large amount of support for tax reform. It's something that is vital to our economy, and something certainly the administration is very focused on and has been. And we'll continue working both with the House and Senate as well as members of the administration.\nWe're cutting a little close on time. Thanks so much, guys.\nEND 4:30 P.M.

We're having a Cabinet meeting.\nThe President's Accomplishments/National Economy\nQ. Mr. President, how do you expect things will be different under General Kelly's tenure?\nThe President. Well, I think we've done very well. We've done very well. Lots of records. Lots of records created, John.\nYou look at stock markets, the highest it's ever been. Unemployment, lowest in 17 years. Companies are doing tremendously well. Business spirit is the highest it's ever been according to polls—if you look at the polls—the highest it's ever been in the history of these polls.\nWe're doing very well. We have a tremendous base. We have a tremendous group of support. The country is optimistic. And I think the General will just add to it. But the country is doing very well. Strongest stock market ever. On Friday, we hit the highest in the history of the stock market. Business is very enthusiastic. And we will proceed, and we will keep going.\nBut we have a fantastic leader, Chief of Staff.

In his remarks, he referred to Chief of Staff Kelly in his former capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security; and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126718", "text": "The President. Good morning. This is our first Cabinet meeting with General Kelly. He will be Chief of Staff, as you know. We all know him, we respect him, admire what he's done. And at Homeland, what he has done has been nothing short of miraculous. As you know, the border was a tremendous problem and now close to 80 percent stoppage. And even the President of Mexico called me; they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they're not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment. So I just want to congratulate him on the great job he's done with Homeland Security, and I have no doubt that he will be an absolutely superb Chief of Staff.\nWe were discussing a little while ago, before the meeting, how well we're doing, however. We have the highest stock market in history. We have a GDP, on Friday—it got very little mention, although I guess in the business areas it did. But it got, I think, very little mention; 2.6 is a number that nobody thought they'd see for a long period of time. Remember, I was saying we will hit 3 at some point in the not-too-distant future, and everybody smiled, and they laughed, and they thought we'd be at 1. And 2.6 is an unbelievable number, announced on Friday.\nUnemployment is the lowest it's been in 17 years. Business enthusiasm is about as high as they've ever seen it. In fact, it is as high—the highest point in 28 years according to a certain graph and a certain chart. The manufacturers are—the enthusiasm level is incredible. We have a lot of tremendous things going. We have some interesting situations that we'll handle: North Korea, Middle East, lots of problems that we inherited from previous administrations. But we'll take care of them. We'll take care of them very well.\nBut overall, I think we're doing incredibly well. The economy is doing incredibly well and many other things. So we're starting from a really good base. I predict that General Kelly will go down, in terms of the position of Chief of Staff, one of the great ever. And we're going to have a good time, but much more importantly, we're going to work hard, and we're going to make America great again. It's all about making America great again. That's what we're going to do. That's what I said. That's how we won this big election. And that's what we're in the process of doing and continuing.\nAnd, General, it's really great to have you on board, and thank you very much.\nWhite House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Mr. President, what more can you do about North Korea, sir?\nThe President.

Clark, Michael Snyder, Joseph Middendorf, Kent Nielsen, Robert Pace, Charles Matthew, Michael Martino, and Orestes Trush, soldiers who served in Vietnam with Spc. 5 McCloughan.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126721", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. Please be seated. Thank you, Chaplain Hurley. Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Mattis, Secretary Shulkin, Senator Stabenow, Congressman Upton, and members of the Armed Forces: Thank you for joining us as we award our Nation's highest military honor to Specialist 5 James C. McCloughan.\nToday we pay tribute to a veteran who went above and beyond the call of duty to protect our comrades, our country, and our freedom.\nJoining Jim today is his wife Cherie, his brothers Mike and Tom, his sons Jamie and Matt, and many other members of his very large and beautiful family.\nWe're also gratified to be joined by eight previous Medal of Honor recipients. Now, Jim's name will stand forever alongside theirs in our history and in our hearts. I want to take a few minutes to tell you about Jim and how he earned this place among legends.\nJim was raised in Bangor, Michigan. His father built their house from scratch and worked 40 years at a piano factory. Jim's dad taught him a simple, but powerful lesson: Never do anything halfway. Always do your best. Jim took that lesson very much to heart. He played for four varsity sports in high school and three in college.\nIn August of 1968, Jim was drafted into the Army. Within 6 months, he was trained as a medic and arrived in Vietnam. Right away, Jim poured all of himself into his duties treating the sick and the wounded. Before long, all his fellow soldiers called him \"Doc.\"\nOn May 13, 1969, less than 3 months after he arrived, Jim was one of 89 men in Charlie Company to embark on a mission to secure a transportation route near Nui Yon. As Jim and his men jumped out of the helicopter, it quickly became clear that they were surrounded by enemy troops. Within minutes, two choppers were shot down, and one of his men was badly wounded in the middle of an open field.\nJim did not hesitate. He blazed through 100 meters of enemy fire to carry the wounded and the soldier to safety. But this was only the first of many heroic deeds Jim would perform over the next 48 hours.\nAfter tending to the first wounded soldier, Jim joined a mission to advance toward the enemy, and advance they did. Before long, they were ambushed. Again, he ran into danger to rescue his men. As he cared for two soldiers, shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade slashed open the back of Jim's body from head to foot.\nYet that terrible wound didn't stop Jim from pulling those two men to safety, nor did it stop him from answering the plea of another wounded comrade and carrying him to safety atop his own badly injured body. He was badly injured.\nAnd so it went, shot after shot, blast upon blast. As one of his comrades recalled, whoever called \"medic\" could immediately count on McCloughan. He's a brave guy. As day turned to dusk, nearly all of those who could and really, really had to make it back, they were finally within their night defensive position, except for one soldier whose plea Jim could not ignore.\nAgain, Doc did not hesitate. He crawled through a rice paddy thick with steel rain. That means bullets all over the place. As soldiers watched him, they were sure that was the last time they would see Doc. They thought that was the end of their friend, Jim.\nBut after several minutes passed, Jim emerged from the smoke and fire carrying yet another soldier. He immediately badgered [bandaged; White House correction.] and fixed and worked, but he got the wounds fixed and lifted the soldier to a medevac helicopter.\nHis lieutenant ordered Jim to get in, too. \"Get in,\" he said, \"get in.\" But Jim refused. He said, \"You're going to need me here.\" As Jim now says, \"I would have rather died on the battlefield than know that men died because they did not have a medic.\"\nOver the next 24 hours, Jim fired at enemy soldiers, suffered a bullet wound to his arm, and continued to race into gunfire to save more and more lives. And yet, as night approached again, after nearly 2 days of no food, no water, and no rest, Jim volunteered to hold a blinking light in an open field to signal for a supply drop. He would not yield, he would not rest, he would not stop, and he would not flinch in the face of sure death and definite danger.\nThough he was thousands of miles from home, it was as if the strength and pride of our whole Nation was beating inside of Jim's heart. Jim did what his father had taught him: He gave it his all, and then he just kept giving.\nIn those 48 hours, Jim rescued 10 American soldiers and tended to countless others. He was one of 32 men who fought until the end. They held their ground against more than 2,000 enemy troops.\nJim, I know I speak for every person here when I say that we are in awe of your actions and your bravery. But let me tell you one thing, and one more story about Jim. On the second day of that bloody fight, Jim found a few soldiers and a fellow soldier who had been shot badly in the stomach. He knew the soldier wouldn't make it if he flung him on the back, so he lifted him up and carried him in his arms.\nAs Jim was carrying the soldier, a thought flashed through his mind. Although Jim had always been very close to his father, he realized that it was not since he had been a young boy that he had told his dad those three very simple but beautiful words: \"I love you.\"\nIn that moment, Jim offered up a prayer. He asked God, \"If you get me out of this hell on Earth so I can tell my dad I love him, I'll be the best coach and the best father you could ever ask for.\" As he prayed, a great peace came over him. And if it was God's will for him to live, he'd keep his promise to God as soon as he had the chance.\nJim made it out of that hell on Earth. He made it; here he is. And the first thing he did when he arrived back on American soil was to say those beautiful words: \"I love you, Dad. I love you.\" Jim said those words over and over again for the next 22 years until the last time he saw his father, the night before his dad passed on. Today, I'd venture to say his dad is the proudest father in heaven. Jim fought with all of the love and courage in his soul. He was prepared to lay down his life so his brothers-in-arms could live theirs.\nWith us today are 10 of the men who fought alongside Jim, and 5 of those he saved. To Bill, Randy, Mike, Joe, Kent, Robert, John, Charles, Michael, Orestes: thank you for your service and your sacrifice. Stand up wherever you may be. Where are you? Where are you? Thank you, fellas. That's great.\nFor over two centuries, our brave men and women in uniform have overcome tyranny, fascism, communism, and every threat to our freedom—every single threat they've overcome. And we've overcome these threats because of titans like Jim whose spirit could never be conquered.\nThat's what this award is, and Jim's life represents so well: America's unbreakable spirit. It's been 48 years since Jim's battle in Vietnam. He is now a husband, a father, and a grandfather. He coached high school football, wrestling, and baseball for 38 years, just like he said he would. And he brought together every member he could find of his beloved Charlie Company.\nTo many people in this room, Specialist 5 McCloughan has always been their friend, \"Jim.\" To others, he's been \"Coach.\" To those who bravely served with him in Vietnam, he's still called their \"Doc.\" To his parents Scotty and Marguerite, both watching from heaven, he will always be their son. But today, [to; White House correction.] 320 million grateful American hearts, Private McCloughan carries one immortal title—and that title is \"hero.\"\nSpecialist 5 McCloughan: We honor you. We salute you. And with God as your witness, we thank you for what you did for all of us.\nNow I would like the military aide to come forward and read the citation.\n[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Ginny R. Nadolny, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Ricardo A. Turner, USA, Army Aide to the President. Following the presentation of the medal, Maj. Gen. Paul K. Hurley, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer.]\nThe President. Jim, thank you. God bless you. God bless your family. God bless the United States of America. Thank you, Jim.", "timestamp": "2017-07-31", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Medal of Honor to Specialist 5 James C. McCloughan"}
