Mike Pence\nOn Tuesday, the eyes of the nation will focus on Indiana as Hoosiers head to the polls to play a critical role in the selection of candidates vying to serve as the next president of the United States. It has been a true joy to watch the people of our state play host to candidates from both parties and for Hoosiers of all backgrounds and beliefs to share their thoughts about the future of this great nation. To lead is to choose and this is our state's time for choosing.\nI had the pleasure to meet with all three candidates running for the Republican nomination and to hear their plans for America. We discussed the great progress taking place in Indiana's economy and how our state needs a partner in the White House.\n…\nIn making my decision to support Ted, I am guided by the principles best espoused by former President Ronald Reagan. I am a Reagan Republican; drawn to his vision of less taxes, less government, traditional values and a strong military. Ted articulates that same agenda with an unwavering devotion to our Constitution, the sanctity of life, and the freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights.\n…\nTed's plan to lower and simplify taxes also favors manufacturers: they pay no tax on exports, encouraging more companies to come to Indiana and the rest of America's heartland, rather than transport jobs overseas.\nIndiana needs a partner as president who will reform the burgeoning regulatory state that has cost good-paying jobs while increasing the cost of living for hardworking Americans. President Obama's Clean Power Plan and Hillary Clinton's promised war on coal, with the support of Democrat gubernatorial candidate John Gregg, is projected to eliminate thousands of mining jobs in southwest Indiana, 20,000 manufacturing jobs across the entire state, and increase Hoosier's electric bills by 16%.\nTed has a plan to eliminate excessive government programs and has taken on big-government overreach. He led the fight to repeal Obamacare, one of the greatest burdens on families and small businesses and I have no doubt he will follow through in checking government power to restore prosperity to the people.\nThis is an exciting time for Hoosiers. The eyes of the nation are looking to Indiana to make a choice. I encourage every Hoosier to evaluate each of the candidates and exercise your right to vote in the May 3 Primary. My vote goes to Ted Cruz because he is a principled conservative who will work to protect our constitutional liberties, bring back better-paying jobs, and serve all Americans with the character and judgment needed to revive our national strength.", "timestamp": "2016-05-01", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Gov.

More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from more than 2.4 million donors totaling $210 million.\nA key to Sanders' fundraising success has been that his grassroots supporters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clinton's big-dollar donors. Sanders' April donations far exceeded Hillary for America's $21 million in March.\n\"What our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. \"Sanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement. He is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\"\nIn April, the average contribution was slightly less than $26. Only 3 percent of the total came from donors who have given the maximum $2,700 an individual may donate to a candidate. About 48 percent Hillary Clinton's primary campaign committee money comes from maxed-out donors.\nA typical Sanders donor is 27 years old. Forty-one percent of people giving to his campaign are between the ages of 18 and 39, an unprecedented level of support from younger Americans. 'Teacher' is the most common profession followed by 'student' and 'engineer.'\nSanders continued fundraising success comes as the presidential nomination contest with Clinton enters the final phase with 14 states, territories and the District of Columbia still to hold primaries or a caucuses. Sanders and Clinton are neck and neck in national polls with Sanders edging ahead in some surveys. He consistently is a much stronger general election candidate polling much better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Donald Trump or other Republican White House hopefuls.", "timestamp": "2016-05-01", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Raises $26M in April and Breaks $200M Raised for Campaign"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117341", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n12:52 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I hope you've all recovered from a busy weekend of source-building. (Laughter.) I know it was all business all the time over the weekend for everybody in this room. So hope you found time for a little fun, as well.\nI do not have any announcements to start. So, Kevin, we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. What is the White House's reaction to Puerto Rico's default of $370 million in bond payments? Did it have better options? And will this default create more urgency for lawmakers and the Obama administration to work something out?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I sure hope it creates a new sense of urgency for members of Congress to address this situation. It's a situation that we've been concerned about for quite some time. It's now been 194 days since the administration put forward our legislative proposal for addressing this situation. So I think that should be an indication to you and to the people of Puerto Rico that the administration has been focused on this for six months now. And unfortunately, we haven't seen the kind of movement in the Republican-led Congress that we need to see to make a bailout of Puerto Rico less likely.\nThe truth is, what the administration is seeking is to empower the Puerto Rican government with the kind of restructuring authority that cities all across the country have. And the administration believes that that restructuring authority should be contingent on the Puerto Rican government making some needed financial reforms. We also believe that there should be a mechanism for accountability and verifying that those reforms are being appropriately implemented.\nSo that's why it's wrong for people to describe this as a bailout. But the situation gets worse by the day. And some days, in some situations -- in some days, the situation gets notably worse. And it only makes a bailout more likely, which is why we continue to press hard for Republicans in Congress to stop dragging their feet and to address a situation that's having a negative impact on more than 3 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico.\nQ: Were there better options than today's default, such as maybe slashing government services? Is that the route Puerto Rico should have gone?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you'd be hard-pressed to make that case. But I'm certainly no financial expert. I'm not aware of all of the options that were available to the Puerto Rican government. And I don't think there's anybody here who can -- well, I'll just say, I don't think there are any good options for the Puerto Rican government at this point. And that's exactly why this restructuring authority is badly needed. You might even say that it's overdue. And it's also why a set of financial reforms is overdue, because there clearly are some significant problems that are plaguing the Puerto Rican government's budget but also having a negative impact on the broader economy.\nSo this situation requires an urgent response, and Republicans in Congress have been dragging their feet for too long.\nQ: Can you talk about where the President stands on this idea of creating safe zones within Syria? In the past, he's described them as impractical. And I would like to ask you, what has changed and what is the U.S. prepared to do to enforce these safe zones?\nMR. EARNEST: So, Kevin, I think there has been, in the lexicon here of describing the chaotic situation in Syria, there has been some, shall we say, confusion. The confusion does not stem from any government officials that I've seen, but it does apply to some observers of the situation. The President's view of safe zones has not changed. The President does not believe at this point that safe zones are a practical alternative to what currently is happening in Syria right now. There have been some who have advocated for the creation of no-fly zones or safe zones inside of Syria that would essentially provide a sanctuary for Syrian citizens.\nThe President is concerned about that kind of proposal because it puts the United States on the hook for essentially safeguarding the safe zones. That would require a significant commitment of ground troops. It would also put those ground troops on the front lines, because presumably you would have ISIL trying to encroach on those safe zones or trying to infiltrate them, and it could set up a very dangerous situation for American forces that doesn't actually make a lot of progress in terms of degrading and destroying ISIL.\nNow, the context in which safe zones has most recently been mentioned has been in the context of the cessation of hostilities. The cessation of hostilities was an agreement that the United States, Russia, and the rest of the international community, including the Assad regime, signed on to at the beginning of the year. And we warned -- we were aware at the beginning of the implementation of that cessation of hostilities that there were likely to be violations; that the implementation of that cessation of hostilities was likely to be bumpy. And the truth is, for most of the last couple of months, that cessation of hostilities has worked more effectively in reducing the violence in Syria than most people thought. And we were, frankly, surprised that the level of violence did reduce as much -- did come down as far as it did.\nThere have been violations all along. What's happened in the last couple of weeks is that we've seen an increase in the severity and frequency of violations of the cessation of hostilities. And what we have sought to do is to refresh that cessation of hostilities in those areas of the country where we've seen it start to fray.\nAnd the United States has been engaged in conversations with the Russians to try to get them to use their influence with the Assad regime to go back to living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities all across the country. This is a nationwide commitment that has been made. And in many places in the country it has yielded positive impacts on the ground. But there are some areas where it has started to fray. And that is where we are reinforcing our efforts to refresh the cessation of hostilities.\nQ: Are you saying this is a much narrower area of safe zones?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not call it safe zones. I would not call it safe zones. I know that there are some observers who are describing it as safe zones. I have not seen anybody in the U.S. government refer to them as safe zones. I certainly haven't referred to them as safe zones. And the reason is that it gets too complicated to try to differentiate between what we're talking about here. Let's be clear: The President is against safe zones. He's expressed that from the beginning because he doesn't want to put the United States in the situation of trying to enforce it.\nThe focus of our military should be on degrading and destroying ISIL. We should, however, collectively as an international community, be conscientious about living up to the commitments that were made by all the parties in the context of the cessation of hostilities. In those areas where we've seen the cessation start to fray in recent weeks, we need to reinforce our efforts to refresh the cessation of hostilities.\nAnd in particular, the Assad regime needs to live up to the commitments that they have made. And we would like to see the Russians use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to get them to do it.\nI guess this is the last thing I'll say about it. Russia did that once before. For several weeks we did have the effective implementation of a cessation of hostilities in which the Assad regime did curb their military activities. Just in the last couple of weeks we've seen the Assad regime go back to some of the nasty tactics. And we'd like to see the Russians go back to using their influence with the Assad regime to get them to live up to the cessation of hostilities in the way that they did before.\nRoberta.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the Greenpeace leaks of T-TIP. Today, Greenpeace published about half of the deal that's being negotiated, on a website. And we've already seen the response from USTR on this. But I'm wondering if you can tell us how damaging the White House feels that these leaks are for the prospects of reaching some kind of deal before the President leaves office.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the veracity of any of the documents that have been published. But I can tell you that we're not particularly concerned about these purported leaks.\nThe truth is the President has been very clear about what our strategy is when it comes to international trade. The President around the world has sought high-standard agreements. The reason for that is simple: That's consistent with our values. We believe that there should be high standards when it comes to human rights and labor rights and worker rights and environmental standards. And that's a good thing.\nSo we want the world to observe higher standards. But we also know that if the rest of the world observes those higher standards, that's going to level the playing field for American businesses and workers that already observe those standards. And that's going to create expanded economic opportunity for the American people. So that's the kind of trade strategy that the President has pursued in Asia, and it's the kind of strategy that has guided our participation in the T-TIP talks. But as it relates to the veracity of those documents, I just don't have any comment.\nQ: But are you concerned about the implications of these leaks on public opinion about T-TIP and how that might affect the eventual negotiations toward a deal by the end of the year?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not. And as the President described when he was in Europe just last week, our focus is on trying to complete these negotiations by the end of the year. I do not anticipate that we're going to be able to get Congress to act on it and have this agreement going into effect before the President leaves office. But there is the potential -- and we certainly are aiming -- to complete these talks by the end of the year. And I don't think there's anything about this leak that is going to have a material impact on our ability to do that.\nQ: And over the weekend there was what's being called an unprecedented breach of Baghdad's Green Zone -- hundreds of people storming over the glass walls around the zone, demanding political reforms. And this happened right after the Vice President's visit, obviously. So I'm wondering what your assessment is of what the visit accomplished and how concerned is the White House that this upheaval is really starting to -- or going to interfere with the fight against the Islamic State and plans for the coalition to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces as they begin to look at Mosul.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's almost two weeks ago now that the President did a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where he was asked quite directly by a journalist from The Washington Post about the political situation inside of Iraq. And the President noted at the time that he was concerned about the situation there.\nHe noted that the dynamics of the political debate inside of *Syria Iraq right now are a little bit different than they traditionally have been; that the political dialogue right now that has been so challenging is not one that breaks down along sectarian lines, but rather some disagreement within the Shia community in Iraq about the proper way to govern the country.\nSo this presents some unique challenges. And given the concerns about the situation inside of Iraq, Vice President Biden made his first trip to Iraq in more than four years. So I think the significance of a vice presidential visit underscores the significance of the challenges that are facing Iraq right now.\nObviously the Vice President's message was to reiterate our support for the reforms that are being pursued by the Abadi-led government. The Vice President also used his visit to underscore the U.S. and international community's commitment to economic support for Iraq. There are significant economic reforms that the government needs to implement. There's also some needed assistance that can be provided to Iraqi authorities that are seeking to rebuild communities that ISIL had previously controlled. And that is going to be a critical part of our effort to prevent ISIL from retaking those communities.\nAnd the President spent a lot of time talking about the need to support this Iraqi effort when he met with the GCC countries in Riyadh last week -- two weeks ago.\nAnd then the final thing that I think is important for people to understand is Vice President Biden was also there to talk about ongoing U.S. and international support for the military campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. Those military efforts in Iraq are led by Iraqi forces that are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. And we have been able to effectively work with Iraqi forces to drive ISIL out of about 40 percent of the populated territory that they previously held. That represents important progress. And we are looking for ways to keep that momentum going, including beginning to support Iraqi operations around Mosul to eventually prepare for the retaking of that city.\nSo there is obviously a lot of business that Vice President Biden was engaged in while he was in Iraq. And those conversations took place at a critical time for that country.\nLet's move around a little bit. Andrew.\nQ: A follow-up question on Iraq. The events of the weekend have obviously shown again how powerful Muqtada al-Sadr is. I was wondering if you could just remind us of what the U.S. position is with regard to him? Do U.S. officials meet with him? Do you consider him an interlocutor?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any high-level government meetings between U.S. officials and Muqtada al-Sadr. But I'd check with the State Department about that. I don't know if he's participated in any other broader meetings that may have included U.S. officials. So you should confirm that information with them.\nQ: But you would acknowledge that he is an important figure in Iraqi politics, even if he doesn't play a formal role?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly no expert in trying to divine what sort of influence individual figures in Iraq may have in the political situation there. I think as a matter of policy, the U.S. government certainly respects the sovereignty of the nation of Iraq and the responsibility that the Iraqi people have to determine political outcomes in their country. We're entirely respectful of that process.\nAnd, Andrew, in reading the news coverage over the weekend and in talking to some senior officials here at the White House who work on this issue all the time, I was reminded of the summer of 2014. You'll recall that when ISIL made its dramatic advance across the Iraqi desert and deeply encroached into Iraqi territory, there were significant questions raised about what the U.S. role would be in trying to get ISIL out of the country. In those early days the question was what the United States would do to protect Iraq from ISIL.\nAnd you'll recall at the time the President laid down a pretty clear marker that addressing the political failures of the Maliki government in Iraq was necessary before the United States could commit to the kind of military support that we're providing now. The reason for that is -- the assessment of our experts here is that Maliki's focus on governing along sectarian lines inside of Iraq significantly weakened the Iraqi government, but it also had a deleterious impact on the competence of Iraqi security forces. You essentially had some forces that were unwilling to defend some parts of the country based on the sectarian identification of the population.\nAnd President Obama made clear that a military commitment on the part of the United States would be contingent upon the establishment of an Iraqi central government that prioritized uniting the country across sectarian lines; that the ability of Kurds and Sunnis and Shia in Iraq to work together to defeat ISIL was going to be critical to their success. And Prime Minister Abadi has demonstrated a commitment to prioritizing a government philosophy that unites the country.\nAnd that's why the United States has been supportive of his efforts to implement reforms, but ultimately those reforms need to be responsive to the concerns and priorities of the Iraqi people. That's his top priority. He's the leader of a sovereign nation. And that's why the United States can be supportive of his efforts, but ultimately it's Prime Minister Abadi listening to the Iraqi people that will make decisions about how to effectively run that country.\nQ: Do you think Abadi is backsliding slightly on his promises to make a non-sectarian government?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think he has demonstrated during his time –- speaking broadly, he has demonstrated during his time in office that he's committed to a multi-sectarian Iraq, and he has governed consistent with that vision. For him, it's a legitimate national security priority and I think he understands the stakes. I also think he's not just doing that because it's his own personal preference and because it's critical to the national security of the country; I think he's doing that because he thinks it's a reflection of the ambitions of the Iraqi people and that the success of his country will depend upon his success in unifying that country to counter the challenges that they currently face.\nBecause, look, we also have to remember it's not just ISIL that poses a threat to Iraq. Iraq is going through some pretty challenging, wrenching changes to their economy. The significantly lower price of oil has proved to be a significant challenge to that country. There are also challenges related to their infrastructure, like repairing the Mosul Dam, that are time-consuming both in terms of the amount of money that's required to deal with that situation but it also requires a level of expertise that is not easily found.\nSo there are some significant challenges, and Prime Minister Abadi is dealing with a lot right now. And the rest of the international community is going to be supportive of him as he tries to make the changes consistent with his responsibilities as the Prime Minister of Iraq.\nJustin.\nQ: First, I just wanted to follow on the second part of Roberta's question, which is the impact of the instability. Over the weekend, on plans to retake Mosul, obviously those efforts are going to take buy-in from all the different parts of competing interests within Iraq. And there had been a sense, I think after the trip, that the political situation had calmed, planning to kind of finalize how they were going to go into Mosul could continue and be completed to prevent inaction. So I'm wondering, now that there seems to be backsliding there, if the President's sort of perceived deadline at the end of the year is in danger or could be pushed back farther.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, based on the briefings that I've received this morning, our national security professionals have not detected any impact on our ongoing counter-ISIL activities in Iraq, based on the political instability in Baghdad over the weekend. The United States and our coalition partners conducted 59 airstrikes and six artillery strikes against ISIL targets in northern Iraq and Anbar Province. That was just over the weekend. And the ongoing effort to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi forces has continued unabated.\nSo what we have said all along is that specific military decisions like when to begin the operation against Mosul will be made by Iraqi forces and the Iraqi central government. Again, we continue to respect the sovereignty of this independent nation, and we continue to partner with them and work effectively with them, both to carry out ongoing operations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, but also to plan for future military operations.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the President's trip to Flint later this week. Governor Snyder has been under a lot of pressure, and eventually he kind of did a photo-op to drink the tap water in Flint as a sign of solidarity. So I'm wondering if the President is going to drink the filtered Flint water while he is there and if he also plans to meet with Governor Snyder.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any photo-ops that involve the President's consumption of water. Based on what the EPA has communicated to the public, is that properly filtered water in Flint is safe to drink. So I certainly would encourage people to continue to listen to the advice that they get from our scientific and public health experts about what water is safe to drink, and the President will certainly follow that advice.\nQ: And then the last thing is, news came of Malia's college plans over the weekend, and I'm wondering if you might be able to shed any insight on what she's doing with her gap year.\nMR. EARNEST: I cannot.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to follow up kind of on Justin. And I have another question. It's kind of an urban week for the President. He's traveling to Flint and then he's also doing the Howard University commencement. Are there any threads that are going to travel through to both of his speeches, in Flint and in Howard? And will he be making any news when it comes to the urban front?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, stay tuned. I'm not in a position to begin previewing the President's commencement address at Howard at this point, but the President and his team have been working on his speech for a couple of weeks now. But check in later this week, and maybe I'll be able to give you a better sense of what the President's plans are for that speech.\nQ: All right. And I also want to ask you -- this weekend at his last White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, he gave jokes, got some ribbing. What did he think about the final words that were delivered to him and of him, the President of the United States -- a word that is one of the worst words many people say you could say to anyone, that's gone down in history? What did he think about that? What's his reaction?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I think the first thing that I would observe is that any comedian who signed up to follow President Obama at the White House Correspondents' Dinner is assuming one of the most difficult tasks in comedy. Just by nature of the engagement, that's a tough job, following the President of the United States.\nPresident Obama also, over the years, has shown himself to be rather adept at delivering a speech that consists primarily of one- or two-liners, and the President enjoys that opportunity.\nSo the point is that Mr. Wilmore had a difficult job that he was facing on Saturday, and the President's expectation is he took -- as Mr. Wilmore took on that responsibility, is that comedians are going to go right up to the line.\nQ: Did he cross the line? Many African Americans in that room, to include civil rights leaders, black comedians, were very appalled. Even members of the Republican Party -- black Republicans were upset, black Democrats were upset. People felt that not just throwing it at him, but throwing it at them, and also it diminished the office of the presidency and it diminished him. Did he cross the line?\nMR. EARNEST: April, what I would say is that it's not the first time that people, on the Monday after the White House Correspondent's Dinner, that some people have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line. That happened in 2006, after Stephen Colbert delivered his speech. There were many people who felt like he had overstepped his bounds in delivering his remarks. To a lesser extent, many people made the same observation about the presentation of Wanda Sykes in 2009. So it's not the first time that we've had a conversation like this in which these kinds of concerns have been raised or expressed.\nLook, I had an opportunity to speak to the President about this briefly this morning, and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments that Mr. Wilmore expressed. He ended his speech by saying that he couldn't put into words the pride that he felt in the President. And he made the observation that our country has make remarkable progress just in his lifetime -- from not being willing to accept an African American quarterback, to electing and reelecting an African American not just to lead the United States, but to lead the free world. Again, I take Mr. Wilmore at his words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifetime, and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.\nQ: Did Mr. Wilmore's use of freedom of speech give the President's detractors fodder now to be able to be able to call him that and call others that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have no idea what impact Larry Wilmore's speech is going to have on the President's critics, and I don't think I'm going to spend much time worrying about it.\nQ: I understand that there is a conversation about that word. The President, in June of last year, used it as a teaching moment to show that issues of race are still a problem in this country. But Wilmore used it for the President somewhat as a butt of the joke. And you were in that room, as well as I was. There was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness. And people didn't know how to handle that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I know this is a word that does -- let me say it this way: I'm confident that Mr. Wilmore used the word by design. He was seeking to be provocative. But I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the President as the butt of a joke. So what is true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job. And the President's expectation when he walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.\nQ: I just want to be very clear: So the President is okay with his use and how he used the N-word, \"jiggaboo,\" \"Negro Night,\" and thug\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I'll just restate what I said before, which is that the President expressed -- well, what the President said is that he appreciated the spirit of Mr. Wilmore's expressions on Saturday night.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up on one of Justin's questions about the Flint trip. Governor Snyder told reporters this morning he's looking to meet with the President. So is that meeting going to happen on Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess his schedule got a little freed up, huh?\nQ: I guess so.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess so. We're still putting together the President's visit. It's traditional for the President, when he travels to a state, to invite the governor to at least greet him on the tarmac. That invitation was extended to Governor Snyder in the context of this visit. And we're obviously pleased that it looks like he'll now be in Flint on that day. So we'll keep you posted on what sort of interactions they may have.\nQ: And on the Supreme Court fight, the President is doing a series of local interviews this afternoon.\nMR. EARNEST: He is.\nQ: And I know some of the groups that are allied with the White House are doing some protests and other things like that in some of the states where Republican senators reside, over the recess. But what I'm wondering from you is, what are you looking for out of these actions over this week? I know your ultimate goal is hearings and a vote. But what needs to happen over this week for you to define your efforts as a success?\nMR. EARNEST: Jordan, we're going to continue to apply pressure to Republicans to do their job. It's a pretty simple message that we're delivering. Since 1875, every Supreme Court nominee, who hasn't later been retracted by the President of the United States, has received a hearing and/or a vote by the United States Senate. That's why what Republicans are vowing to do is unprecedented and a dramatic escalation of partisan politics. That's problematic because, even in this era of divided government and polarized politics, there's been an effort by both sides to try to insulate the U.S. justice system and the institution of the United States Supreme Court from that political stray voltage. But Republicans have, in this case, ramped it up. Look, even Senator Graham, who served four years on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has acknowledged that what Republicans are vowing to do and are doing is unprecedented.\nSeveral Republicans -- or at least a couple of them come to mind -- have indicated that they're treating President Obama's nominee differently than they would treat a nominee that's put forward by a Republican President. They're acknowledging that this is not driven by some peculiar reading of the Constitution, but it's driven by a raw, partisan political calculation that Republicans in the Senate have made to obstruct this nominee not because of any concerns about the nominee's judicial philosophy; they're obstructing this nominee simply because Chief Judge Garland was put forward by Barack Obama. That's unfortunate particularly when you consider that Chief Judge Garland is somebody who has more experience on the federal judiciary than any Supreme Court nominee in American history. He served on the second-highest court in the land for 19 years. In taking a close look at that record, it's evident that he understands that the job of a federal judge is to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.\nSo that's the argument that we'll make. I recognize -- I would acknowledge that this is an argument that we've spent a lot of the last two months making. But this is an opportunity for the President to sit before local television anchors and make the argument once again, and present it, hopefully, in a compelling way that will have an impact on the constituents of five or six Republican senators.\nQ: Right. But we haven't seen any real movement on the question of hearings or -- hearings or a vote from these five senators, despite you making these arguments over and over again. So if we don't hear movement over this next week when you're applying that pressure, is that going to be concerning to you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we started out with Republicans across the board -- at least the Senate Republican Leader saying that Republicans wouldn't meet with the President's nominee. But as you know, Chief Judge Garland has now met with 14 different Republican senators, and there are more plans for when Congress returns from their weeklong recess next week.\nSo we have made some progress in that regard, and we're going to continue to just apply pressure to Republicans until I make the case that they should do their job. Look, I've said this before too: The American people expect that if you're going to show up every two weeks and collect a paycheck, that you should do your job. And right now, Senate Republicans aren't doing it despite the fact they are picking up a six-figure paycheck.\nMike.\nQ: Two topics. First, back to the safe zones question. So I just want to clarify -- what you guys call them are \"safe areas,\" not \"safe zones,\" correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think there's a term of art, Mike. What we're trying to do --\nQ: Well, the President called it safe areas when he was asked about this during the press conference with President [sic] Merkel in Germany, and he said there's no space between him and Chancellor Merkel on the question of whether or not there are areas to carve out in Syria that he would support the idea of carving out what he called \"safe areas\" through the political process. So I just want to make sure that what you're suggesting seems to be different than what the President said during that news conference. He says he supports the idea of carving out some safe areas in Syria through the political process. You're saying he doesn't support any such thing?\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, what we're trying to do is we're trying to put back in place a cessation of hostilities across the country. The cessation of hostilities applies everywhere in Syria.\nQ: So the President said, \"If we can get the political transition to separate out areas where a moderate oppositions that's at the table controls it, that should be a safe area. If it's ISIL or Nusra, that's not a safe area. And that's the concept we've been trying to build.\"\nSo that suggests that there are -- I mean, short of a complete cessation of hostilities -- which I suppose you would support, first and foremost -- but short of that, it does seem like the President supports the idea of creating some space inside Syria that is safe, whether you call it a zone or an area.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what our goal, Mike, is to reinforce the effective implementation of a cessation of hostilities nationwide in Syria. And there are particular areas where there have been repeated and increasing violations of the cessation of hostilities. And our goal is to reinforce our effort to refresh the cessation of hostilities in those areas where we've seen violations. But that is not a reference to any sort of new tactic to try to address the political situation in Syria. Our goal all along has been to implement a cessation of hostilities all across the country to try to add some momentum to the ongoing political talks.\nThe other thing that I have said before, but not from the context of these conversations that's a relevant fact, is neither Nusra or other extremist groups like ISIL have signed on to the cessation of hostilities. So we would like to see a cessation of hostilities all across the country, but that is not going to have an impact on the ability of the United States or our coalition partners to go after ISIL.\nQ: And then on a second topic, back to Flint. The President and the White House has been highly critical I think of the state environmental apparatus in Michigan for their failures, as have a lot of people. As the President goes back, what is the President prepared to say or apologize for in terms of the federal government and the EPA's failures to act more quickly in the face of the water problems in Flint? I mean, there have been some lower-level resignations from EPA -- and I know that some of the federal officials have been there since and are I guess going back ahead of the President's visit -- but is the President prepared to say to the people of Flint that we screwed up too, at the federal level?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is prepared to acknowledge that, as President of the United States, he takes responsibility for lots of things. But what's also true is that the blue-ribbon independent commission that was appointed by the Republican governor of the state of Michigan found, \"primary responsibility for the water contamination in Flint lies with the MDEQ,\" which is the state-run environmental agency in Michigan.\nWhat's also true is that the Attorney General has filed criminal charges against some state employees for their role in this as well. So I don't, however, expect for the President to spend a lot of time talking about specific accountability, primarily because there continues to be ongoing investigations into that accountability, and the President doesn't want to be perceived as weighing in on one side or the other.\nBut the President will certainly go to Michigan and make a forceful case that as the President of the United States, he feels responsible for the safety and wellbeing of every American, no matter which community they live in. And I think that would certainly explain the widespread federal effort in Flint to help the people of Flint deal with this emergency situation. 7.3 million liters of water have been distributed by federal employees. We've seen 55,000 water and pitcher filters be distributed in communities there. About a quarter of a million replacement cartridges have been passed out as well. There's been a significant expansion of health care access, paid for by the federal government. This access comes both in the forms of expanding Medicaid eligibility, but also in terms of offering grants to local health care providers so that they have more resources to treat more people.\nSo this is all a reflection of the federal government's commitment to helping the people of Flint deal with what's a tragic situation.\nQ: But one last thing. I mean, that's sort of post-crisis, right? That's the response to the crisis once it had been fully realized.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: I guess the question is, is the President prepared to –- he's going to be meeting with a group of people, I guess, around the table. If they look at him and say, yes, obviously there were failures at the state level but where was the federal government a year ago, a year and a half ago, two years ago when this was all happening -- what does he say to them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think he says that the EPA takes very seriously the responsibility that they have to work effectively with state regulators to ensure the clean air and clean water of everybody in America. And that's why more than six weeks ago, the administrator of the EPA sent a letter to governors all across the country, making clear exactly what responsibilities state regulators have when it comes to enforcing the lead and copper rule. She was also clear in that letter that there will be a response from the EPA if the state regulators fall down on the job.\nSo that level of clarity hopefully will prevent the situation in Flint from reemerging in other communities. And that obviously is a top priority of the President's as well.\nJosh.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back to the Supreme Court. I just want to ask you the question: Have you given any consideration to the thought process of Senate Republicans that you mentioned are taking some heat from their constituents on Merrick Garland and their decision to completely dismiss the nominating process rather than go ahead and at least go through the motions of the process, even if the outcome is predetermined?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think it's pretty clear what's happening here. The reason that the leader of Republicans in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, issued a statement just hours after the announcement of Justice Scalia's death is that he wanted to try to shut down the process as soon as possible. He recognized that if the President put forward a highly qualified, experienced, respectable individual with impeccable legal credentials to fill that vacancy, that there would be enormous pressure on Republicans to vote and confirm this individual.\nAnd that's exactly what Republicans are trying not to do. The President effectively called their bluff by nominating someone that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. Even Republicans who have met with Chief Judge Garland have had very positive things to say about his character and about his aptitude for the job. So people like Pat Toomey said that he was \"very, very smart and very knowledgeable.\" Republican Senator Rob Portman from Ohio described Chief Judge Garland as \"an impressive guy.\" Senator Flake from Arizona described Chief Judge Garland as \"obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.\" Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina described him as \"honest and capable\" and described his reputation as \"beyond reproach.\"\nSo what Republicans are trying to do is they're trying to prevent a situation in which Chief Judge Garland sits before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answers any questions that come his way. We know that if there's a hearing like this, it's going to be –- it's going to get lots of attention. It will be carried live on many of the networks that are represented in this room, at least for parts of the hearing. And the expectation the President has is that Chief Judge Garland is going to use his brilliant legal mind and 19 years of judicial experience to effectively answer those questions.\nAnd once that hearing is completed, you'll really see pressure on Republicans to explain their position, trying to block his confirmation to the Supreme Court. So what we have seen from Republicans, particularly Republican leaders in Washington, is to shut down this effort before it can build momentum. But I think in spite of their efforts, we have built up some momentum and some pressure on Republicans.\nAnd I do think this is why every Republican senator across the country, including Senator Ayotte, is facing a central question: Are they going to listen to Republican leaders in the United States Senate and not do their job? Or are they going to do what the United States Constitution requires? And that is to offer their advice and consent for the President's choice to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\nFollowing the instructions of Republican leaders in Washington I don't think is going to be a particularly persuasive explanation for their conduct when Republican senators are facing their constituents.\nMark.\nQ: I'm sorry, on Syria, I still don't understand. If safe zones or safe areas is not the purpose in Geneva, then why are negotiators there looking at maps and drawing up lines of areas where allegedly civilians and/or members of the moderate opposition could shelter? They're looking at maps. That's what our people are telling us.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, Mark, the goal of the conversations in Geneva are to build confidence in a political transition. And what the negotiators in Geneva on the opposition side of the table have indicated is it's very difficult for them to engage in political talks when their constituents back home are being bombed recklessly and tragically by the regime.\nAnd so the idea behind the cessation of hostilities was to try to bring the violence between the opposition and the government to an end so that negotiations could take place. So what the negotiators are doing is trying to find a way to get the regime to stop bombing their people so that they can try to come to some sort of political agreement. What we found is that at least for a while, when the cessation of hostilities was initially implemented, that that actually worked out a little bit better than anybody expected.\nAnd part of that was because the Russian government, President Putin, was willing to put his own credibility on the line and was willing to make a strong case to the Assad regime that they needed to abide by the cessation of hostilities. And we want them to just go back and do the same thing.\nQ: No, I get that. But what I don't understand is, if they're sitting down and drawing lines on a map and saying this area is going to be off limits, is that not a safe zone or a safe area, or propose some other way to call it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the reason that I don't think I would describe it that way is that ISIL and Nusra are not part of the cessation of hostilities. It's the Assad regime that has signed onto the cessation of hostilities. So I think when there was a broader discussion about safe zones and the President was asked directly in a news conference about whether or not he would support the concept of a safe zone, and the President expressed his strong opposition to it, is that he didn't want to create a situation in which the United States was on the hook for protecting that safe zone from incursions by extremists, by Nusra, by ISIL, or by the regime. So the conversations that are taking place in Geneva right now are focused very specifically on where we can reinforce our efforts to implement successfully a cessation of hostilities, to try to lower the violence, to advance political talks, but also allow the shipment of humanitarian relief into areas that have long been caught in the crossfire.\nMegan.\nQ: Josh, thanks. There's two topics I wanted to ask about. First, the 28 pages of classified documents in the 9/11 Commission report. CIA Director John Brennan over the weekend saying that there could be some inaccuracies in there and some unvetted information. Is the President concerned about that? And how close is the White House to releasing those documents?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I saw that there was a little attention that was generated by Director Brennan's comments. I have to admit I was surprised by that attention because there was an op-ed that was written just last week by Lee Hamilton and Governor Kean from New Jersey. Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean were the chair of the independent commission that took a look at the 9/11 attacks, both the events that led to the attacks but also proposed reforms that would prevent those kinds of attacks from occurring on American soil ever again.\nThey wrote that op-ed and indicated that they also saw the 28 pages. They described those 28 pages as unvetted, law enforcement investigative materials. And they said they had an opportunity to review that material, to follow up on leads, and that they actually conducted interviews not just in the United States but around the world to follow up on that information. And as we've discussed many times in this room over the last several weeks, the conclusion of their report is that they found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution had supported al Qaeda.\nSo Director Brennan's comments are entirely in line with those that were put forward by Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, who had a responsibility to look at that material, to follow up on the claims, and to offer up an unclassified conclusion about what was included there.\nQ: So how close is the White House to releasing the documents? And is there concern that releasing them is going to be a mistake?\nMR. EARNEST: The White House is not responsible for releasing the documents. Those documents are currently in the possession of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. That is the office that is responsible for processing sensitive information that is being considered for public release. They have a declassification process that they conduct that is part of their standard operating procedure. I would acknowledge that they have been conducting that process on this material for quite some time. And the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has indicated that they are hopeful they can complete that process by the end of June.\nQ: And second, on Donald Trump and some comments that he made over the weekend. He seemed to indicate that campaigning is more difficult than governing, saying, \"It's harder to become President, in my opinion, than to do a great job at being President.\" Would the President agree with that assessment? Or do you have a comment?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any comment on that.\nJulianna, nice to see you. I'm used to you sitting one chair behind you.\nQ: I know, me too.\nMR. EARNEST: So welcome back to the briefing.\nQ: It's good to be in the front row. Thank you. Just going back to Saturday night, can you talk a little bit about how the cameo with former Speaker John Boehner came about in the President's speech?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure. Well, it's pretty simple and in some ways depicted in the video, which is that the White House called Speaker Boehner and asked him if he'd be interested in participating in the video. And I think as was evident from the finished product, he was an enthusiastic participant in the production.\nLook, Speaker Boehner has a well-known and very good sense of humor. And he made I think a very positive contribution to our comedic efforts in the film.\nQ: When was it filmed? And did they meet in addition to the taping to talk about current events, politics, Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: They had an opportunity to spend time together in the context of filming the video. There was no separate meeting. But the video was actually just filmed on Friday, so just a few days ago.\nQ: And did they talk about the Speaker's comments about Ted Cruz from the night before?\nMR. EARNEST: There was not a detailed discussion of those comments, no.\nQ: And then, also, over the weekend, Bernie Sanders said that there was going to be a contested convention, and essentially called on Democratic super-delegates to flip to support him. Is that something the President thinks is appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the President thinks is appropriate is individual candidates should make their own decisions about running their campaign. And we've obviously seen a very rigorous campaign on the Democratic side, and there's still some contests to go and more opportunities for Democratic voters across the country to weigh in on who they believe should represent our party in the general election. And the President thus far has refrained from weighing on that debate too much.\nRon.\nQ: On Flint and the governor, you mentioned that the White House has extended an invitation for him to meet the President at the airport. Its sounds like the governor wants a lot more in terms of a substantive meeting with the President, and has requested that. Has there been a response to that request?\nMR. EARNEST: We haven't determined the President's schedule for his trip to Flint. As a matter of standard operating procedure, we invited the governor to come to the airport. So the invitation to Governor Snyder's office was not unique; it's one that's even been extended to him a few times before.\nQ: I guess the question is, does the President see the governor as someone that he thinks is important to meet and spend some time with there as a solution found to the problem?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly intends to spend quite a bit of time when he's in Flint talking to local residents, talking to local officials. I don't know at this point exactly the extent of the conversations that the President will have with Governor Snyder, but we'll let you know.\nQ: And given what you were saying about how the state has been sort of blamed for all this, I was wondering how could he see the Governor as having the capacity and the credibility to be a viable partner in this whole process going forward.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Governor Snyder, to his credit, has recognized that there is an important role for the state to play in helping the citizens of Flint recover.\nAnd obviously the U.S. government, the federal government, at the direction of President Obama, has been deeply involved in that recovery effort. But state officials have been, too. I'll leave it to the state officials to detail what contributions they have made to that.\nBut look, this is a situation that should transcend politics. This should be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together and try to right many of the wrongs that have been sustained by the citizens of Flint.\nQ: And does the President have any specific priorities in terms of what he wants to see happen as a result of this visit? I know that there's the idea of generally reassuring residents, and you delineated the list of the water. So is there some aspect of this crisis that the President thinks should be changed, focused on, alleviated as a result of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I would not anticipate that the President will make big news by announcing a new package of relief for the city of Flint. Obviously, there's been a significant commitment of resources to try to help the people of Flint in this urgent situation. You've heard me here advocate on a couple of occasions that Congress should get involved here. Congress should mobilize some resources that could be used to address the situation in Flint.\nI think what's also true is the President will make a broader argument about just how important it is for government at all levels to function effectively. That stands in pretty stark contrast to some Republican candidates who suggest that environmental agencies shouldn't even exist.\nQ: On the Iraq situation, just quickly. The Green Zone barriers were breached. And the reporting suggested that a lot of the security forces there basically let the protesters in. So is the United States confident that won't happen again? And are you concerned about the level of security in that area? And I know the reporting was that the embassy was never threatened, and there were false rumors about evacuations, but that aspect of the situation, you had this fortress for 12 or 13 years, and now it does not seem to be a fortress anymore. How concerned about you about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, the President of the United States is concerned every day about the safety and security of Americans serving our country overseas. And that includes our diplomats. That is always a top priority and at the top of the list when it comes to making decisions about U.S. policy in countries around the world.\nFor example, in the immediate aftermath of the ISIL advance across Iraq in 2014, the President's primary concern was about the safety of American diplomats and American personnel in Erbil and in Baghdad. And the initial military response that President Obama mobilized was to safeguard those American citizens. So this is always a top priority.\nI can tell you that the U.S. has received assurances from Iraqi officials that they understand their obligations to protect diplomatic facilities. And we certainly take them at their word. But look, we're going to continue to closely monitor the situation because the safety and security of our personnel is always the President's top priority.\nQ: Is it true that the security guards essentially let the protesters in, didn't stop them? That's got to be worrying.\nMR. EARNEST: It's a pretty chaotic situation there. I'm not sure that anybody knows exactly what happened on the ground. But look, we're always interested in understanding how developments on the ground could have an impact on the safety and security of American citizens who are serving over in Iraq. That is the President's top priority. We're going to continue to monitor the situation closely as a result. And we have received assurances from the Iraqi government and from Iraqi security forces that they're prepared to live up to their international obligations to protect diplomats that are serving in Baghdad.\nQ: Has there been some contemplation of increasing the security posture at the U.S. embassy or inside the Green Zone as a result of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Decisions that are made specifically about enhancing the security around any particular diplomatic facility would be made over at the State Department. But obviously we're continuing to closely watch the situation. And if the security experts determine that additional security is needed, we'll make sure they have the resources necessary to make those changes.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to take you back to the 28 pages. And based on your earlier comments, you're generally aware of what Director Brennan said, using words like, inaccurate, uncorroborated, and unvetted -- echoing the column that we saw in USA Today. Does the President concur with that assessment, that analysis of what's in those 28 pages?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President has not read the 28 pages. He's been briefed on their contents. And look, I think you can reliably assume that based on the comments both of Director Brennan and Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, who don't serve in the Obama administration, that what both of them have described is an accurate understanding of the contents of those 28 pages.\nQ: Okay. And then based on that, does the President feel like the DNI needs to move forward with its review? It's been more than 14 years -- and you have I have talked about this -- it just doesn't seem like there's any reason not to release it, based on the fact that you said a number of people have looked at this and there doesn't seem to be anything that would affect national security. Maybe a little embarrassing perhaps on some circumstances. But again, it's preliminary information. It's not hard-and-fast stuff. They're saying that this is partial information. And why not just release it so the American people --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm going to defer to the experts who have a day-to-day responsibility for determining what sensitive national security information can be released to the public without having a negative impact on our interests or our ability to protect the American people. And that is what should drive the decision. And the good news is that our intelligence officials have indicated that they expect to complete that process by the end of June. And we'll look forward to their decision at that point.\nQ: And just one last nugget on that one. Is there any reason why the President would not have read those pages? You've said previously he was generally aware, and then you said he's been briefed on them. Why not read them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President obviously reads a lot of material on a day-to-day basis. Again, I'm not sure that he felt it was necessary for him to read those 28 pages.\nQ: He's not opposed to reading it --\nMR. EARNEST: Correct.\nQ: -- just hasn't gotten around to it.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: Okay. Last, I want to ask you about the cruise from Miami to Cuba. An historic day not just in South Florida but obviously over on the island. Any thoughts or comments on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the latest reports on this. Obviously the goal of the President's policy changes towards Cuba was motivated by a desire to begin to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba, because the President's assumption is that for 50 years we tried to isolate the Cuban government in the hopes that that would apply pressure to them to do a better job of respecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people. That didn't work for five decade. That policy of isolation was carried out with little tangible impact.\nSo the President decided that we needed to try a different strategy, and that that this strategy would be focused on engagement -- engagement between the Cuban people and American citizens; engagement between the Cuban government and the U.S. government; engagement between Cuban businesses and American businesses -- and that by establishing those deeper ties, we would be able to better advance our interests and our values.\nAnd look, this is a policy change that's only been in place for a little over a year at this point. But look, I think we're optimistic about the progress that we have made thus far. There certainly is a lot more work to be done, and there's certainly a number of additional reforms we'd like to see the Cuban government undertake. But I think it would be hard to deny that this policy change hasn't benefitted the American people. And look, I think the best proof point for that is to go and ask my counterparts at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau, and other traditionally Republican-supporting institutions that have been strongly supportive of this President's change of policy towards Cuba.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Will we be getting the drone civilian casualty report before the anniversary of the NDU speech?\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, I don't have an update for you on the timing of that report. Obviously, the President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, delivered a speech six weeks or so ago now, indicating that we were prepared to begin releasing additional material about the results of counterterrorism operations. I don't have an update for you in terms of timing, though.\nQ: And does the President believe that Japan deserves a formal U.S. government apology for the bombing of Hiroshima?\nMR. EARNEST: No, he does not.\nQ: And last one. Just to button up April's line of questioning -- because we're being asked -- how much visibility did the White House have into what Mr. Wilmore was going to say on Saturday night?\nMR. EARNEST: None.\nMichelle.\nQ: So wait, just to further clarify that clarification -- (laughter) --\nMR. EARNEST: Could I possibly be clearer than none? I'll try. (Laughter.)\nQ: Sorry, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: That's okay. Occupational hazard.\nQ: So Wilmore's team didn't run by the possibility that he would throw in the N-word at the end of his spiel?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The White House staff did not vet the President's remarks with Mr. Wilmore. And Mr. Wilmore did not vet his remarks with the White House staff.\nQ: Okay. And based on what you were saying before, are you saying that the President was not bothered at all by the use of that word?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm saying that the President appreciated the sentiment that Mr. Wilmore expressed in his speech. And I think any fair reading of the last three paragraphs of that speech I think make clear that the personal views that Mr. Wilmore was expressing came from a genuine place. And he expressed his -- he said at the end --\nQ: Was that a copy they gave you before to vet? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: No. At the risk of free publicity, this is the blogpost from Jonathan Capehart at The Washington Post. But in here he included the end of Mr. Wilmore's remarks, and he said -- this is Mr. Wilmore here -- he said, \"A black man was thought by his mere color not good enough to lead a football team. And now to live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the free world, words alone do me no justice.\" That is an authentic expression of his personal viewpoint, and it's an authentic expression of his appreciation for the President of the United States, but also for the capacity of this country to change. And the President has observed that progress on a number of occasions, and Mr. Wilmore was doing the same.\nQ: And I didn't really expect to be on this subject so soon, but while we're on it -- some of the jokes that the President made about Hillary Clinton kind of got a mixed reaction. Some people think that they were harsher than expected. Did he have a conversation with Clinton, either before or after the dinner, on the subject?\nMR. EARNEST: He did not. But it appears that that conversation was not necessary, because I did see the Tweet from Secretary Clinton indicating her approval for those comments.\nQ: Right. But he didn't reach out to her, either before or after, to --\nMR. EARNEST: No, he did not.\nQ: Actually, one of President Obama's more cutting jokes was at CNN. So was he saying that --\nMR. EARNEST: Don't tell me you guys got all sensitive. (Laughter.) It's all in good fun.\nQ: Okay, so he doesn't think that CNN has a problem journalistically?\nMR. EARNEST: He doesn't.\nQ: Does he think that Hillary Clinton is the presumptive next President of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President obviously had an apt joke about turning over the podium at the White House Correspondents' Dinner to the next President, no matter who she is. Again, look the President was making a joke and acknowledging that there are a number of votes that remain to be cast before the American people have decided who will assume the awesome responsibility of addressing the White House Correspondents' Dinner next year.\nQ: Okay. And on the subject -- back to the 28 pages.\nMR. EARNEST: Mr. Nakamura did not like my joke. (Laughter.) So there's a reason that I will not be assuming the podium at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.\nQ: I mean, we've been through this, and the President had an opportunity to just recently sit down with the Saudis on this. But given the reaction that could come after the release of those pages, is there any expectation that this will affect the relationship with the Saudis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's difficult to anticipate exactly what the reaction will be if that decision is made. So I sort of hesitate to hazard a guess that's rooted in a hypothetical here. But the one thing I think I would point out is simply that the President did have an opportunity to meet with King Salman for about two hours in Riyadh shortly after we arrived in Saudi Arabia a week ago last Wednesday.\nThey met for two hours, and this question about the 28 pages did not come up in their meeting. I assure you they covered a wide variety of topics, but this was not one of them. So I think that would be at least one indication that this is not an issue that rates at the same level of some of the other challenges that are plaguing the Middle East right now.\nQ: Okay, it's been months now since the President put forward Garland as the nominee. And given that public pressure is something that you're going for -- either to change minds now, or change voters' minds later -- but given that at this point, with the public pressure that you've tried to apply, that outside groups have tried to apply, do you feel like the public outrage isn't necessarily there when you see that very few Republican senators' minds have changed at this point? And does that tell you that possibly the public outrage won't be there to change anything at the polls, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, we're not seeking to provoke public outrage. We want to have a discussion about whether or not Republicans in the Senate are prepared to do their job.\nThere are plenty of candidates out there that may be trying to stoke that outrage to achieve a political aim of one form or another. I think the President would observe that's precisely the problem. Let's focus a little less on provoking public outrage and a little more on doing your job. And that's what Republicans, and particularly Republicans in the Senate have refused to do.\nQ: Yes, but some of the words and phrases you've used to describe what Republicans are doing are pretty harsh. And the fact that no -- if you're going for public pressure, the fact that no Republican minds have changed at this point, does that tell you that it's not working?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a lot of Republican minds across the country have concluded that Republican senators who are refusing to do their job just because Mitch McConnell asked them to I think is an indication that we are making some progress. There are at least two Republican senators that have come out in support of Chief Judge Garland getting a hearing and a vote. There's at least one high-profile Senate candidate in the state of Florida that has come out and indicated that Chief Judge Garland deserves a vote. There are some former Republican senators -- people like Dick Lugar and Tom Coburn -- who have come out and indicated that they believe that Chief Judge Garland deserves a hearing and a vote.\nI don't know if those people changed their minds, or if this is the view that they had all along. But there is plenty of evidence to indicate that there are plenty of Republicans who agree with the case that President Obama has made, which is that Republicans should not for the first time since 1875 deny a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. That would be an unprecedented escalation of partisan politics into a Supreme Court process that has historically been shielded from a lot of partisan stray voltage.\nLook, there have been politics that have polluted this process in the past. The President has acknowledged that there's no one party that is responsible for that. But there's also no denying that it is Republicans in this instance that they're escalating this partisanship in a way that's not good for the country. And it certainly is not fair to a distinguished public servant like Chief Judge Garland who has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.\nQ: Does the administration still think that this is going to go to a vote -- to hearings and a vote, ultimately?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I have refrained from predicting legislative outcomes.\nQ: No -- Denis McDonough, maybe a month and a half ago, said that he believed that this would go there, and then you agreed, and you felt that that's -- do you still feel that way?\nMR. EARNEST: I still feel that that's exactly what should happen. And we wouldn't be making this case, and the President wouldn't be devoting about an hour of his afternoon to talking to local television anchors if we didn't think this is something that can and should be done.\nDavid.\nQ: Josh, a couple more on Hiroshima. We're about less than three weeks before the President leaves for Asia. I'm wondering if you can provide an update as to whether the President will visit Hiroshima.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you in terms of the President's schedule when he's in Japan at this point. But we're obviously hard at work planning that trip.\nQ: Can you rule it out? We're less than three weeks from the trip.\nMR. EARNEST: I cannot --\nQ: -- added a potential stop --\nMR. EARNEST: I can't rule it out at this point. The President's itinerary for this trip to Japan is not yet set. But we'll --\nQ: But you guys are actively considering it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've actively considered it every time the President has decided to travel to Japan. I think he's been there, what, three or four times now, Mark, as President? I don't mean to put you on the spot there. (Laughter.) The President has been to Japan three or four times as President. And each time the President has traveled there, this question has come up and we've considered it each time.\nQ: Has the President spoken directly with Secretary Kerry about the merits of a visit to Hiroshima after his trip? Or has the President reached out to his ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, about what she thinks about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly Ambassador Kennedy and her office have been involved in planning our trip. I don't know whether or not the President has had a specific conversation with Secretary Kerry since he returned from his trip to Hiroshima just a few weeks ago. But this is something that we're considering.\nBut again, we're not considering it for the first time. This is something that -- this is a question that has come up every time the President has planned to travel to Japan.\nQ: Final thing on that. There have been a number of op-eds written since Secretary Kerry visited -- from The New York Times and The Washington Post -- that were in favor; the Weekly Standard and others I think were against it. But Wendy Sherman I think had an op-ed encouraging the President to go -- published by CNN -- a former high-ranking State Department official familiar with nuclear issues. I'm wondering if the President is monitoring that coverage on how the administration overall, the West Wing feels about sort of the reaction on net to John Kerry's visit and these calls for the President to go.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has read each of the materials that you've just described. But he's certainly aware of the public debate that consideration of a visit like this has prompted. And that's entirely appropriate. But until we make -- it's a little hard to talk about until we've made a decision one way or the other.\nQ: Do you know on net that the general sentiment favors -- is supporting a trip, whether you go or not?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's hard to tell at this point. But I think once we've made a decision, we'll be prepared to explain how we arrived at that decision once we've announced it.\nChris, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Great. On the President today engaging in media interviews to encourage Senate action on Judge Garland, there's another nominee the full Senate hasn't acted on since he was named by the President nearly six months ago -- Eric Fanning for Army Secretary. Will the President employ the same effort to get him confirmed?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly will continue to make clear that he believes that Mr. Fanning would serve with distinction as Secretary of the Army.\nMr. Fanning is somebody that has extensive experience at the Department of Defense. He's served in a number of roles there. And he would bring that experience and that judgement to the Secretary's office. The President believes that he is exactly the right person for the job. And it's unconscionable for Republicans to continue to block his nomination for no good reason.\nQ: Last week, Senator McCain attempted to get a vote on the nominee, but he was blocked by Senator Roberts, who has placed a hold on the nomination. What is the White House strategy for convincing Senator Roberts to lift the hold on Fanning?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the White House has made a strong and effective case to Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that Mr. Fanning deserves confirmation. And we'll continue to make that argument on the merits to everyone who continues to try to block his nomination.\nQ: Senator Roberts mentioned on the floor a phone call he received from the White House on the nomination. What did that consist of?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not privy to that phone call. I can't confirm that it occurred. We're going to continue to make a strong case on the merits that our national security would be enhanced by the Senate confirming the Secretary of the Army, particularly when it's somebody as distinguished as Mr. Fanning.\nQ: And given Senator Roberts's voting record, and the fact that Eric Fanning would be the first openly gay person to serve as Army Secretary, do you think sexual orientation is a factor on this hold?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no idea what the motivations are of Republicans to unfairly block the nomination of a patriotic American to this critical national security post.\nQ: It's public record that Senator Roberts voted against \"don't ask, don't tell\" repeal; against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act; in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide. Doesn't that raise questions about the motivations behind this hold?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no idea what his motivations are. I can tell you that his actions, though, are wrong. Mr. Fanning is a distinguished public servant. He's a patriotic American. He's been nominated by the President of the United States to a critically important job. And the Senate should stop obstructing that nomination.\nMark, I put you on the spot earlier, so I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Okay, thanks. What can you tell us about the five hours that the President spent yesterday with the Obama Foundation?\nMR. EARNEST: Not much. I can tell you that the President was visiting with architects who had submitted designs related to his presidential library. But this is a process that's been administered by the foundation. So I'd refer you to them for specific questions about that process.\nQ: Why did he leave the White House for that meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that there is an opportunity to make these presentations. And it was concluded that for logistical reasons it would be easier to convene that series of meetings offsite.\nQ: Was he doing fundraising?\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, he was not.\nQ: Has he started doing fundraising?\nMR. EARNEST: He has not. He has not. The President has made clear that he won't be raising money for the foundation until after he leaves office.\nQ: And one other question. Is the White House upset about China's decision not to let the Stennis carrier group have a port visit in Hong Kong?\nMR. EARNEST: It's my understanding -- you should check with the Department of Defense on this -- I know that even as the Chinese made that announcement, there actually was a U.S. naval vessel that had made a port of call in Hong Kong. So it does not appear to be a significant change in policy that they're administering. But obviously the Stennis carrier group has made a port of call in Hong Kong before. But I can't speak to what the Chinese government may have had in mind by denying this request.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:10 P.M.

Bernie Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, on Monday criticized a Hillary Clinton campaign fundraising scheme that state party leaders told Politico has been used as a self-serving \"money-laundering\" conduit.\nDespite Clinton's pledges to rebuild state parties, Politico found that less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by the Victory Fund has stayed in the state parties' coffers.\n\"Secretary Clinton is looting funds meant for the state parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign,\" Weaver said. \"We think the Clinton campaign should let the state parties keep their fair share of the cash.\"\nSanders' and Clinton's primary campaigns both raised about $26 million in April, but Politico documented how the Hillary Victory Fund, a supposedly joint fundraising committee, has been exploited to inflate her presidential primary campaign.\n\"Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways that let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Wal-Mart fame and the actor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits on campaign contributions,\" Weaver added. \"If Secretary Clinton can't raise the funds needed to run in a competitive primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donald Trump in a general election?\"\nThe Sanders campaign first raised questions about the arrangement in an April 18 letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders' campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC.\n\"Hillary Clinton says that campaign finance reform is one of the most important issues facing our country but her campaign's use of the Victory Fund to essentially launder money proves otherwise,\" Weaver said. \"You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next.\"\nSanders last month raised money for three progressive Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. Unlike the Hillary Victory Fund, every dollar went directly to helping the candidates.

Bernie Sanders addressed supporters at an outdoor rally on a chilly spring Monday evening hours before polls were to open for Indiana's closely-watched presidential primary election.\nA crowd of more than 7,800 ringed the brick-paved street half way around the capital city's landmark Monument Circle.\nIt was the third big rally of the day for Sanders. He spoke earlier Monday to more than 3,000 people each in Evansville and Fort Wayne as he crisscrossed the state in an election eve campaign blitz.\nHere in Indianapolis, Sanders contrasted his record to Hillary Clinton's on how they finance their campaigns. He has relied on more than 7.4 million donations while she is bankrolled by big-dollar donors. He supports a tax on carbon and a nationwide ban on fracking to combat climate change. She doesn't. He called for a tax on Wall Street speculation to pay for his proposal to provide tuition-free public colleges and universities and to help those struggling with heavy student debt loads refinance their loans. She doesn't.\nHe also focused on the core economic issues and proposals to end a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system. \"We are going to create an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1 percent,\" he said.\nHe called for more than doubling the minimum wage to $15 an hour. \"In the United States of America if you work 40 hours a week you should not live in poverty. He said there should be pay equity for women workers who are paid just 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. He promised to rewrite trade policies that have encouraged corporations to send jobs to low-wage nations overseas. The most recent example of how trade policies have failed American workers is the decision of United Technologies the owner of Carrier to ship 2,100 jobs from Indiana to Monterey, Mexico, He denounced the greed of the Connecticut-based United Technologies for its plan to ship Indiana jobs to Mexico and throw Indiana workers out of their jobs.\nIn Evansville earlier in the day, Sanders spoke about the $25 million Clinton took in donations from Wall Street and other special interests.\nHe also renewed his call for Clinton to release transcripts of speeches she gave behind closed doors to Goldman Sachs and other corporations for lucrative fees totaling more than $2 million.", "timestamp": "2016-05-02", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Caps Indiana Campaign at Monument Circle Rally"}

{"author": "John Kasich", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117291", "text": "Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich's campaign plans. Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention. The comments from Trump, on the verge of winning in Indiana, heighten the differences between Governor Kasich and his positive, inclusive approach and the disrespectful ramblings from Donald Trump.\nPrior to tonight's primary, the Kasich campaign had already secured a large plurality of Indiana delegates committed to Governor Kasich at a multi-ballot convention as part of the pre-primary delegate selection process.\nThe Indianapolis Star wrote about our success two weeks ago. You can read about it (here).\nGov. Kasich will remain in the race unless a candidate reaches 1,237 bound delegates before the Convention.\nHere's why:\nI. Gov. Kasich remains the candidate best positioned to win a contested convention.\nA plurality of Trump delegates will support him after the first ballot.\nHe can unite the Party better than anyone else. Trump's cynical sowing of division will render the GOP into angry, irrelevant status for decades.\nII. Gov. Kasich is the only Republican who can win in November.\nDelegates want to win in November, and only Gov. Kasich can defeat Hillary Clinton. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average Clinton leads Trump by more than 6 points on average. Meanwhile, Gov. Kasich leads Clinton by over 7 points. A Trump nomination means the end of a Republican Congress and scores of local, legislative and state constitutional offices will be lost for a generation.\nIII. Gov. Kasich offers Republicans and Americans a refreshing choice of hope, inclusion and conservative reform.\nNearly 60 percent of GOP voters have voted for a candidate other than Donald Trump. Republican primary voters deserve to have a choice in the remaining contests and we intend to forcefully give them one. Americans overwhelmingly want to vote for Governor Kasich in a general election. A detailed analysis of the Electoral College confirms Governor Kasich is the only one who can win. Both Trump and Cruz would lose to Clinton by considerable margins in a head-to-head race, winning just 210 and 206 Electoral College votes, respectively. By contrast, Kasich comfortably defeats Clinton, racking up 304 Electoral College votes to her 234. Read the full analysis (here).\nIV. The future of the Republican Party and America is at stake. Gov. Kasich will not simply give up.\nThe Mad Hatter Gibberish pushed by Trump during the primary would weaken America. His proposals would divide us, put American workers in the unemployment line and put our national security at risk. And a Clinton presidency would be at least four more years of international drift, a liberal Supreme Court, and more big government at the expense of job creators, entrepreneurs and families.\nV. Gov. Kasich has the experience, vision and leadership abilities needed in our next President.\nA Kasich Presidency means a conservative Supreme Court; the return of money, power and influence to the states; a balanced budget and tax reduction, unleashing job creators; faith that our nation's challenges can be solved by families and local communities; and a White House that prioritizes doing what's right over what's political expedient.\nThis is the stark choice that confronts Republicans between now and when a nominee is chosen in Cleveland. Gov. Kasich looks forward to continuing to compete with Donald Trump in the upcoming primaries through California on June 7th.", "timestamp": "2016-05-03", "title": "Press Release - What's Next"}

Kennedy High School in Waterbury, CT; and Daniel Abell, teacher, Midlothian High School in Midlothian, VA.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117616", "text": "The President. Thank you. Well, welcome to the White House. And thank you, Jahana, for that wonderful introduction. Everybody, please give the National Teacher of the Year a big round of applause. It's a little surprising that she got this award because you can tell she's a little shy—[laughter]—and lacks enthusiasm. [Laughter] And yet somehow, she seems to be performing pretty well in the classroom. [Laughter] Look at that smile.\nSo for 7 years, I've stood in the White House with America's finest public servants and private-sector innovators and our best advocates and our best athletes and our best artists, and I have to tell you there are few moments that make me prouder than this event when I stand alongside our Nation's best educators. You know, I—[applause].\nEvery year on this day, we say publicly as a country what we should be eager to say every day of the year, and that is, \"Thank you.\" That's what this event is about. That's why it's one of my favorites. It's a good day with all of you guys here in Washington to say thank you for the extraordinary work that teachers do all across the country. It's also, I guess, a pretty good day for substitute teachers because we've got a lot of folks—[laughter]—we got a lot of folks playing hooky today. [Laughter] This is a school day. [Laughter]\nNational Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes. This is a learning opportunity. [Laughter]\nThe President. It's a field trip.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Now, among our country's best educators happens to be our Secretary of Education, Dr. John King, Jr. John is someone who, like Jahana, found refuge in school as a youngster. And he found role models in the classroom at a time when he needed them most. And that experience instilled in him the empathy that makes him such a powerful voice for students and for teachers and for principals and superintendents and educators all across the country.\nI also want to acknowledge Jahana's Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy. He's around here somewhere. There he is. He's proud of you too.\nI want to welcome her fellow Teachers of the Year from all 50 States, DC, and our Territories. And we want to welcome the hundreds of distinguished educators from all across the country that joined us this afternoon. So thank you.\nI figured this is the last time I was going to do this, so I wanted to invite as many of you as possible, because you are people who are inspiring at every grade level, who are opening minds to math and music; to basic literacy, but also classic literature; to social studies and science, Spanish and special education.\nIn their daily lives, the men and women who teach our children fulfill the promise of a nation that's always looking forward, that believes each generation has a responsibility to help the next in building this great country of ours and making the world a better place. President Kennedy said, \"Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education.\" Now, the school where Jahana teaches happens to bear President Kennedy's name. And it's fitting then that the perspective, the approach that she brings to the classroom suits the philosophy that he articulated.\nThis is what Jahana said about how she approaches her responsibility: \"It doesn't matter how bright a student is or where they rank in a class or what colleges they have been accepted to if they do nothing with their gift to improve the human condition.\" And Jahana cares about the example she sets as much as the exams that she scores.\n[At this point, Ms. Hayes began to applaud energetically.]\nAll right, you just need to settle down. [Laughter] This is what makes her a great teacher. You can't be great if you're not enthusiastic. [Laughter] You've got to love what you do, and she loves what she does.\nAnd what's remarkable about Jahana's natural talent in the classroom is that when she was growing up in Waterbury, Connecticut, being a teacher was the furthest thing from her mind. In fact, there were times where she didn't even want to be a student.\nNo one in Jahana's family had gone to college. No one at home particularly encouraged education. She lived in a community full of poverty and violence, high crime and low expectations. And drugs were more accessible than degrees. As a teenager, Jahana became pregnant and wanted to drop out of school. But her teachers saw something. They saw something in her. And they gave her an even greater challenge, and that was to dream bigger and to imagine a better life. And they made her believe she was college material and that she had the special gift to improve not only her own condition, but those around her.\nAnd today, Jahana's principal at Kennedy High says she gets through to her students precisely because she remembers what it's like to be one of them. And she doesn't forget that everyone in her class brings their own different and sometimes difficult circumstances. And she meets them where they are. And she sees a grace in them, and she sees a possibility in them. And because she sees it, they start seeing it.\nAnd that's what makes Jahana more than a teacher; she's a counselor and a confidant. That's how a woman who became a teenage mom is now a mentor to high schoolers in the same city where she grew up.\nAnd meanwhile, outside of the classroom, Jahana has been a leader in the afterschool theater program. She put together a \"Teen Idol\" singing show. [Laughter] She won the school's \"Dancing With the Stars\" competition. [Laughter] I wish I had met you before I started tangoing in Argentina. [Laughter] Could have given me some tips.\nAnd this is something that I think is particularly remarkable: Jahana inspires her students to give back. I think she understands that actually sometimes the less you have, the more valuable it is to see yourself giving, because that shows you the power and the influence that you can bring to bear on the world around you.\nOne year, she had been assigned to a group that seemed unmotivated, so she found out what was distracting them. Seven students in one class had recently lost a parent to cancer. So she organized a Relay for Life team through the American Cancer Society, and it became an annual event. Last year, when Jahana went online to register her team, she noticed not 1, not 2, but 14 teams led by former students had already signed up. She organized her students to walk for autism, to feed the homeless, to donate clothes, to clean neighborhoods, and even to register voters. And so it takes a unique leader to get students who don't have a lot to give of themselves. But because Jahana understood those kids, she knew not to set low expectations, but to set high ones and to say to them, you can make a difference.\nAnd that's the kind of leader our Teacher of the Year is. She knows that if students learn their worth, then the class rank and the college acceptances and the exam scores will follow.\nNow, if there's one thing Jahana wishes she had in school, it was more teachers who looked like her, as she already mentioned. And so she wrote and won a State grant to inspire more students to become teachers, but especially to recruit more Black and Latino teachers in her district. And that's important.\nAnd not one of the teachers standing behind me or in front of our children's classrooms chose this profession because they were promised a big payday or a short workday. [Laughter] Although, you all do need to be paid better. That I believe. But the main reason teachers do what they do is because they love kids. They love our kids. And yes, we should pay teachers more because what they do is invaluable and essential. And the teachers here, though, will tell you that what would be most helpful, in addition to a little financial relief, would be people understanding how important the work you do is and to appreciate it and not take it for granted.\nAnd so part of the reason this event is so important is for us to be able to send a message to future generations of teachers, to talented young people all across the country to understand this is a dream job; that this is an area where you will have more influence potentially than any other profession that you go into.\nAudience member. Say it again! [Laughter]\nThe President. This is a profession where you have the potential to make more of a difference than just about anything you can go into.\nSo, over the past 7 years, we've looked at every element of our education system with an eye towards boosting the teaching profession. And thanks to our educators and the opinions you've voiced and the leadership that you've shown, we've come a long way since we came into office.\nOne of the first things we did, in the middle of the worst economic crisis in generations, when States and cities were slashing budgets, was to keep more than 300,000 educators in our kids' classrooms. That was part of the Recovery Act.\nWe've taken the first steps towards making sure every young person in America gets the best start possible. And keep in mind that in 2009, when I started here, only 38 States had their own preschool programs. Today, all but four have. We've expanded Head Start programs for tens of thousands of kids who need it.\nWe made turning around America's low-performing schools a national priority. The year before I took office, a quarter of our high school students didn't graduate on time. More than a million didn't finish high school at all. And today, high school graduations rates have never been higher, dropout rates have gone down. We're transforming hundreds of America's lowest performing schools. We're also bringing new technology and digital tools to our classrooms to modernize and personalize learning. Three years ago, less than a third of all school districts could access high-speed Internet, and a lot of low-income communities were left behind. Today, 20 million more students and most of our school districts have fast broadband and wireless in the classroom. And by 2018, we're going got make sure that we reach the goal I set: 99 percent of our students will have high-speed Internet.\nWe're making remarkable progress towards my pledge to train 100,000 STEM teachers by 2021 thanks to the great work of \"10,000K [100K; White House correction.] in 10,\" which, with new commitments to prepare 70,000 more teachers, I want to just announce today, this is a goal that we are going to achieve on time. We're on our way.\nAnd we unleashed a Race to the Top, convincing every State to raise its standards so students are prepared for success in college and for future careers. And we listened to parents who wanted subjects like computer science taught in our schools. And we listened to teachers who have shown why cookie-cutter solutions don't always work. We're empowering States and communities to set their own standards for progress with accountability. And because nobody thinks our students need to spend more time filling in bubbles on standardized tests, we're starting to give educators like those behind me the flexibility to spend more time teaching creatively than they're spending teaching to a test.\nNow, that doesn't mean that all our problems are solved. You'd know it better than I do. In too many States, we are underfunding public education. And it is the job of State legislators and of Governors to recognize that the well-being of their State and their communities and their families and their kids requires them to step up. In too many school districts, we still have schools that, despite great efforts by a lot of great teachers, are still not getting our kids prepared the way they need to be prepared. And we've got to be willing to be honest when something is not working and say, all right, let's try something different. And sometimes, we won't necessarily get it right the first time.\nBut the reason I think—I want to bring this up. This wasn't in my prepared remarks—[laughter]—but I think it's important. So often now, the debate swings back and forth. You've got some folks who say resources and money don't make a difference, and the problem is all the teachers' unions. And they want to break up the schools, and they think vouchers are all the answer, or some other approach. And then, on the other side, you've got folks who just know that argument is wrong, but too often it sounds like it's just a defense of the status quo.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, is that we do have to do better in too many of our schools. We need more teachers like this in all of you. We've got to make the profession more attractive. We do have to have accountability in the classroom. That doesn't mean forcing you to teach to the test, but we've got to come up with measures that are meaningful so that if somebody doesn't have the skills that Jahana or these other teachers have, that they can start developing it and we know what to look for. We've got to make sure that we're setting our sights high.\nAnd although I am very proud of the work that we've done, I know we're not there yet. And we may have replaced No Child Left Behind, which was a relief for a lot of folks, but the absence of something that wasn't working as well as it should is not the presence of the kind of work that remains to be done.\nSo, in our country, it's a little harder than in some other countries, because we've got diverse populations, and we've got folks coming from different backgrounds and starting off in tougher circumstances. But our Teacher of the Year here stands as proof that you can't set expectations high enough for our kids. There's magic in those kids. We just have to find it. We have to unleash it. We have to nurture it. We have to support it. We have to love them. And then, we have to tell them precisely because we love you, you're going to work harder—[laughter]—and you're going to do better. And we're going to stay on you.\nThat's what we have to do. And we can't just leave it to the teachers, because if our notion is we drop off our kids and then the teacher is doing everything, and then our job is done, it's not going to work.\nSo this is why my administration launched Teach To Lead, to give teachers a greater voice in the policies that affect them every day.\nAnd I'm going to close by just talking about a letter I received at the beginning of this school year from a teacher in Central Virginia named Danny Abell.\nAudience member. Let's hear it!\nThe President. There's Danny. That's Danny. There's a reason why he got a good spot—[laughter]—because he knew I was going to talk about him. So Danny asked his students if any of them wanted to be a teacher when they grew up. And no one raised their hands. And that worried him. So he wrote me to ask what I'd say if one of my daughters told me she wanted to become a teacher. And I mean this—this is the God's honest truth—if Sasha or Malia wanted to be teachers, I will tell them, I could not be prouder of what you've done. And I'd tell them to be the kind of teachers who don't just show her students how to get the correct answer, but how to be curious about the world and how to care for the people around her and how to analyze facts and evidence and how to tell stories, and how to believe in their ability to shape their own destiny.\nIn other words, I'd tell her to be like Jahana and to be like each of the educators behind us here today and the kinds of teachers that you see in classrooms in every State and every Territory and the District of Columbia. I'm so proud of all of you for the high standards you set for your students, for your fellow teachers. Thank you for making our Nation stronger.\nAnd now, Jahana, please join me to accept this award from America's educators—the crystal apple—as the National Teacher of the Year.", "timestamp": "2016-05-03", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2016 National Teacher of the Year and State Teachers of the Year"}

Thanks to the hard work of our teachers, students, parents, and state and local leaders, that commitment is paying off in new opportunities for our communities and our country.\nToday, on National Teacher Appreciation Day, we say thank you to the leaders in our classrooms and reaffirm our shared belief that all children, no matter where they live or what they look like, can grow up to be whatever they want. A world-class education is the single most important factor in making that possible. It determines not just whether our children can compete for the best jobs, but whether America can out-compete other countries.\nAt the beginning of my Administration, we set an ambitious goal to once again lead the world in our share of college graduates. By reforming our education system from cradle to career, and with the help of a newly announced $100 million down payment to help expand free community college programs and connect college graduates to in-demand jobs, we're on our way to realizing that goal.\nWe're also proud that high school graduation rates are at an all-time high and dropout rates are at historic lows. Across the board, we're raising expectations for everyone from the Congress to the classroom—but we didn't stop there. We've also raised standards so they are rigorous and relevant.\nIt starts in our children's youngest years. We set a goal to expand high-quality early education investments in every child. Over the last three years, 38 states have increased those investments.\nWe're also making sure our students have access to a well-rounded education—that includes exposure to a variety of classes, from computer skills and reading to science and math. We've cut our schools' digital divide in half, and today 20 million more students—including many in low-income communities—can access high-speed internet and the modern learning tools it provides.\nMindful of the needs of businesses in high-growth and high-demand industries, and true to the principle that a quality education cannot be a privilege for the few, we also proposed a plan that offers two years of free community college to anyone willing to work for it. We're also proud that there are 1 million more black and Latino students in college than there were at the start of my Administration.\nAt the center of all this progress are the teachers we celebrate year-round, including today. Like those who made a difference in my life, our students' teachers are the ones who help them discover, dream, believe in themselves, and realize the potential our nation promises. That's why one of the most important priorities of my Administration has been to ensure every classroom has a great teacher. To do that, we've reviewed every element of our education system—from standards to assessments to how we train, support, and reward our teachers—to bolster our national effort to improve the teaching profession. As part of that progress, we are on track to train 100,000 more outstanding math and science teachers by 2021.\nOur teachers deserve credit for each of our accomplishments and the progress we're continuing to make, from better early education and higher standards to better student performance and higher graduation rates.\nLike so many patriotic public servants driven by the reward of giving back, our educators didn't choose their field because of the big paychecks, easy work, or short hours. They are passionate about helping our students realize the best versions of themselves so our country can become the best version of itself. Time and again our teachers have met this solemn responsibility, even as we've asked more of them than ever before.\nIn our changing world, our sons' and daughters' best job qualification isn't what they do—it's what they know. Our commitment to their education means giving them the knowledge they need to thrive and lead. It is a commitment to prepare them not only to get good jobs, but also to be good citizens—not just to know the correct answer, but to be curious and caring about the world around them.\nThe future belongs to the nation that best educates its people. If we continue building on the progress we've made over the past seven years, I'm confident we will continue to be that nation.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-03", "title": "Statement on Education Reform"}

EARNEST: Why don't I just give you a little bit of a rundown on the day, and then we can go into your questions.\nThe President is joined on the plane today by a couple of members of the Michigan congressional delegation. So Congressman Debbie Dingell and Congressman Dan Kildee are on board. There are also senior administration officials who have been playing an important role in responding to the situation in Flint also on board. Those are Secretary of HHS Sylvia Burwell, the Administrator of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, and Dr. Nicole Lurie, who is an assistant secretary at Health and Human Services. She has been the lead federal official on the ground in Flint as we've coordinated a significant federal response to this situation.\nWhen we arrive in Flint, we anticipate that Governor Snyder and Mayor Weaver will both be on the ground to welcome the President to Michigan. The President will first head to a location -- this food bank in Flint that has been a hub of activity in providing some needed relief and supplies to citizens in Flint. While there, the President will meet with a wide range of federal officials who have been working on the ground to coordinate the federal response. The President will receive a briefing about that federal response. Both Mayor Weaver and Governor Snyder will participate in that meeting, because the focus of our efforts has not just been to mobilize federal resources, but to ensure that they have been effectively integrated with the resources that have been mobilized by state and local officials, as well. You'll have an opportunity to hear from the President during that meeting, either before or after. I'm not sure if that spray will be at the top or the bottom.\nFrom there, we'll travel to a local high school where the President will have an opportunity to sit down and visit with six or eight members of the community to talk to a cross-section of the community about how they've been affected by the situation. And we'll do a brief pool spray there so you can at least get photographs of the President doing that meeting.\nFrom there, the President will then deliver remarks to about 1,000 people from the community that will be in attendance at his speech. And that will be the end of the day, and then we'll head back.\nSo that's what we're looking at. I think the message that you can anticipate from the President is something that will be familiar to all of you. The President will make a strong case that he cares deeply about the challenges facing the community of Flint. He will make clear that America is strongest when we're looking out for one another and that we have an obligation as a country to look out for everybody, including people in Flint who are dealing with some pretty tough circumstances even before there was these significant problems exposed in their water system.\nSo the President will make clear once again that this administration will continue to help mobilize resources necessary that will allow Flint to recover and come back stronger than ever. And he'll be focused on that even after broader national attention moves on to other things.\nQ: Can I ask you about -- you said 1,000 people. I mean, that seems more like a rally or some sort. I mean, who are the people, and how come so many? What are you trying to do with that crowd?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the goal of the President's visit is for the President to deliver a message to the people in the community there. And we wanted to find a venue that would allow as many people as possible from the community in Flint to hear from their President firsthand, and to hear from their President directly.\nAnd so he'll obviously have an opportunity to have a conversation with members of the community in a smaller setting, but we also wanted to provide a setting where the President could deliver a message in person to the people of Flint.\nQ: And do you know how the tickets were distributed or who got the tickets?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't, but we can get you some more information about that.\nQ: So there were a bunch of folks in a story that we posted on our website earlier today from the community that one of my colleagues talked to -- very critical of the EPA and the federal government as much as they are of the state government, as well. One woman was asked about President Obama coming and she said, \"Great, that sounds wonderful, bring a check.\" And very frustrated that they don't have the resources to deal with the situation. What's his answer to that, and to that frustration generally?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think considering that many of the people in this community were serving poisoned water to their children for a year and a half or two years, their frustration is entirely justified. And I think the President is going to make clear that this isn't just an isolated incident of mismanagement. This also is reflective -- or this also reflects the dangers of government at all levels losing touch with the people that they were elected to serve.\nAnd I think it is evident from the administration's response that the President is quite serious about making sure that the federal government is living up to its obligations to our citizens. We need Congress to take some common-sense steps here to make sure that the people of Flint and the state of Michigan has the resources it needs to address this problem.\nThus far we've seen Republicans in Congress not act as aggressively as they should to respond to this situation. There is more that Congress needs to do, and there is a role for Congress to play. And the commission that was established by the Governor to take a look at this situation ascribed almost all of the blame to failures by state regulators. And this is not an exercise in finger pointing, but an exercise in asserting the responsibility that everybody has to make sure that the people of Flint have an opportunity to get back on their feet.\nQ: Yesterday, Governor Snyder called on the President to drink the water while he's in Flint. If he does decide to do that, does it send the wrong message that things are kind of okay?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think -- look, I don't think there's anybody that thinks that what's been happening in Flint is okay. I think what is true is that there have been important steps that have been taken -- both by state and federal officials -- that have made the water safe to drink if it's been properly filtered.\nAnd that's why you've had federal officials including from FEMA, but also a number of state officials, including law enforcement passing out water filters to people in the community so they can get access to clean, drinkable water. The President will follow the advice of our scientists and experts about whether or not the water is safe to drink. And the EPA and state regulators have both indicated that properly filtered water is safe to drink.\nI don't know if the President is going to drink any filtered water in Flint or not, but he won't be avoiding it because it's not necessary for him to do so. The water is safe to drink if it's been properly filtered.\nQ: How does the President plan to keep the attention on Flint and the aid flowing after the cameras leave?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he certainly has given very clear instructions to his team that follow-through here is going to be critical. And over the last three months or so, I think we've seen quite effective follow-through on the part of federal officials. Nine million liters of water has been distributed. Hundreds of thousands of filters and filter cartridges have been distributed through the community. Those are resources that were mobilized largely by the federal government. You've seen steps taken by the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to Medicaid to ensure that people can get access to health care up to the age of 21. They've increased funding for community health centers to make sure that those new patients have doctors that they can see and facilities where those exams can be conducted.\nSo an aggressive federal response on the part of this administration has been mobilized. It's had an impact and an important impact, a positive one. The President is proud of that. But this is a situation that shouldn't have existed in the first place. And the President wants to have a discussion about what we can do to make sure that situations like Flint don't crop up in other communities.\nI can tell you the President does not believe that eliminating the EPA, for example, is going to prevent this from happening in other places. We need an EPA that's properly funded and that's functioning effectively and properly coordinating with state-level officials to protect our air and water. Eliminating that agency, as many Republicans advocate, is not going to contribute to that goal. I think we can all agree on that.\nQ: So, Josh, in terms of new resources, the administration has done as much as it can right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I pointed out, the administration has mobilized significant resources. We've expedited infrastructure funding that could be used by the state of Michigan to benefit people in Flint. Millions of dollars in emergency relief has been provided -- both in the form of personnel who were working on the ground, but also in the form of bottled water and medical supplies, and water filters -- all of which reflects the resources of the American people, making sure that an American community is not left behind.\nBut there is more that needs to be done to address the root problem here. And the President is committed to following through in pressing for those solutions and pressing Congress to provide the necessary funding for those solutions. Thus far Republicans in Congress have blocked the kind of robust response that is clearly necessary.\nQ: Josh, Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I've heard of him.\nQ: Any comment on last night? He's the Republican nominee according to Reince Priebus. And this sort of frees the President up to start saying what he wants to say about him, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is no denying that the President will have an active role in the general election. There continues to be a -- there are additional contests ahead, particularly on the Democratic side. And there are six months until Election Day. And I'm confident that the President will spend many of those days between now and Election Day making a strong case about the progress that our country has made over the last seven years.\nIt was President Ronald Reagan who laid out the central question that voters should ask themselves when they walk into the polling place: Are you better off than you were four years ago?\nI think it is undeniable that our country is stronger, our economy is stronger, is safer than it was eight years ago. And so the question that voters will have to ask themselves is, do we want to scrap the strategy that's worked so effectively, or do we want to build on the progress that we've made. And based on the amount of time and energy that President Obama has invested in avoiding a second Great Depression and rescuing the auto industry, growing our economy from the middle out, investing in job training, cutting taxes and making tax cuts permanent for middle-class families, and raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, mobilizing the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and to act to fight climate change -- I think the President's record is clear. And the President is going to be eager not just to defend that record, but also to advocate that the American people elect a 45th President that's committed to building on that progress.\nQ: Is the White House concerned at all that the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, continues to lose states this late in the Democratic primary? I mean, is this a sign that there's any weaknesses going into obviously what's going to be a tough battle against probably Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, in each of these states, there are competitive contests. And that's been the case for a couple of months now. I think what is -- there are a number of conclusions that can be drawn about that process. I think an important one is that in every state that we have seen, exit polls indicate that Democratic voters have been excited and motivated by the choices that are on the ballot for them. The exit polls of Republican voters tell a different story. And I think that's a consequence of the different kinds of campaigns that have been waged by candidates in the two parties.\nBut look, ultimately the voters are going to have to draw their own conclusions. But there's no denying that the competitive Democratic contest has had a positive effect in engaging and motivating and exciting Democratic voters all across the country.\nQ: Josh, even if it goes to a contested convention, would the President support something like a contested convention? Do you think that would be healthy for the party to keep the competition all the way to the finish?\nMR. EARNEST: Most of the analysis that I have seen has indicated that that is not at all likely to happen.\nQ: What was the President's reaction to Senator Cruz dropping out last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that he had one.\nQ: He didn't have one, or you don't know what it is?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd be surprised if he had one.\nQ: Do you think he was watching the results come in, or watching sports?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that he was not watching the results come in.\nQ: On Syria, does the President have any plans to call President Putin about maybe pushing al-Assad to go a little softer on the opposition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any phone calls with President Putin that are planned. If one does get scheduled, we'll let you know after it has occurred. The President has had a number of occasions just over the last three or four months to strongly impress upon President Putin the need to persuade the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of a cessation of hostilities and engage constructively in the political talks that are being led by the U.N.\nFortunately, President Obama did succeed in persuading President Putin to intervene, and that's why we saw for several weeks the successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities that many people were skeptical about. So President Putin did it once before. He should do it again.\nQ: Josh, when we get back from this trip, the President will be appearing tonight at a gala for Asian Pacific Islanders. And it's a pretty large group, and I'm just wondering if the President has a specific message that he wants to deliver tonight. And this is not a group that's often talked about -- sort of as political prowess on national elections. I'm wondering if he's going to deliver a message about getting involved in the election cycle, really try to talk about the political season at all, or whether it's a different kind of message.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President will primarily focus on the important role that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make to our country. And this is primarily an opportunity to honor those public servants who have not just represented that community but served our country in an important way. Look, what's also undeniable is that the fastest-growing voting bloc in America are actually Asian Americans.\nSo I think you could anticipate that the President will also make a strong case that the values that he's been fighting for over the last seven years, and the progress that we've made over the last seven years has certainly benefitted Asian Americans all across the country. And that's a record to be proud of. It's certainly a record that the President is proud of, but it's also a record that Democrats in Congress can be proud of.\nQ: Josh, Congressman Kildee is on the plane. He's been trying to facilitate a meeting between Amir Hekmati, who's from Flint -- one of the Iranian hostages that was released -- and the President. Do you know if they're going to encounter each other today at all?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a plan for a meeting like that to occur. But I'll keep my eye out and see if I can give you a head's up if it does happen. Obviously, administration officials have been in frequent touch with the Hekmati family, both leading up to -- both in the years that he was held in captivity, but also in the immediate aftermath of his release. But I'm not aware of a plan for that kind of meeting to occur on this trip.\nQ: What about Little Miss Flint? Is she going to be at the roundtable?\nMR. EARNEST: Little Miss Flint will be participating in today's events, and the President is looking forward to the opportunity to meet her and to convey to her how inspired he was by her letter. This is a little girl who has taken action to defend her community. And I think that's an example I think that we all can at least take note of, if not follow.\nThank you, guys.\nEND 11:32 A.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 1:46 p.m. at the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117472", "text": "The President. All set? All right. Well, I just had the opportunity to meet with the Federal responders who have been on the ground here in Flint, joined by Governor Rick Snyder and Mayor Karen Weaver. And our discussion underscored how important it was for us to mount a whole-of-government effort across agencies and across levels of government to meet one core mission, and that is make sure that the people of Flint are healthy; that they've got safe water to drink and to use; that we are ensuring that we have a plan for the system to work over the long term; and that we are certain that our kids here in Flint are going to be able to take advantage of their talents and opportunities well into the future.\nSo we've got a short-term challenge, which is water, but we've also got a long-term challenge, which is making sure that the city of Flint can prosper going forward.\nI want to thank everybody who's participating. Everybody here has been working hard on the ground for months now to respond to this crisis. It's an all-hands-on-deck approach. And just to give you some examples of the work that's being done—FEMA is expanding its access —is expanding access to water and filters by providing water commodities to the State of Michigan. The EPA has been actively testing and monitoring the city's water and is providing technical assistance to the city to make sure that the water distribution system is safe again. The CDC is investigating concerns that we've heard from people about health symptoms that may have been connected to the water.\nSome good news: We're hoping that if it hasn't already happened, that it's going to happen shortly, that legislation is being passed by the State of Michigan that allows the Federal Government, in partnership with the State, to expand access to Medicaid and provide additional services to individuals under 21. So making sure that our kids are covered and have these additional services, as well as pregnant women. And I want to thank the State of Michigan, working with us, to develop that plan.\nThanks to the USDA, and Debbie Stabenow has been outstanding in guiding this. And obviously, the rest of the Michigan congressional delegation have worked hard on this as well. USDA is making sure that infants get the formula that they need and that children are getting access to healthy food.\nThere are a couple of things that I want to address to the press directly. I'm going to have a chance after this meeting to meet with a number of Flint families so that they can address directly to me their fears and concerns, as well as their hopes, and then I'll have a chance to speak to a larger audience after that. But a couple of things that I want to focus on right now. Number one is that it is really important, particularly with this expansion of Medicaid, that any parent in the city of Flint takes the time to check to make sure that their kids aren't affected, that they don't have elevated lead levels. And I know that that can be hard. Sometimes, folks have difficulty accessing the system. One of the things that we spent a lot of time talking about is, how do we make sure that there is enough community outreach so that people know that there are doctors out there and health providers who will see their children? But I want everybody in the city of Flint to just know that you should have your child checked, because although lead poisoning or lead impacts can be serious, what is also true is, is that there are a lot of ways to address whatever concerns are raised and to make sure that those kids are healthy and are thriving. So the key is to know, like any other situation where your kid might get sick or have some sort of environmental impact, you've got to know what's going on and then take the steps that are needed to make sure that they get the treatment or the help that they need. And if you don't know, then that could end up leading to problems.\nSo we're really going to emphasize parents accessing the expanded health care providers that are going to be available here in the city of Flint. That's point number one.\nPoint number two. I know that there is a lot of suspicion about whether or not the water coming out of people's taps in their homes are safe or whether they are still contaminated and still a problem. And I want to emphasize that the EPA has looked at this very carefully, and they are very confident that if you use a filter, then it is safe for kids over 6. We're still, out of an abundance of caution, recommending bottled water for children who are under the age of 6 or pregnant women. But if you're over 6, then, in fact, filtered water is safe, and it works. And that's not just the opinion of Federal agencies. A lot of independent studies have been done to confirm that the water is safe.\nSo, working with the State and the city, filters are now available for everybody in this city. And the key is for people to go ahead and access them and use them. And I'm going to emphasize this when I'm speaking to the larger audience: I understand why people might be mistrustful and concerned. But right now it is safe for you to install a filter in your home or to use a standalone filter and to go ahead and drink that water. But you've got to use it. And it's available to you for free. But people have to have confidence that will work.\nThat doesn't mean that we still don't have to replace a number of the pipes in this city. And the mayor is working hard on a plan to fast-track getting pipe replacement. And the Governor is budgeting dollars to expand that program. And the congressional delegation of Michigan is working hard so that we get additional funds to help replace those pipes that pose a threat. But that may be a long-term process. It may take a year. It may take 2 years. It might take more to get all the pipes replaced. And in the meantime, folks have to be able to use water. So trust that the tests have been done and the filter system works.\nThird point. In order for us to clean out the system, to flush out the contaminants and to have confidence that, as we fix the system, it's actually going to be safe for all the households in Flint, we need everybody in Flint to start helping us flush out that system. And so I guess there's a program called Flush——\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Regina McCarthy. Flush for Flint.\nThe President. Flush for Flint. [Laughter] It's not the most elegant name. [Laughter] But the concept is pretty simple if you think about it, and that is, we need everybody to turn on their tap in the kitchen, in the tub, for 5 minutes a day so that the water is running and whatever contaminants are sitting in there start getting pushed out.\nAnd what that allows us to do is then to go back after some water has been running and the flushing has taken place, then the EPA can go back and test some more and see, all right, where are the levels now? How are we doing in terms of coating the pipes? Is—what steps being taken, are they being effective or do additional steps need to be taken? But we're not going to know that if people just let the water sit there. Now, I understand if people are scared and they're not using their water, that they may wonder why is it up to me to be part of this process of fixing it. But the bottom line is, is if you're not doing your part, then these outstanding folks around the table who want to help can't do theirs.\nSo I'm urging everybody in Flint to participate in this flushing program. Again, it's a matter of turning on your tap in the kitchen, in the bathroom, 5 minutes a day, just to get that water flowing, getting some of the contaminants out. It will then be retested after that. All right?\nNow, these are all short-term issues. And one of the things that we all emphasized here is that the city of Flint had suffered from some hard times and neglect long before this particular crisis. And what I'm encouraged by is, I think, a recognition at every level of government that we have to take what has been a crisis and see if we can turn this into an opportunity to rebuild Flint even better than before.\nThe problems of water were a symptom of a broader issue, and that is a city that had lost a lot of resources, lost a lot of its tax base, was cutting a lot of services, and increasingly, didn't have capacity. And so our goal here is to use this moment in which everybody's attention is focused to see if we can start rebuilding and moving Flint in a better direction.\nI'm confident that we can do that if we're all working together. And I emphasized to the Governor and I emphasized to the mayor that my job here today is not to sort through all the ins and outs of how we got to where we are, but rather to make sure that all of us are focused on what we need to do moving forward on behalf of the children of Flint. That's my priority. And that's got to be all of our priorities.\nAnd there are times for politics, and there are times for turf battles. This is not one of those times. This is where everybody locks arms and is focused on getting the job done. And I'm very proud of the team: Gina McCarthy at the EPA, Secretary Burwell at Health and Human Services, and everybody who is represented around this table. That's their commitment, and that's their order from me. And Dr. Lurie, who's been heading up the Federal response, I think, has been doing a great job in coordination here.\nBut all of us are going to have to really keep our eye on the ball, even when the cameras go away. That's what we owe to the people of Flint, and that's what we owe to their kids.\nLast point: I think people are understandably scared when they hear that their child may have ingested some lead, it may have gotten into their system, and that that may have some long-term impacts or create particular challenges for kids. But it is really important for all of us to remember that kids are resilient. And every kid in Flint is special and has capacity and can do great things. And the fact that they may have had some drinking water that was contaminated doesn't automatically mean somehow that they're going to have huge problems or that they're not going to be able to reach that potential.\nAnd so for the parents who are out there, I want to emphasize: Get your child checked, but be confident that your child can thrive and will be fine as long as you know what they need and know how to access the resources that they need. It's useful to remember, just to keep things in perspective, that the laws banning lead paint in homes and reducing the lead that was in our environment, those laws really were put in place just a generation ago.\nWhen I was 5 or 6 or 7, a lot of homes still had lead paint in it. I might have ingested some lead paint when I was 2 or 3 years old, because at the time, people didn't know it. So we've got an entire couple of generations of Americans who have done really well despite the fact that they may have had something that is not optimal. And how lead interacts with any particular child is going to be different, and what each child needs is going to be different. And some kids are going to be fine, and they're not going to be affected. Some kids may have more of an—it might have more of an effect.\nBut the bottom line is, is that we now know what to do. We know how to mitigate these effects. But parents and communities have to be proactive in order to assure that we're doing the right thing by our kids. We can't just sit back and feel panicked and feel scared. Those emotions are understandable. But if we want to make sure that our kids are properly taken care of, then we've got to be proactive and get out of—ahead of this thing.\nAll right? Thank you again, everybody, for the great work that you guys have done. Thank you, press. I will see you again in the larger rally.\nSafety of Filtered Water\nQ. Is that water there from Flint, sir?\nThe President. It is. There you go. Generally, I have not been doing stunts here, but you know—[laughter].\n[At this point, the President sipped from a glass of water]\nThe President. And this used a filter. The water around this table was Flint water that was filtered. And it just confirms what we know scientifically, which is that if you're using a filter, if you're installing it, then Flint water at this point is drinkable. That does not—I want to repeat—negate the need for us to go ahead and replace some of these pipes, because ultimately, you want a system in which you don't have to put a filter on it in order to be assured that it's safe.\nBut as a short-term measure, this is the right thing to do. And, frankly, it's going to be a lot more convenient than people traveling long distances to try to lug back a bunch of bottled water. All right?\nThank you, guys.", "timestamp": "2016-05-04", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting on the Federal Government's Water Crisis Response Efforts in Flint, Michigan, and an Exchange With Reporters"}

Well, it is good to be back in Flint, Michigan.\nAudience member. Obama!\nThe President. That's me! Yes. All right, settle down, everybody. [Laughter]\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. All right, let me do some business here. Let me begin by recognizing some of the guests who are here. Your mayor, Karen Weaver, is here. I know Governor Rick Snyder is here.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. No, no, no—because he's here to—we're doing some business here. Members of Congress are here, including your outstanding Senator, Debbie Stabenow. Flint's own Dan Kildee is here. Debbie Dingell is here. Brenda Lawrence is here. John Conyers is here. And Sandy Levin. An outstanding Michigan delegation. We've got Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who is the head of Health and Human Services, works for me. And Administrator Gina McCarthy is here as well. I want to thank Superintendent Bilal Tawwab and Principal Tim Green for their hospitality. And I want to thank all of you for being here.\nNow, not too long ago, I received a letter from a young lady, an 8-year-old girl named Mari Copeny. You may know her as \"Little Miss Flint.\"\nThose of you who have seats, please feel free to sit down so folks can see you—see behind you. If you don't have a seat, don't sit down. [Laughter]\nAnd like a lot of you, Mari has been worried about what happened here in Flint. She's worried about what it means for children like her. She's worried about the future of this city and this community.\nSo in the middle of a tragedy that should have never happened here in the United States of America—the denial of something as basic as clean, safe drinking water—this 8-year-old girl spoke out and marched and, like many of you, protested. As Mari was getting ready to hop on a bus to Washington, she wrote to ask if she could meet with me while she was in town. There she is.\nNow, I would have been happy to see Mari in Washington. But when something like this happens, a young girl shouldn't have to go to Washington to be heard. I thought her President should come to Flint to meet with her. And that's why I'm here: to tell you directly that I see you and I hear you, and I want to hear directly from you about how this public health crisis has disrupted your lives, how it's made you angry, how it's made you worried.\nAnd I just had a chance to meet with a few of your neighbors in a roundtable discussion, and I heard from them what I know a lot of you are feeling: that a lot of you are scared; that all of you—feel let down. And I told them that I understood why you'd be afraid, not just for yourself, but for your kids. I also wanted to come here, though, to tell you that I've got your back, that we're paying attention. So I met and heard directly from those who are leading the Federal response and who are working hard to make sure that Flint is whole again, to make sure that this proud city bounces back not just to where it was, but stronger than ever. And I want all of you to know I am confident that Flint will come back. I will not rest, and I'm going to make sure that the leaders, at every level of government, don't rest until every drop of water that flows to your homes is safe to drink and safe to cook with and safe to bathe in, because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United States of America.\nSo, as President, I've sent Flint the best resources our Federal Government has to support our State and local partners, the agencies that serve you; the agencies that specialize in health and housing and those that support small businesses and our kids' education, those that are responsible for the food that our children eat and, of course, the water we drink. Everybody is on duty. The National Guard is on duty. This is a hands-on-deck situation—all hands on deck. Because if there's a child who feels neglected on the north side of Flint or a family on the east side of this city who wonders whether they should give up on their hometown and move away, or an immigrant who wonders whether America means what we say about being a place where we take care of our own, that matters to all of us—not just in Flint, not just in Michigan, but all across America. Flint's recovery is everybody's responsibility. And I'm going to make sure that responsibility is met.\nSo I just talked with some of the team of responders that are on the ground to make sure that they're coordinating. And they're doing some incredible things. They've distributed enough water to fill more than three Olympic-sized swimming pools. They've distributed thousands of filters. They're helping students afford nutritious food that work against the contaminants in bad water. They're making sure new moms have access to instant infant formula that doesn't require water. They've expanded health services for children and pregnant women and education programs for Flint's youngest children. They're out there testing homes for lead and testing children for exposure to lead.\nBut like all our best responses in tough times, this is not a government effort alone. We need our businesses and nonprofits and philanthropies to step up. And what's incredible about Flint is how many volunteers have already been leading the way. You've got members of one union, UA Local 370, that have donated tens of thousands of dollars and 10,000 hours of their time. They've installed thousands of filters, hundreds of faucets by going door to door, night and day. They're not asking for anything in return, they're just doing the right thing.\nSo many Americans, here in Flint and around the country, have proven that you don't have to be a plumber or a pipefitter to pitch in—although it's very helpful if you're a plumber or pipefitter. [Laughter] So, in March, dozens of accountants teamed up with the American Red Cross to help residents recycle all the plastic water bottles that have been piling up. Religious and community groups are organizing supply drives, supporting families, offering free medical services.\nThe director of a local dance studio, I understand, found a creative way to help; she's letting people use her studio as a space to support one another by sharing their stories and realizing they're not alone. Even inmates at an Indiana prison came together to donate more than $2,500 to the people of Flint. And a second-grader from Virginia, a young man named Isiah Britt, set up a website to see if he could raise $500 for hand sanitizers to send to the kids at Eisenhower Elementary here in Flint. So Isiah, it's fair to say, surpassed his goal, because he raised $15,000. And he explained that the experience taught him, just because you're small \"doesn't mean you can't do big things.\"\nSo when you think of all those stories, it should be clear that the American people care about Flint. The American people are paying attention, and they care about you. And as is true when disasters strike in other ways, people pitch in, they come together. Because they imagine, \"All right, that could have been me.\" That's the good news.\nThe bad news is that this should not have happened in the first place. And even though the scope of the response looks sort of like the efforts we're used to seeing after a natural disaster, that's not what this was. This was a manmade disaster. This was avoidable. This was preventable.\nNow, I'm not here to go through the full history of what happened. Like a lot of manufacturing towns, Flint's economy has been taking hits for decades now: plants closing, jobs moving away. Manufacturing has shrunk. And that's made it harder for the city to maintain city services. And let's face it, government officials at every level weren't attentive to potential problems the way they should have been. So they start getting short staffed, they start getting a shrinking tax base, more demand for services. Things start getting strained, and there's not enough help from the outside. And then, when Flint's finances collapse, an emergency manager was put in place whose mandate was primarily to cut at all costs. And then, some very poor decisions were made. All these things contributed to this crisis. Many of you know the story.\nNow, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people in Flint. And this is not the place to sort out every screw-up that resulted in contaminated water. But I do think there is a larger issue that we have to acknowledge, because I do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude that exists in our politics and exists in our—too many levels of our government.\nAnd it's a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good, no matter what. It's a mindset that says environmental rules designed to keep your water clean or your air clean are optional or not that important or unnecessarily burden businesses or taxpayers. It's an ideology that undervalues the common good, says we're all on our own, and what's in it for me, and how do I do well, but I'm not going to invest in what we need as a community. And as a consequence, you end up seeing an underinvestment in the things that we all share that make us safe, that make us whole, that give us the ability to pursue our own individual dreams. So we underinvest in pipes underground. We underinvest in bridges that we drive on and the roads that connect us and the schools that move us forward.\nAnd this is part of the attitude; this is part of the mindset: We especially underinvest when the communities that are put at risk are poor or don't have a lot of political clout and so are not as often heard in the corridors of power.\nAnd this kind of thinking, this myth that government is always the enemy, that forgets that our government is us—it's us, that it's an extension of us, ourselves—that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that resulted in lead in your water. Because what happens is, it leads to systematic neglect. It leads to carelessness and callousness. It leads to a lot of hidden disasters that you don't always read about and aren't as flashy, but that over time, diminish the life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed. In one of the roundtables, I was listening to somebody—I think it was a pastor—who told me, you know, it made us feel like we didn't count. And you can't have a democracy where people feel like they don't count, where people feel like they're not heard.\nAnd that attitude ignores how this country was built, our entire history, which is based on the idea that we're all connected and that what happens in a community like Flint matters everybody and that there are things that we can only do together, as a nation, as a people, as a State, as a city, that no man is an island.\nWe've been debating this since the Republic began: What are our individual responsibilities and what are our collective responsibilities. And that's a good debate. But I've always believed what the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, said. He said we should do individually those things that we do best by ourselves. But through our government, we should do together what we can't do as well for ourselves.\nSo it doesn't matter how hard you work, how responsible you are, or how well you raise your kids, you can't set up a whole water system for a city. That's not something you do by yourself. You do it with other people. You can't hire your own fire department or your own police force or your own army. There are things we have to do together, basic things that we all benefit from.\nAnd that's how we invested in a rail system and a highway system. That's how we invested in public schools. That's how we invested in science and research. These how we invested in community colleges and land grant colleges like Michigan State.\nCan I get some water? Come on up here. [Applause] Give me some water. I want a glass of water. I want a glass of water. Sit down. I'm all right. I'm going to get a glass of water right here. Let's make sure we find one. It will be filtered. Hold on, I'm going to talk about that in a second. Settle down, everybody.\nWhere was I? We invested in our communities and our cities. And by making those investments in the common good, we invested in ourselves. That's the platform we create that allows each of us independently to succeed. That's what made America great.\nSo the people in Flint and across Michigan and around the country—individuals and church groups and non-for-profits and community organizations—you've proven that the American people will step up when required. And our volunteers, our non-for-profits, they're the lifeblood of our communities. We so appreciate what you do.\nBut volunteers don't build county water systems and keep lead from leaching into our drinking glasses. We can't rely on faith groups to reinforce bridges and repave runways at the airport. We can't ask second-graders, even ones as patriotic as Isiah Britt who raised all that money, to raise enough money to keep our kids healthy.\nYou hear a lot about government overreach, how Obama, he's for big government. Listen, it's not government overreach to say that our government is responsible for making sure you can wash your hands in your own sink or shower in your own home or cook for your family. These are the most basic services. There is no more basic element sustaining human life than water. It's not too much to expect for all Americans that their water is going to be safe.\nNow, where do we go from here?\nAudience member. [Inaudible] The President. Well, I'm still waiting for my water. [Laughter] Somebody obviously didn't hear me. Usually, I get my water pretty quick. Hold on a second. Now, the reason I know I'm okay is because I already had some Flint water. Here we go. I really did need a glass of water. This is not a stunt.\nNow, I'm going to talk about this. Everybody settle down. This is a feisty crowd. Hold on a second. All right, everybody settle down. I've got some serious points to make here.\nSo where do we go from here? Now, Mayor Weaver has a plan to fix the pipes in Flint. And unfortunately, because the State initially cut so many corners, it's going to end up being more expensive—much more expensive—now than it would have been to avert the disaster in the first place. But the good news is that Michigan does have funds it can use from the Federal Government to help Flint. The Governor indicated that in his budget he has put forward additional funds to replace the pipes. In order for it to happen—and I said this to the mayor and the Governor; I had them both in my car, the Beast—I told them I wasn't going to let either of them out until we figured this out. [Laughter] Had Secret Service surrounding everybody.\nBut what I said was, is that the city and the State and the Federal Government, everybody is going to have to work together to get this done. So it's not going to happen overnight. But we have to get started. We have to get the money flowing. We've got to work with our plumbers and pipefitters, but also train local residents and start getting apprenticeship programs going, so that even as we're trying to deal with this disaster, we're also, hopefully, lifting people up and giving them an opportunity for employment. Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint has the necessary resources.\nAnd so it's long past time that Flint has a well-managed, monitored, modern water system that protects not just against lead, but other contaminants. All right? So that's our goal. That's one goal.\nBut we've got to do more than just ensure the integrity and safety of your water for the long term. What we also have to do is work as one team—Federal, State, and local leaders, Democrats and Republicans—to address some of the broader issues that have been raised by this crisis. The Federal officials I met with today are committed to staying on the job until we get it done. But that requires the State of Michigan to step up and be fully invested in this process as well. Today's vote in Lansing to increase funding for health care was a good start.\nBut part of keeping the faith with the people of Flint means making sure that you're first in line for the jobs this effort will create. It means that since the State voted this afternoon to expand Medicaid, every child who lived in Flint while the water was bad needs to be able to get seen by a doctor, diagnosed, make sure that there's follow-up. We can't just promise it, we've got to deliver it. And that means everybody has got to cooperate. Everybody has got to cooperate.\nAnd keeping the faith with you also means the State has to step up and deliver the resources that will help not only fix the water, but transform Flint so that it is once again a functioning city with the capacity and the democratic structures to work. The city government has to be on a firm foundation. The mayor can't do it by herself. She's got to have a team and a staff, and there's got to be a budget that works, that's sustainable, and a plan for long-term economic development and a plan to make sure that health care is available to all of our kids and a plan to make sure that education is top notch in this city and that more jobs are being\ncreated. And that will require many more of the good works that we've seen from citizens and community groups who care about your families.\nBut it's not enough just to fix the water. We've got to fix the culture of neglect, the mindset I was talking about, that has degraded too many schools and too many roads and hurt too many futures. We've got to fix the mindset that only leaves people cynical about our government. Our government is us—of us, by us, for us—the people.\nSo we've got a lot of work to do. But I'm here to tell you I'm prepared to work with you on this. I'm paying attention.\nNow, a couple of specific things I want to address. These aren't in my prepared remarks, but this is what I gathered from the conversations that I had.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]—Detroit—[inaudible].\nThe President. I'm in Flint right now, not Detroit. But I understand. [Applause] But I do love Detroit. And their school needs support, and there is—some of that same mindset has hurt the schools there.\nBut listen up, because this is drawn from the conversations I had with many of your neighbors and friends, as well as the Federal response teams that I sent out here a while back. We're going to do everything we can to accelerate getting new pipes here in Flint. But even with all the money, even with an efficient, speeded-up process, it's going to take a while for all the pipes to be replaced. It's not going to happen next month. It's not going to happen 6 months from now, where all the pipes in Flint are going to be replaced. We've got to get started, and you need to see that it's getting started and that the progress is being made. But it's not going to happen overnight. Even if we get all the plumbers and pipefitters and we get some more apprentices trained—and even if we do all that—it's going to take some time.\nAnd so one of the things I heard talking to a lot of your neighbors is, boy, right now it's rough just trying to figure out how to get bottled water on the way home from work, and you're trying to just shower real quick, and people are still concerned about whether—what's safe and what information is correct and what is not. So I do want to just tell you what I know, based on not just what I've been reading in the papers, but what our top scientists have told me.\nThe first is that while you are waiting to get your pipes replaced, you need to have a filter installed and use that filter. And if you do use that filter, then the water is safe to consume for children over the age of 6 and who are not pregnant.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Now, hold on a second. Don't just start shouting, okay? Because this is the problem—we're going to have to solve this problem. And if people don't listen to each other, then it's not going to get fixed.\nNow, I—so I'm telling you—and I promise you, I'm really good at stirring folks up. So if I want to just come here and stir folks up, I know how to do that. But that's not actually going to solve the problem, all right? So I'm telling what I know, because I guarantee you that the scientists who work for me, if they tell me something—which I'm saying in front of all those cameras—turns out to be wrong, that person will not have a job.\nSo although I understand the fear and concern that people have, and it is entirely legitimate, what the science tells us at this stage is, you should not drink any of the water that is not filtered. But if you get the filter and use it properly, that water can be consumed. That's point number one.\nAnd you can get those filters free, and people will help install them if you need help, particularly seniors who may have trouble going back and forth and trying to get a whole bunch of bottles of water and so forth. So that's information that I trust and I believe. That's point number one.\nPoint number two: Every child in Flint who may have consumed water during the course of this tragedy—and that is the overwhelming majority of children here—should get checked.\nNow, the reason that's important is because lead is a serious issue. And if undiagnosed and not dealt with, it can lead to some long-term problems. But—and this is really important, so I want everybody to pay attention—if you know that your child may have been exposed and you go to a health clinic, a doctor, a provider, and are working with them, then your child will be fine. And the reason I can say that with some confidence is not just based on science, but based on the fact that keep in mind that it wasn't until the eighties where we started banning lead in paint, lead in toys, lead in gasoline. So if you are my age or older or maybe even a little bit younger, you got some lead in your system when you were growing up. You did. I am sure that somewhere, when I was 2 years old, I was taking a chip of paint, tasting it, and I got some lead. Or sometimes, toys were painted with lead, and you were chewing on them.\nNow, I say that not to make light of the situation. We know now what we didn't know then, which is, it can cause problems if children get exposed to lead at elevated levels. But the point is that as long as kids are getting good health care and folks are paying attention and they're getting a good education and they have community support and they're getting some good home training and they are in a community that is loving and nurturing and thriving, these kids will be fine. And I don't want anybody to start thinking that somehow these are—all the kids in Flint are going to have problems for the rest of their lives, because that's not true. That is not true. And I don't want that stigma to be established in the minds of kids.\nI mean, we've learned a lot of things since I was a kid. I used to have adults blowing smoke in my face all the time. [Laughter] We didn't use seat belts. We wrapped dry-cleaning bags around us and thought that was funny. [Laughter] Folks didn't know. No, no, but the reason I think this is important is because I heard from a lot of folks who were saying how moms and dads were feeling guilty. They were feeling sad. They were feeling depressed. Oh, Lord, what's—how is this going to affect my child. And it's right to be angry. But you can't get passive. You can't just suddenly sit back and sink into despair. Our kids will be fine, but you have to now take action. Don't wait for somebody else to reach out and ask whether your child has gotten a checkup recently. We just expanded Medicaid. Go take your child to that doctor. Use that health system.\nAnd so community organizations, churches, et cetera, one of the things that we need to do is—and I've talked to the Governor and the mayor about this—is set up a system of outreach so that we're getting everybody as a village looking out for every child, making sure that they're getting checked up, making sure they've got pediatric care, making sure they're being tested effectively, making sure then that they're getting nutritious food.\nJust to give you an example, we know that if kids are getting vegetables and eating properly, that just by itself is going to have some impact on any effects of lead. But I know that here in Flint, there are whole neighborhoods that don't even have a supermarket. So we're going to have to figure out how to get supermarkets in those communities. And in the meantime, we've got to help make sure that those kids are getting the nutrition they need.\nSo I say all this just to indicate, you should be angry, but channel that anger. You should be hurt, but don't sink into despair. And most of all, do not somehow communicate to our children here in this city that they're going to be saddled with problems with the rest of their lives. Because they will not. They'll do just fine, just like I did fine with a single mom and a lot of you did fine growing up in a tough neighborhood. They'll make it as long as we're there for them and looking after them and doing the right thing for them and giving them the resources that they need. Don't lose hope. [Applause] Don't lose hope.\nI talked longer than I was going to. [Laughter] But I feel strongly about this whole issue with kids now. Kids rise to the expectations we set for them. A lot of kids in Flint already got some crosses they've got to bear. They've already got people telling them, oh, it's too tough for you because you're Black or you're poor or—they will do fine as long as we do right by them. And that's my intention. And set high expectations for them.\nJust a couple more points. What happened here is just an extreme example, an extreme and tragic case of what's happening in a lot of places around the country. We've seen unacceptably high levels of lead in townships along the Jersey Shore and in North Carolina's major cities. We've seen it in the capitals of South Carolina and Mississippi. And even where not long ago, lead-contaminated drinking water was found: right down the street from the United States Capitol.\nSo Flint is just a tip of the iceberg in terms of us reinvesting in our communities. We've seen bridges fall and levies break. So we've got to break that mindset. These things aren't a coincidence. They're the same mindset that left Flint's water unsafe to drink. And it's self-destructive when we don't invest in our communities. Because a lot of times, the people who are against government spending, they'll say, well, the private sector is the key. The private sector is the key for our economy. Free markets and free enterprise are great. But companies won't invest in a place where your infrastructure is crumbling and your roads are broke. You're not going to start a business or be able to recruit outstanding staff if there's no safe drinking water in the city.\nSo my hope is, is that this begins a national conversation about what we need to do in—to invest in future generations. And it's no secret that, on this pipeline of neglect, a lot of times, it's the most poor folks who are left behind. It's working people who are left behind. We see it in communities across the Midwest that haven't recovered since the plants shut down. We see it on inner-city corners where they might be able to drink the water, but they can't find a job. We see it in the rural hills of Appalachia.\nWe've got to break that mindset that says that that neighborhood over there, that's not my problem; those kids over there, they don't look like my kids exactly, so I don't have to worry about them, out of sight, out of mind. We've got to break that attitude that says somehow there's an \"us\" and \"them\" and remind ourselves that there's just one big \"we,\" the American family, and everybody has got to look out for each other. Because the kids here in Flint aren't \"those\" kids, they're \"our\" kids. That's what Scripture teaches us. But I'm not going to start preaching in front of some pastors.\nSo let me just close by saying this. Look, I know this has been a scary time. I know this is disappointing. You've been let down. But there is a sermon about a phoenix rising from these ashes. And there is the opportunity out of this complete screw-up, this painful tragedy, this neglect, this disappointment to actually pull together and make for a better future.\nSometimes, it takes a crisis for everybody to focus their attention. Because there have been a lot of crises going on in Flint; they just weren't as loud and noisy, and nobody noticed. There are a lot of small, quiet crises going on in the lives of people around this country. And this helps lift it up.\nAnd when we see it and we understand it and we feel it, then maybe we start making a connection with each other. And that begins to change our mindset and improve our politics and improve our government to make it more responsive and more accountable. And the good news is, is that that's the natural mindset of our young people. That's why I'm so hopeful about the people of Flint. That's why I'm so hopeful about America generally, is I meet young people all the time, and they've got a mindset just like Little Miss Flint here. She decides, I'm just going right to the President, because I think we can fix this. Or the mindset of Isiah raising $15,000 to help an elementary school where he's never been.\nThat's America. That's who we are at our best. We are a nation of individuals, and we should be proud of everything that we can accomplish on our own through hard work and grit and looking after our own families and making sure we're raising our children right. But we don't do these things alone. Ultimately, our success is dependent on each other. Our success is dependent on each other.\nI have had the privilege of being the President of the United States, a big office, an office that gives me enormous power and enormous responsibility. But the thing I've learned in that job is that I can't do it by myself. I can't fix every problem on my own. I need a mother-in-law who helps Michelle and me raise Malia and Sasha. I need incredible staff who are carrying out our policies to sign people up for health care. I've got to have our incredible men and women in uniform who are willing to go overseas and fight on behalf of our freedom. I've got to have Governors and mayors who are willing to work with me to get things done in their States and in their cities.\nAnd most of all, I need fellow citizens who share the values that built this great country and are willing to work with me and work together to make it better. I've said this before: The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. It's more important than the President, more important than any Senator or Governor or mayor. It is the idea that each of us has something to contribute, each of us has something to give back.\nSo, Flint, I'm here not just to say I've got your back. I'm here not just to say that you will get help. I'm also here to say you've got power. I'm also here to say you count. I'm also here to say that you can make a difference and rebuild this city better than ever. And you'll have a friend and partner in the President of the United States.\nGod bless you.

We reaffirm our ongoing responsibility as citizens and as a nation to live out the admonition: \"Never forget.

The stories of these survivors and their protectors remind us to confront persecution wherever it arises, and that silence can be an accomplice to evil. They remind us of our duty to counter the rising tide of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hatred that threaten the values we hold dear: pluralism, diversity, and the freedoms of religion and expression.\nToday—and every day—we stand in solidarity with the Jewish community both at home and abroad. We stand with those who are leaving the European cities where they have lived for generations because they no longer feel safe, with the members of institutions that have been attacked because of their Jewish affiliations, and with the college students forced to confront swastikas appearing on their campuses. And we call upon all people of good will to be vigilant and vocal against every form of bigotry.\nWhen we recognize our interconnectedness and the fundamental dignity and equality of every human being, we help to build a world that is more accepting, secure, and free.

Sustaining us through great uncertainty and moments of sorrow, prayer allows us an outlet for introspection, and for expressing our hopes, desires, and fears. It offers strength in the face of hardship, and redemption when we falter. Our country was founded on the idea of religious freedom, and we have long upheld the belief that how we pray and whether we pray are matters reserved for an individual's own conscience. On National Day of Prayer, we rededicate ourselves to extending this freedom to all people.\nEvery day, women and men use the wisdom gained from humble prayer to spread kindness and to make our world a better place. Faith communities at home and abroad have helped feed the hungry, heal the sick, and protect innocents from violence. Nurturing communities with love and understanding, their prayer inspires their work, which embodies a timeless notion that has kept humanity going through the ages—that one of our most sacred responsibilities is to give of ourselves in service to others.\nThe threats of poverty, violence, and war around the world are all too real. Our faith and our earnest prayers can be cures for the fear we feel as we confront these realities. Helping us resist despair, paralysis, or cynicism, prayer offers a powerful alternative to pessimism. Through prayer, we often gain the insight to learn from our mistakes, the motivation to always be better, and the courage to stand up for what is right, even when it is not popular.\nEach of us is an author in our collective American story, and in participating in our national discourse to address some of our Nation's greatest challenges, we are reminded of the blessing we have to live in a land where we are able to freely express the beliefs we hold in our hearts. The United States will continue to stand up for those around the world who are subject to fear or violence because of their religion or beliefs. As a Nation free to practice our faith as we choose, we must remember those around the world who are not afforded this freedom, and we must recommit to building a society where all can enjoy this liberty and live their lives in peace and dignity.\nOn this day, may our faiths enable us to sow the seeds of progress in our ever-changing world. Let us resolve to guide our children and grandchildren to embrace freedom for all, to see God in everyone, and to remember that no matter what differences they may have, they, just like we, will always be united by their common humanity.\nThe Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a \"National Day of Prayer.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2016, as National Day of Prayer. I invite the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I join all people of faith in asking for God's continued guidance, mercy, and protection as we seek a more just world.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-04", "title": "Proclamation 9441—National Day of Prayer, 2016"}

And together, as Judy noted, we've accomplished a lot of things.\nAnd one thing that's clear—and you can see it in this room—is the amazing diversity of the AAPI community. From Southeast Asia to the Indian subcontinent, from the Pacific Islands to the Native Hawaiians of my home State, you represent the heritage that spans the globe. And your families may come from different countries. They may speak different languages, practice different faiths. Some of you live on the land of your ancestors. And for others, the journey began when somebody in your family—or maybe you—decided to leave behind what you knew to seek a better life in a new world.\nAudience member. In America!\nThe President. No matter what your background, no matter what your story, whether you're first-generation or fifth-generation American, you're bound by something more powerful than your differences, and that is this unshakeable faith in America, that notion that here, in this country, we can make of our lives what we will. And the AAPI community, you're part of the lifeblood of this Nation. You are our teachers and our faith leaders, our doctors, our caretakers, our artists, our shopkeepers, our police officers and firefighters.\nAudience member. We are citizens.\nThe President. You—this is true. [Laughter] You are our soldiers and our sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen, defending our freedom every day. And increasingly, you are a powerful, visible force in American political life.\nNow, given that success, sometimes, it's easy for people to buy into the myth of \"model minority\" and gloss over the real challenges and discrimination that still exist. We know that certain AAPI groups still face higher dropout rates, obstacles to employment, even higher rates of some diseases. So this is part of the reason why under my administration we're trying to improve the Federal Government's data collection so we get a better picture of which communities might still need additional resources and attention to overcome some of these barriers.\nWe reestablished the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to take a closer look at specific issues facing different AAPI communities. And I want to thank Doua Thor for her amazing leadership. Those efforts have made a difference. And I'll give you a good example. After the BP spill in the Gulf, all recovery information was translated into multiple languages so that we could address the concerns of Vietnamese and Khmer fishermen getting back on their feet after the disaster.\nWhen we passed the Affordable Care Act, 20 million uninsured adults have coverage. Among Asian Americans who aren't yet old enough to qualify for Medicare, the uninsured rate has dropped by more than 60 percent because of what we did, because of Obamacare. And we're going to keep working to make sure everybody gets the coverage they need.\nWe've worked hard to make sure that the AAPI community is represented at every level of the Federal Government. That's why I've made appointments of AAPI judges to the Federal bench. As Judy noted, we've made more AAPI judicial appointments than every other President combined, because we believe that the judiciary has to look like America.\nWe set up a Task Force on New Americans to help immigrants and refugees better integrate into our American communities. And what's been exciting is how many local communities are taking it upon themselves to welcome our newest Americans into the fold and introduce them to both the rights and responsibilities, as well as benefits, of citizenship. Just this week, we finalized a policy to help reunite Filipino World War II vets with their family members who are stuck in our immigration backlog.\nMost Americans understand a fundamental truth about our country: that while almost every nation in the world, to some extent, admits immigrants, there's something unique about America. We don't simply welcome new immigrants, we are born of immigrants. It is our oldest tradition, part of what makes us not only exceptional, but what makes us secure and prosperous and free. Which is why it's so difficult to understand why some folks are still standing in the way of comprehensive immigration reform. We need congressional action. But because we couldn't wait any longer, I took action, within my legal authority, to make our immigration system more fair and more just. And these actions have made this country stronger by welcoming people like Regina Ledesma. Where's Regina? There she is.\nSo I want to tell Regina's story, because it's an example of what's at stake here. Regina came to the United States from the Philippines when she was 5 years old. But when her father, who was an engineer, fell ill, he had to give up his job, which meant he could no longer secure documentation for his family. So Regina's mom supported the family by working at a hair salon. Regina grew up as American as anybody else. She didn't even know until she was in middle school that she was undocumented. And she didn't understand until then that she'd be perpetually in danger of being deported from the only country she had ever called home. As a junior in high school, Regina requested relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—or DACA—policy that we put in place. And today, she's a sophomore studying economics at the University of Maryland. Her future is bright, and America is better off because she is here. That's the story of immigrants in this country.\nSo we're proud of what we've been able to achieve. But in addition to all of you looking very nice, part of the reason we're here is because we understand we can't be complacent. The actions I've taken on my own can't take the place of what we really need, which is Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It's the right thing to do, smart thing to do. And you have the power to push Congress to do it. And you can't give up that power.\nThe AAPI community is the fastest growing minority in America, but it's still—[applause]—well, that's good to cheer about, but it's still significantly underrepresented at the ballot box. In 2012, just 56 percent of eligible AAPI voters were registered to vote. And fewer than half of those registered actually voted. So if you're upset with America's immigration policy, but you're not voting, that has to change.\nAudience member. I'll vote for you!\nThe President. Not for me. [Laughter] We've got some outstanding candidates. If you are upset with Congress, but you're not showing up to vote in midterm elections—not just Presidential elections—that has to change. And if you doubt what's at stake, I think you obviously haven't been reading the papers. [Laughter]\nWe've got to push back against anti-immigrant sentiment in all of its forms, especially by those who are trying to stoke it just to seek political gain and just to try to get headlines. And just as we moved beyond \"No Irish Need Apply\" signs, just as we moved beyond questioning the loyalty of Catholics, just as we moved beyond the active persecution of Chinese immigrants, just as we learned the stain on our history from our treatment of Japanese immigrants and even Japanese Americans in World War II, we are going to move beyond today's anti-immigrant sentiment as well. We will live up to our ideals. We just have to keep speaking out against hatred and bigotry in all of its forms.\nSo I'm proud of all of you for rallying around the Muslim and Sikh and Arab and South Asian communities who face a rising tide of bigotry and harassment. To support your work, we recently launched the AAPI Bullying Prevention Task Force to look at ways that the Federal Government can help your communities prevent and respond to bullying. The Justice Department successfully recommended the addition of \"Anti-Sikh,\" \"Anti-Hindu,\" and \"Anti-Arab/Anti-Middle Eastern\" categories to the FBI's hate crime reporting form. That's going to strengthen our efforts to end these despicable crimes. And we will continue to stand in solidarity with all of our LGBT brothers and sisters against hateful rhetoric and discriminatory State laws targeting them.\nBecause these things are connected. Americans are different. We look different. We sound different. We come from different regions. We have different interests, different politics, different economic situations. But in the eyes of the law, we're supposed to be treated equally. And if one person is being oppressed, if one group feels that justice is being denied, that's an affront to all of us, to the values on which this Nation was founded.\nAnd that's why it's so important that the AAPI community has spoken out in favor of criminal justice reform and sentencing reform. That's a powerful manifestation of this creed that is as old as our founding: \"e pluribus unum\"—out of many, one. That's when this country works. We can be proud of our individual heritage, and we can be fighting every single day for the democratic values and pluralism that allows us to all live together. We can work through the democratic process rather than turn to violence or sectarianism to resolve disputes, as sadly happens in so many places around the world. We can strive to see ourselves in each other. We were all strangers once, until America welcomed us home.\nAnd in the end, this is the work of self-government. It is hard, it is slow. It can be frustrating. Sometimes, it's scary to speak out against wrongs and to help our fellow citizens when they need a hand. That's not always convenient. But ultimately, our job is not just to fight for our own rights, it's to fight for the rights of all people, everywhere. That's our job: to exercise our most precious inheritance, citizenship. And that means we have to be well-informed, we have to engage with our Government, and we have to vote—not when—not just when it's time to elect a President, every single election. School boards matter. County offices matter. State attorneys races matter. State legislative races matter.\nThat's how we honor the trailblazers who sacrificed so that we could be here today and how we fulfill our promise as a nation. That's how we're going to ensure that the freedoms secured by those who came before us will always be the birthright of our children. That's your goal. That's my goal. Now, let's make sure we get to work. Thanks, everybody. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-05-04", "title": "Remarks at the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies Awards Gala Dinner"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117322", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:00 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. We've got a couple of quick comments at the top before we get to your questions.\nAs we've discussed in here many times, America's economy continues to come back strong, creating 14.4 million private sector jobs, over the longest streak of job growth on record -- 73 consecutive months. But too many Americans still aren't sharing in the benefits of that economic progress as much as they should be.\nOne reason for that is that too often large corporations are stifling fair competition and stacking the deck against workers, entrepreneurs and consumers. I want to highlight important pieces of progress today toward addressing these kinds of unfair practices. First, mandatory arbitration clauses and the improper use of what are called non-compete agreements.\nFirst, the independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today put out a new proposal that is designed to crack down on the use of mandatory arbitration clauses. In recent years, many financial products -- from bank accounts to credit cards -- have found a way to avoid accountability by burying mandatory arbitration clauses deep in the fine print of hundreds of millions of contracts. These clauses force consumers to, basically on their own, take on large, well-resourced companies when their rights are violated. Mandatory arbitration clauses deny consumers the ability to join their resources, band together with others who have been harmed and get their day in court. That's just not fair.\nToday's action is yet another example of the important work that's being done every day at the CFPB. You will recall that the CFPB was created by the Wall Street reform legislation that the President aggressively pushed and happily signed into law back in 2010. In addition to writing stronger rules of the road for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans through enforcement actions, the Bureau has put nearly $11 billion -- with a B -- $11 billion back in the pockets of more than 25 million consumers who've been harmed by illegal practices.\nThat's why the President fought so hard to create a strong CFPB, and that's why it's so appalling that Republicans in Congress have proposed to repeal the CFPB in their budget -- while appalling, if not particularly surprising where Republicans get a significant portion of their campaign contributions.\nAlso today, the White House released a report underscoring the need to reform the use of non-compete agreements, which deny workers the ability to leave a company and go work for another company in the same industry -- something that all of you, I assume, might take a little notice of. (Laughter.) Far too often -- just try to --\nQ: There's that.\nMR. EARNEST: I know my audience, Kevin. (Laughter.)\nQ: Yes, you do.\nMR. EARNEST: Far too often, these agreements aren't credibly protecting trade secrets. Instead they're unnecessary roadblocks for workers trying to get a raise, move up by joining another employer, or even start their own company. Nearly one in five workers, including 14 percent of low-wage workers, are subject to them. That holds down their bargaining power and their wages.\nIn the coming months, we will build on examples of states that have taken actions highlighted in the report and put forward options for reform. We'll certainly encourage more states to take action and to make sure employers are treating their employees fairly. The President knows that the best way to make sure everyone shares in our economic success is through healthy competition and stronger protections that guarantee consumers are treated fairly. That's what today's actions to combat both of these unfair practices are all about.\nSo with that, Kathleen, let's go to your questions.\nQ: Okay. I'm going to go back to something you said yesterday, if I could. Your reaction to the elections on Tuesday. You said that you didn't think that the Democratic primary would go to a contested convention, and I just wanted to sort of put a finer point on it, if I could. Does that mean that you think that Hillary is going to win the necessary delegates before the convention? Is that what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I was alluding to is that there's been a lot of analysis that's been conducted about the trajectory of the campaigns, and that was merely a commentary on the reporting out there that's conducted an analysis. I haven't conducted an analysis. The White House hasn't conducted that analysis. I'm just pointing out that most people who've taken a close look at this do not expect there to be a contested Democratic convention.\nQ: So is the White House -- the White House has no opinion on whether or not Bernie Sanders remains in the race?\nMR. EARNEST: As I've said many times, it's the responsibility of individual candidates to make decisions about how to conduct their campaigns. And ultimately, that's what they'll do.\nQ: So if we take Senator Sanders at his word and he's going to stay until the very end, it looks like, at least for the next, maybe six weeks, Hillary Clinton will be hit by Donald Trump on one side and by Senator Sanders on the other. And I'm wondering what the President thinks about that situation. Is that good for the Democratic Party, as he has often said? And if anyone in the White House is interested in trying to mitigate the damage that that might do to her candidacy.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can say is that the President certainly does envision a scenario where he will be strongly advocating for the Democratic nominee for President. And part of the case that he will make will be the importance of Democrats coming together behind our nominee.\nBut the President's interest in this is primarily rooted in his desire to see a successor who is committed to building on the progress that we've made over the last eight years. That progress has been notable, and the President will have a strong case to make when he begins making that case. But we haven't reached the general election yet, but the President will not be shy about making that argument when we do.\nQ: And privately, is anyone in the White House working to talk to the campaigns about how the next six weeks are going to go?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any private conversations to discuss from here today.\nQ: And then I want to turn to the Justice Department letter to officials in North Carolina on the law there. Is it accurate to assume that that's a sign that a lawsuit is coming? It sounds like officials in North Carolina aren't backing down in any way. And was it also meant to send a signal to other states that have passed similar pieces of legislation -- possibly Mississippi?\nMR. EARNEST: The decision to pursue that enforcement action and to notify the state of North Carolina that the Justice Department intended to pursue that enforcement action was a decision that was made at the Justice Department. These kinds of enforcement actions are made independent of any sort of political interference or direction from the White House.\nSo as we have discussed before, the White House as a matter of policy has been in discussions with a number of federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, about what potential impact this law could have on programs that are funded in individual states by the federal government.\nBut when it comes to enforcement actions, those are decisions that are made entirely by attorneys at the Department of Justice.\nQ: So has the White House been updated on this agency review process that you just mentioned? And should we expect similar announcements?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't expect any announcements any time soon -- at least that I'm aware of. But, yes, the White House does continue to coordinate among the agencies that are taking a look at this. And look, the agencies themselves have acknowledged that the passage of this law does raise questions about certain programs that are funded by the federal government through these individual agencies.\nAnd there are a range of legal questions and policy questions that have emerged. They're being carefully considered by individual agencies. The Department of Justice, given the legal questions that are raised, has been involved in that review. And given the need to coordinate the policy questions that have been raised across agencies, the White House has been involved, too. But I'm not aware of any impending decisions.\nAnd all of that, of course, is separate from the enforcement decision that was made by the Department of Justice and announced just yesterday.\nQ: Okay, and then just last one. On the ceasefire in Aleppo, can you give us the White House assessment of how that appears to be holding? And there was some discrepancy about exactly when it started and the need to settle that --\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that this was -- the refreshing of cessation of hostilities in and around Aleppo was slated to take effect yesterday at midnight Damascus time.\nSince then we have seen a reduction in the frequency and intensity of violence in that area of the country. But we do continue to be concerned about some violations, even in that area, that continue. But there are also other places in the country where we have not seen the steadfast commitment to the cessation of hostilities that both the regime and opposition have signed on to.\nSo we continue to make a strong case that all sides benefit from the conscientious implementation of a cessation of hostilities. One obvious benefit is that it creates an opening for international aid workers to provide much needed humanitarian relief to civilians who have been caught in the crossfire.\nAnd I don't know that there has been enough of an opening created in Aleppo thus far to deliver that humanitarian relief. But certainly there is widespread interest in the international community in that taking place. And that certainly is part of what motivates our interest in making the implementation of cessation of hostilities a top priority.\nQ: So is there an effort to extend this one so that these rescue and other -- can get through?\nMR. EARNEST: We certainly are interested in continuing to refresh the cessation of hostilities in those areas where it's started to fray.\nAnd look, the agreement that was reached 36 hours ago did result in -- or I should say the agreement that was implemented 36 hours ago did result in a reduction in violence in and around Aleppo. But there's still too many violations in and around Aleppo and in other parts of the country that are a source of significant concern.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, what's the White House's reaction to the resignation of Turkey's Prime Minister today? And broadly speaking, are you concerned, or is the President concerned that President Erdo?an is becoming too powerful?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, we have seen the news that Prime Minister Davuto?lu is planning to step down later this month. The Prime Minister has been a good partner with the United States, and we have appreciated his leadership.\nObviously, he and the Vice President have been in frequent communication on a range of issues that are important to our two countries.\nI do not anticipate -- just anticipating another line of questioning, I do not anticipate that this is going to have any impact on the ability of the United States and Turkey to work together, to continue to implement our strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL.\nThere are a number of important steps that we have seen the Turks undertake in the last several months that have been important to that effort. We've seen Turkey do a more effective job at shutting down their border with Syria. There's more that we believe that they can do, but they've made important progress that has reduced the flow of foreign fighters to ISIL in Syria.\nTurkey has granted the United States and some of our coalition partners access to air bases in Turkey that have made our military air operations more efficient, and in some cases even more effective. We've also seen Turkey play a constructive role in working with our European allies to address a very difficult immigrant situation.\nAnd even before that agreement with the Europeans, Turkey was bearing a significant burden in terms of providing for the basic humanitarian needs of more than a million Syrians who had fled to Turkey trying to escape violence in their home country. So there is no denying that Turkey has been an important partner and made a valuable contribution to our broader counter-ISIL effort.\nBut as we often do, we regularly remind Turkish authorities to ensure that their actions uphold the universal, democratic values that are enshrined in Turkey's constitution. Those values are not just enshrined in Turkey's constitution, they're enshrined in the United States' Constitution, as well. And these are the kinds of values that we advocate for around the world. And particularly when it comes to questions like freedom of speech and freedom of the press, we've had specific concerns that we have raised with the Turks. We won't hesitate to do so in the future, but it has not affected our ability to work together with our NATO Allies and Turkey to implement a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nQ: Are you concerned -- and that last piece sort of addresses this -- but more specifically, are you concerned that the concentration of power in the office of the presidency in Turkey, specifically President Erdogan, has gone too far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as this point, I wouldn't render a judgment about what potential political impact the Prime Minister's resignation may have. What we're focused on is continuing to effectively cooperate with our Ally to degrade and destroy ISIL. And that's not going to prevent us from raising concerns or, in some cases, even outright objections about the way the government observes the universal and democratic values that are enshrined in their constitution.\nQ: Okay. And then moving south, what is the White House's reaction to the latest development in Brazil, where a Supreme Court justice suspended the Speaker of the House -- or Speaker of the Lower House in Congress, who is one of the main rivals of President Rousseff?\nMR. EARNEST: I was not aware of that latest development. I think what is clear from the coverage that we've seen over the last several months in Brazil, that there is a very challenging political environment that that country's leaders are trying to navigate. And it certainly comes at a difficult time for Brazil, given the economic challenges facing the country and giving the international spotlight on the country during this summer's Olympics.\nBut as the President said in Argentina, six weeks ago, Brazil has a developed democracy. They've got sturdy, democratic institutions that should be able to effectively deal with these challenges and ensure that the concerns that have been raised are properly adjudicated.\nAs with any democracy, that will take some time. There will be some bumps along the road. But the democratic institutions in Brazil are sturdy and should be up to the test of weathering this difficult political situation.\nKenneth.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Once a presidential candidate receives his or her party's nomination, it's tradition for them to receive classified intelligence briefings, as I'm sure you know. So Donald Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories. He has quoted the National Enquirer. He's gone to Twitter to make what some would see as unfiltered statements. So is this White House concerned about Donald Trump getting those classified briefings? And also, is he hesitant to approve that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kenneth, I know that Director Clapper, the Director of the Office of National Intelligence, has spoken to this a little bit already. What Director Clapper has indicated is that the intelligence community typically begins providing those briefings after the party nomination conventions have occurred. And I would expect that that would take place in this instance this year, as well. The decisions about how and whether and when and what to brief to the presidential nominees is something that will be made -- is a decision that will be made by our intelligence professionals. They are committed to fulfilling the spirit of this bipartisan, or even nonpartisan, cooperation when it comes to sensitive national security issues.\nAt the same time, they also will carry out those activities consistent with their understanding about treating this information sensitively. And the President has full confidence in the ability to Director Clapper and the professionals in his office to carry out these responsibilities appropriately.\nQ: But no comment on whether the President would be confident or feel comfortable with Donald Trump getting intelligence briefings?\nMR. EARNEST: Those are assessments that will have to be made by the intelligence community. And the President has full confidence in the ability of our professionals in the intelligence community to make those assessments.\nQ: Josh, on Merrick Garland, now that there are some GOP senators who came out and said, we will not support Donald Trump, is the White House now trying to approach those senators to push Merrick Garland through a little faster, to maybe give him a hearing, maybe get them on your side?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have made the case to all 100 senators that they have a basic responsibility that's dictated by the Constitution whether they're on our side or not. And right now, we've seen too many Republican senators indicate that they're not prepared to do their job, that they're not prepared to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibility. That's a tough position for them to be in, particularly because their explanation is not that they have legitimate, substantive concerns with Chief Judge Merrick Garland. After all, Chief Judge Garland has served for 19 years on the second-highest court in the land. He's got more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.\nAnd just yesterday, the Congressional Research Service issued a report that confirms what you've heard me say many times. The Research Service wrote that, \"Judge Garland has been widely viewed as a meticulous and cautious jurist, writing with his precision and an eye toward ensuring that the Court does not overreach in any particular case.\" It's that approach to doing his job that has prompted even Republican senators to describe Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee. I suspect it's also part of what prompted the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to acknowledge that by not doing their job, Republicans in the Senate were taking \"a gamble.\"\nRepublicans are rolling the dice with the Supreme Court, because they have an opportunity to carefully consider a nominee that the President has put forward that Republicans themselves acknowledge is a consensus nominee; that he has an approach to the law that is entirely consistent with what Democrats and Republicans would like to see in a Supreme Court justice. That's not just my opinion; that actually is the opinion that's articulated by Ted Olson, who was appointed President George W. Bush to represent the United States before the Supreme Court. He's a conservative, he's a lawyer who knows a lot about the Supreme Court, and even he has described Chief Judge Garland as somebody who is exactly what Americans need on the Supreme Court.\nBut ultimately, I don't think the American people are comfortable with Republicans rolling the dice with the Supreme Court. They're not comfortable with this gamble. What they would like Republicans in the Senate to do is simply their job to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibility. As long as they're picking up a paycheck, they might as well do what their constituents sent them to Washington to do. And unfortunately, too many Republicans are saying, well, I'm not going to do what my constituents sent me to do; I'm just going to follow the instructions of the Republican Leader in the United States Senate. That may be their explanation, but I'm not sure it's one that's going to fly with their constituents.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. This morning, the FDA released a rule to regulate more tobacco products, and I'm wondering if the President would veto any bill or rider that would exempt the e-cigarettes from that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the FDA did make an important announcement today. And obviously, while we have made important progress over the last 50 years in reducing smoking rates, the fact is that smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. About one in every five deaths each year can be traced back to tobacco products.\nSo that's why the scientists at the FDA have taken steps to further regulate tobacco products, particularly as it relates to the ability of kids under the age of 18 getting their hands on them. So this is a common-sense proposal carefully considered by the FDA. I know many critics of this rule have suggested that this rule took too long to implement. I actually think it underscores the care and caution and concern that our scientists took in implementing this rule effectively and fairly.\nSo obviously this is something that our scientists believe would have a tangible impact on the basic public health and safety of the American people, particularly America's children.\nSo that's obviously a good thing. I haven't seen any proposed riders. We have made clear -- the President takes a very dim view of attaching ideological riders to appropriations bills. We've certainly indicated our strong opposition to those kinds of proposals in the past. But I'm not aware of anything that's been put together at this point.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple questions on a couple different subjects. One, what is the concern from this White House about the party not coming together like it had in the past around convention time? Because there is a difference in the politics between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And many of Bernie Sanders followers may not be the traditional Democratic supporter.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think I would say that there's concern at this point for a variety of reasons. I think most important of which is that you've heard the President say on many occasions that the differences between the Democratic nominees -- or Democratic candidates are not nearly as significant as the difference between the Democratic candidates and the presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe President has said that on many occasions. And I suspect he'll have many opportunities in the future to make that case.\nBut look, the President's view is that he's going to advocate strongly for a successor who is committed to building on the progress that our country has made under his leadership. And obviously, the President has got a lot personally invested in those policies and in that progress. And he's going to certainly spend a decent portion of the fall here making a strong case that his successor should look to build on that progress.\nQ: Does the White House look at this potential fight leading up to the convention, or this separation still leading up to the convention a problem in relation to fighting against the presumptive nominee who is already the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party? Is this an impediment to possibly gaining ground on Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think -- again, based on what the President has said before I think he feels quite confident that Democrats will come together around a set of values that he himself has been advocating for, for the last seven years.\nThere is a reason that the President is the most popular politician in America, particularly among Democrats, that his approval rating is higher and his unfavorable rating is lower than -- among Democrats than anybody else in the country. That is a strong endorsement of the work that this President has done over the last eight years or so. And that certainly is going to enhance the President's ability to make an argument to those very voters about the stakes in the election, about the need to elect somebody who will look to build on that progress.\nQ: Now -- looking at the next subject, now looking forward to the weekend, Howard University, how does this administration view Howard as it relates to the President speaking this weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, Howard University is one of the finest institutions of higher education in the country. And it certainly is a distinguished institution of higher learning that is -- among HBCUs. And so the President is looking forward to visiting the university and speaking to the graduates.\nIt will be an opportunity for him to discuss the responsibility that the graduates have, not just to the African American community, but to the American people to use their skills and their gifts to form a more perfect union. And there are a variety of ways that those distinguished graduates will be able to do that -- whether that's serving in their community; whether that is serving in our military; or whether that is pursuing a profession and starting a new business; or being part of a remarkable scientific breakthrough that could have consequences for the health of millions of Americans or the convenience of Americans through the use for new technology. So the future is quite bright for those graduates.\nAnd the President will talk about the sense of optimism that he has about their future and the country's future. But he certainly will not skim over the important responsibility that they have, as well.\nQ: So the President is very well aware of the financial troubles that many HBCUs have been undergoing at this time. Is that one of the reasons why he chose Howard? It's the nation's first federally funded HBCU, and it's having some financial problems. Is that one of the reasons why he chose Howard as his last HBCU commencement address as President?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that's why he chose Howard. This is a distinguished class of graduates, and the President has got an important message to deliver to them.\nQ: And when you look back over the eight years and HBCUs, what would you say the President has been able to contribute to the HBCUs, and the HBCU community, which is vast in this nation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the President has had an opportunity on at least a couple of occasions to speak at -- to deliver the commencement address as HBCUs. The President has enjoyed that opportunity in the past, and he certainly is looking forward to Saturday's festivities.\nBut as a policy matter, this administration has worked hard to significantly increase funding for students who attend HBCUs, but also to support HBCUs as institutions. The President believes those institutions have an important role to play in educating future generations of Americans. And this administration has been strongly supportive of it. I can provide you some more details here. I don't have them in front of me. We'll follow up with you.\nMichelle.\nQ: Now that a lot more of the detail has come out surrounding the death of a Navy SEAL in Iraq -- that Special Forces were overwhelmed, that they had to call in more Navy SEALs, that they finally had to leave when they ran out of ammunition; the Peshmerga then had to take over. It's kind of a different line of questioning than -- now that we know those details and just kind of how overwhelmed these guys were, even after they called in their own backups, does that raise concerns for you about the positioning of these Special Forces, given what their role is supposed to be, and how prepared they are? Or in this case, how prepared they weren't for something like this happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I think for the most direct answer to this question, given the operational details that are included in it, I'd encourage you to check with the Department of Defense.\nLet me just say I'm not aware of any policy changes that are prompted as a result of this particular situation and the tragic death that resulted. The individuals -- the servicemembers who were in this situation were highly trained. They were well armed. And they were backed up by overwhelming military airpower that did succeed in exacting many more casualties on ISIL targets -- both fighters and equipment -- than was sustained by American forces to be sure.\nBut there has been a recognition from the beginning that American servicemembers serving our country in Iraq, in an advise-and-assist mission are taking a significant risk. They are putting themselves in harm's way to protect our country. And we owe them a debt of gratitude. And is it at times like these when we're mourning the death of a brave American servicemember that we're reminded in rather vivid terms of their significant sacrifice.\nThat certainly is not lost on the President. And I don't think it's lost on any American who has read the news coverage of this incident over the last couple of days.\nThese individuals are going to great lengths and assuming great personal risk for our freedom and for our safety. They do that so that we don't have to. And we owe them a debt of gratitude. And the Commander-in-Chief certainly does not take lightly the commitment and patriotism of those brave Americans who are serving our country over in Iraq and Syria right now.\nQ: Knowing what happened, does these details bother you?\nMR. EARNEST: What is clear is that it's a dangerous situation. And what's also clear is that these are servicemembers. These are Americans. These are patriots who are well-trained. This is some of the best -- these men and women are some of the best that our country has to offer. And they're preforming a great service to our country.\nQ: I guess the concern is, though, that you could say that this is a fluke situation where nobody really predicated what exactly would happen. Every situation is obviously different. But now that they're in those positions where they are closer to the battle -- okay, this was two miles away. But where they were and what they're doing now, and the fact that more Special Forces are going over there, I feel like this may have been asked before, but I'm sort of asking it now in the context of what happened, that can we expect these kinds of firefights and unpredictable situations to happen more often now that more Americans are over there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would say a couple things about that. The first is that any sort of military conflict like this is going to include a lot of unpredictability. For example, that's precisely why these individuals who are not in a combat mission are equipped for combat, so that if an unpredictable situation arises, they have the equipment and training and resources to defend themselves.\nThe Department of Defense has described the circumstances of the servicemember who was killed. He was actually part of the quick reaction force that was summoned to defend and help expedite the departure of Americans who were advising Peshmerga forces. I think that -- just the circumstances of the situation should illustrate the capabilities of the individuals who are involved. They're tremendous. These are well-trained, well-equipped American servicemembers who are prepared to fight for their country, and to keep us safe, and to keep their fellow servicemembers safe.\nWhat's also true is they have an enormous advantage in terms of being backed up by American military airpower. And there were a number of United States military aircraft that responded to this situation, carried out a series of airstrikes that took some 50 ISIL fighters off the battlefield, destroyed a number of other vehicles, and took out other fighting positions that were maintained by ISIL terrorists.\nSo as tragic as this one particular death is, there were no other casualties that were reported by the Department of Defense. So this is I think a good illustration of just how dangerous the situation is. It's a reminder of how significant a debt of gratitude we owe our servicemembers in Iraq and in Syrian.\nBut it's also a testament to our military planners that even in a situation as unpredictable as this one, the United States and our coalition partners were able to quickly mobilize the resources necessary to respond to a dangerous situation.\nQ: And just before the President went to Flint you were asked here in the briefing and kind of drew some laughs as to whether the President would drink the Flint water.\nAnd you -- just in the words you chose and your tone, you seemed kind of dismissive. And you called that a photo-op. And you didn't know then that the President would take part in that kind of a photo-op. But then he did it three times yesterday. And that seems like the kind of thing that the President doesn't usually like to do, that it really did seem like it was some kind of photo op. Why did the President feel like he wanted to drink the water three times and kind of make this big deal out of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I actually think that, for those of you who were at the pool spray yesterday in the briefing with federal officials, the President spoke for about 15 minutes or so and indicated that he was finished talking and that the pool could move on so we could move on to the next event. And it was actually reporters in the pool who said, Mr. President, will you drink the water? And so he did, acknowledging that he doesn't usually indulge them in these kinds of stunts, but in this case, he did in response to a specific request from a journalist.\nQ: And then he did it two more times. And he called it a stunt, and said it wasn't a stunt, and then he -- calling for the water, and saying, I'm thirsty, and where's the water?\nMR. EARNEST: There typically is a glass of water or tea underneath his podium when he's delivering a speech. It was not there yesterday when he was giving the speech. And I think everybody, again, who was listening carefully noticed that 20 or 30 minutes into his remarks he started coughing and asked for something to drink.\nQ: That wasn't from the water, was it?\nMR. EARNEST: No, this was before the water was provided.\nQ: But it was after the pool spray where he drank the water the first time. Was that what he was coughing from?\nMR. EARNEST: I think he was coughing from having spoken for 20 or 25 minutes in a row without having anything to drink.\nSo I guess what I would say is this. I would acknowledge that the President was indulging the photographers in which he consumed water from Flint after the briefing with federal officials. But at the speech, the man was just thirsty. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, yeah, but he made it a point to say, I don't want a bottle, I want a glass of water -- like somebody bring me a glass of water. And he asked for it twice. And then at the end, he also drank some. So I guess what I'm saying is, if you guys were kind of like calling this a photo-op from the start, why did the President feel it was so important to keep on drinking the water while --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the President was speaking publicly for an hour, and so I think most people get thirsty when they talk for a long time. The President had spoken for a long time and got thirsty.\nQ: The stories that he told saying how he, others had eaten lead when they were kids. He said he felt sure that he had eaten paint chips when he was a kid. Is that true? Is he sure that at some point he had eaten paint chips as a child?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is making the point that the effort to remove lead from gasoline and from paint is a relatively recent phenomenon; that before 1980, it was actually common for even young children to be exposed to lead. And it's only as we've come to understand the impact of that exposure have we taken significant steps to try to prevent that exposure from occurring because it has a negative impact on cognitive and emotional development.\nI think the message that the President was trying to deliver was a critically important one, which is people in Flint have been concerned and were concerned to learn that children in their household, their own children had been exposed to lead through the water supply, and that they had been misled by *federal[state] authorities. And they were scared, they were anxious, and justifiably anger, in the President's own description. But at the same time, the President did not want them to despair about the future opportunities for their kids to succeed. They should feel confident that despite this failure of government, that the children of Flint continue to have a future, and a future that is bound only by the limits of their own imagination.\nAnd that's why it's important for the parents of those kids to understand that even though they were exposed to lead, that's not going to limit the future opportunities of their kids. Yes, they need to get the health care that they need. Yes, they need medical attention. Yes, they should get the proper follow-up. Yes, they should be conscientious about making sure that follow-up occurs, that there are specific things that our medical professionals recommend that can counteract the impact of lead -- of elevated levels of lead in the bloodstream, even for kids. And parents should follow that advice. But they shouldn't further restrain the ambitions of their kids because of this situation.\nAnd I think the President is a good example. The President is making clear that even when the President himself was a kid, he was exposed to lead. And I don't know whether that was from the lead paint in his house when he was growing up, or whether that was from lead that was in gasoline or lead that was in the pipes. The President was exposed to that lead as a kid, and he had a very bright future that allowed him to attend Harvard Law School and be elected President of the United States.\nQ: This is what I'm saying. We're not comparing apples to apples here. Doesn't it seem like an odd comparison that I may have had some environmental exposure to lead as a kid, versus these people who have been drinking lead-tainted water for about a year, and some of these kids had elevated lead levels that are eight times what is considered the minimum level of elevation by the federal government? I mean --\nMR. EARNEST: I guess the President's point is he wasn't even tested for lead when he was a kid, so we don't know exactly what his elevated level was. The point of this is -- but in some ways, that is beside the point. The point here is that being exposed to lead is not going to limit the potential of these kids. The kids in Flint still have an opportunity to succeed. They should get medical attention. That's why we've expanded access to Medicaid. That's why the Department of Health and Human Services announced yesterday a million-dollar grant to health care workers in Flint to expand their capacity to try to meet the needs of these kids. If kids get that medical attention, if they get the follow-up, if they follow the instructions of medical professionals, there is no reason that this government failure should have any impact on their long-term ability to grow up and fulfill their dreams.\nQ: And the President has made the point that government is \"us\" and you can trust government, it's just a bunch of people just like us. But these people for more than a year have been failed by literally every level of government, so why should they put any store in what the President was saying to them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I don't think that's exactly the argument the President was making. The argument the President was making is that too often we find Republicans who denigrate the institution of government without recognizing that government reflects their citizens and that government, as described by Abraham Lincoln -- the first Republican President -- is that government is formed to do the kinds of things that we can't do for ourselves. Nobody should have an expectation that they're going to hire their own police force or hire their own fire department, or hire their own water department. But rather, we're going to work together, we're going to pool our resources, and we're going to be dedicated to the pursuit of the common good. And a tax on government failed to acknowledge that fact, as cleanly articulated by Abraham Lincoln.\nWhat is also true is that when government makes mistakes, as in this instance, we should own up to it, and government should mobilize an effective response to deal with the fallout. And that's exactly what's happened in this situation. But that's not an attempt to downplay the significance of the failures in Flint. It's an attempt to underscore the need to invest in the things that we know are critical to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the American people.\nI used this example yesterday: There's an acknowledgement that environmental regulators at the state level are principally responsible for this failure. That does not mean we should eliminate the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. How exactly is eliminating the role of environmental regulators going to make our water safer or our air cleaner? It's not. It's going to make it worse. What we need is we need effective government, a competent government. And that's what the President spent a lot of the last seven or eight years working on. And I think we've got significant, positive results to enjoy because of that attention.\nDavid.\nQ: On a couple different topics. One, I wanted just to follow up to I think something Kathleen asked about the DOJ letter to North Carolina. Given that you're saying that the White House did not weigh in directly on that letter -- it was sort of a legal decision, a legal matter -- and given the fact that I think the administration has an ongoing review of whether maybe to withhold some federal funding from different agencies to the state based on that law, in the meantime, is the administration or the White House doing anything, taking any direct steps to try to discourage public officials in other states to not pass similar kinds of laws?\nAnd then also, I'm wondering, is there any concern out of the White House, given the DOJ letter, of the issue becoming politicized in North Carolina and having sort of a counterproductive effect of legislators digging in their heels, when you could maybe wait to see if public pressure in the state might have the same effect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, on the second part, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice about their strategy. They were the ones who made the decision to write the letter based on their own interpretation of the law and the need to enforce it. So they can sort of walk you through their thinking when it comes to whether or not that was the right approach.\nMore generally, in terms of other states considering these kinds of laws, I'm not aware of any specific message that's been directed by the White House with regard to discouraging other states from pursuing these kinds of rules. But I think any other state that has observed the economic impact on the state of North Carolina would draw their own conclusions about the wisdom of pursuing laws like this.\nThere are a number of large business interests that have come forward and made clear that this law that makes discrimination against their customers and their employees more likely makes it less it likely that they're going to do business in North Carolina. That's true of athletic organizations like the NBA and the NCAA, but there are other businesses that have come forward and indicated that they're reconsidering expanding their business in North Carolina because of the law.\nSo particularly in an economy where we see states aggressively competing to land business opportunities, there's no denying that passing discriminatory laws like this one is counterproductive.\nQ: On another topic, if I could. On trade -- the President had an op-ed in the Post, promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I'm wondering if -- I know that the administration would like Congress to begin to take this up, maybe pave the way for a vote. Just curious whether you could say whether the administration thinks that having on a vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the lame duck session is legitimate strategy that you would be okay with if it came to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, David, what I can tell you is that we've been in conversations with Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate, and Democrats who have been supportive of our efforts thus far, about the best way to get TPP passed through the Congress. And the political calculation I would acknowledge is complicated. It doesn't fall cleanly along party lines. So we're going to have to work in bipartisan fashion to develop a strategy that will lead to success. And those are conversations that are ongoing with --\nQ: Is the lame duck session a part of the conversation? Is that a legitimate strategy? Does that delegitimize it in any way if a new President has been elected and is coming in and may have qualms about the deal -- does that legitimize it in any way? Or do you feel like it is legitimate as part of your conversations that you're talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to get into the details of the substance of those conversations. I will just stay that there's no reason we need to wait that long, particularly when you consider that ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership would hasten the end to 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods. So American businesses certainly don't want to wait until the end of this year, before Congress acts on the TPP. So it's not just the White House that's making the case that Congress should act on this; it's organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau and the National Organization of Manufacturers who don't typically agree with the White House but are joining us in the effort to encourage prompt congressional action.\nQ: And the final thing on that is just, if the remaining three major candidates in the race total, on each side, have come out as they have with concerns and said they do not support TPP is it currently exists, and they do not necessarily support a vote in the lame duck session, does that make it more difficult, do you think, for the White House to go forward on lame duck with a vote?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, David, I think you have just articulated a political dynamic that should be rather compelling to supporters of TPP wondering whether or not Congress should act this year. Again, supporters of TPP are not likely to have a more enthusiastic President for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017.\nQ: One more. Just following up on April's question about Howard University. The President is giving three addresses to -- or commencements this year, three very different types of universities. One is a sort of historically black college, another is a big state university, and one is a military academy. Is he tailoring his message to each of those? You mentioned -- talking about encouraging the young people to use their skills to form a more perfect union. That's pretty general I think. Could you talk a little bit about if there's a specific message at Howard?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll be prepared to do that tomorrow.\nQ: Okay.\nQ: Why not today? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Christi.\nQ: Josh, thank you. You said a minute ago that the President will spend a decent portion of the fall advocating for the Democratic nominee to succeed him. Can you envision a scenario in which he does that for a specific person prior to the convention?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point I would hesitate to predict exactly what the timeframe will be. But I guess the other thing I would point out is it's -- there are other important races on the ballot other than -- in addition to the presidential race. There are important races for the United States Senate, for the United States Congress, and for some governor's offices where I would expect the President would also be involved.\nAnd we'll sort of see how things play out over the next couple of months. But as we start to make those decisions, we'll let you know.\nQ: Well, as he was speaking yesterday, at one point it really looked -- actually not at one point, but pretty much through the whole address in Flint yesterday, he was making the case for a Democratic Congress and a Democratic White House and a Democratic point of view in general. Could he conceivably continue to do that through July and be as effective as he would be if he were advocating for a particular person?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President was making less of a partisan argument yesterday, and more of a philosophical one. The philosophical argument that he was making is that for our nation and our communities to succeed, we need an effective government. And too often every answer that is put forward by Republicans is one that is focused on tearing down government, or shrinking government, or undermining government.\nAgain tearing down institutions that are responsible for keeping our air clean and our water clean are not going to make it safer for our kids to drink. There are a variety of ways to sort of draw this analogy. It certainly applies to local governments who are responsible for administering elections. It certainly is true when it comes to public safety.\nSo there's a basic question here about what our approach to governing is going to be. And the President believes that Flint actually illustrates those differing -- the consequences of those differing philosophies in rather stark terms. And I don't know if the President is going to make that same argument around the country. But it certainly is an argument that feels pretty resonant in Flint, Michigan right now.\nQ: I think -- I guess my question is if he's worried about the lost time advocating for a particular nominee. But I don't feel like you're going to answer it. So I don't want to waste --\nMR. EARNEST: No. (Laughter.)\nQ: I don't want to hear that speech again. I heard it yesterday. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Fair enough.\nQ: That was a good summary.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not offended. I'm happy to admit the President is better at giving that speech than I am.\nQ: Now if you drink some water right now, that would just be --\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, I'll do that. (Laughter.)\nQ: Can I ask you about something else? The President and his staff lately seem to be doing a lot of explaining, a lot of interviews explaining his record and setting the record straight. Is there a feeling in the White House that some basic things about the President's record in office are misunderstood by the American people?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there is a sense in the White House that it's important for the American people to understand exactly what the President has prioritized over the last seven years. The President entered the White House with a very specific strategy to prevent a second Great Depression, but also to strengthen the middle class. The President entered with a very specific strategy to fight climate change. The President entered with a very specific strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The President entered with a very specific strategy to responsibly get our men and women out of harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President entered with a very specific strategy to ensure that the next generation of Americans would be trained and educated to compete and win in a 21st century global economy. The President entered the White House with a very specific strategy to reduce the deficit, and the deficit has been cut by three-fourths since he took office.\nSo I think just as a factual matter it's important for people to understand that. I think it's particularly important for people to understand, as they consider whether or not they should elect someone who will build on that progress, or scrap it.\nI think it's also important as people evaluate what kind of policies the United States Congress should pursue. Many of the things that I just described were either things that were accomplished as a result of strong Democratic support in Congress, or were accomplished in spite of Republican opposition in Congress.\nSo people understanding exactly what the President's strategy was and what the results have been is relevant as they consider the broader impact of the Obama presidency. And I would actually make the case this is something that we've been talking about for quite a while. And I would anticipate that it will continue over the course of the year.\nQ: Why do you think people -- well, you mentioned the deficit just now. And that's a thing that the President in recent days has said is misunderstood by people. Why do you think people don't know that -- since we're talking about factual things, why people don't know that, haven't registered that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, some of it is certainly that there are Republicans who go to great lengths to lie about the President's record. That happens with some regularity. And there are some Republican interests that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to do that, particularly in the context of the 2012 reelection campaign. So that certainly would be a part of it.\nI think the President has also acknowledged that in the very earliest days of his presidency when there was a raging economic crisis, there wasn't ample time to spend a week or two describing to the American people the steps that the government was taking to address the crisis because the truth is, after implementing a strategy to address one crisis, the President and his team had to move on to addressing the next one.\nSo immediately after -- I think the best example of this is that immediately after passing the Recovery Act, that included billions of dollars in tax cuts for middle-class families, numerous tax cuts for small businesses, and critically important investments in infrastructure and clean energy, the administration also had to figure out how to rescue the American auto industry.\nAnd that was something that was announced at the end of March, just a couple of weeks after the Recovery Act was passed by Congress. So that's an indication of the rapid pace of crisis-driven decisions that this administration had to engage in.\nAnd look, those are two isolated decisions that are still the subject of extensive political debate. But there is no denying the tremendous positive impact that both of those decisions had on our economy. They were unpopular at the time. Some of them are unpopular now. But the results speak for themselves. And so it's important for people to understand the context of those results so that the next time that our country is facing an important economic decision, it's important for the American people to have the facts about what worked so that we can make smart decisions about wise investments in the future.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, at the top of the briefing you said something about the ceasefire in Syria, and a reduction has been noted in terms of the frequency and intensity of the violence. There's been an airstrike in a refugee camp in Syria near the Turkish border that has reportedly killed dozens. There are images all over social media right now. Were you aware of that when you said that you had seen this reduction in violence?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the reduction in violence is specifically around Aleppo, and that is a reduction in violence that we have seen. Yes, I was also notified of this specific report shortly before walking out here.\nThere is no justifiable excuse for carrying out an airstrike against innocent civilians who have already once fled their homes to escape violence. These individuals are in the most desperate situation imaginable. And there is no justification for carrying military action that's targeting them.\nThe other thing that you should confirm with the Department of Defense, but I believe this to be true, there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft that were operating in the region primarily because our efforts are focused on ISIL. And there's little intelligence to substantiate the presence of significant ISIL forces in that region of the country. But obviously reports like this are heartbreaking and indefensible.\nQ: Well, given that Russia has an air force, and the Assad regime has some aircraft, though not a full air force, is it safe to assume that that's who you believe carried out this strike?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't hazard a guess at this point about who carried out this particular strike. We have seen a willingness on the part of the Assad regime to use what military aircraft they have to carry out attacks against innocent civilians. The dropping of barrel bombs is the best example of that.\nAgain, I don't know enough about the details of this particular situation to say whether or not the tactics that were used in this particular strike are the same as the tactics that the Assad regime has used in other parts of the country. But if it does turn out that the Assad regime is responsible for this particular strike it would not at all be the first time that the Assad regime has used its military force against innocent civilians in a desperate situation.\nQ: And to very little consequence, as some would say, particularly when it comes to this ceasefire, cessation of hostilities, that there are no repercussions for these violations, however flagrant they are, that the U.S. just keeps going back to the negotiating table, saying we're dealing with malicious actors but we're hopeful that they're going to show some honor here. Is there any repercussions to a strike like this, killing, as you said, dozens of innocent civilians?\nMR. EARNEST: I think as a result of the behavior that we've seen from the Assad regime thus far, there is no hope that they're going to show much honor. What is true is that the only way to solve this situation effectively, consistent with our national security interests, is for a political transition that results in Assad's departure. And the United States has mobilized the international community, worked closely with the United Nations to try to facilitate those political talks. President Putin has acknowledged himself that that kind of political transition needs to happen. And we continue to impress upon President Putin the need to use his influence with the Assad regime to get them to abide by the ceasefire, the cessation of hostilities, and to participate constructively in the ongoing political talks.\nAnd there was a point where we did see an important reduction in violence as a result of the initial implementation of the cessation of hostilities. That initial implementation went more smoothly than expected, and in the last few weeks we've seen that agreement start to fray. And the improvement in the situation around Aleppo is notable, but as I pointed out, there are other areas of the country where the cessation of hostilities is not implemented in the way that it should. And we're going to continue to work closely with the rest of the international community to impress upon all parties the need to live up to their commitments.\nQ: The White House, the President has talked at great length about how concerned he is about the refugee issue and internally displaced people. Among many of the proposals put forward for some version of a safe zone, some not requiring ground forces, the argument has been to protect against situations exactly like this, hitting people who are already fleeing and in camps. You're still saying the White House does not support any kind of safe zone to protect these situations, these areas, refugee camps near the border of Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, this situation is tragic and there is no downplaying that. But I think it also underscores the difficulty of establishing a safe zone. It certainly underscores the tremendous commitment of military firepower that would be required to enforce a safe zone.\nIn the past, those who advocate a safe zone have suggested that, well, it would not necessarily need to be treated as a no-fly zone. But based on the circumstance that you've just raised, that's not true, and to say nothing of the significant commitment of ground forces that would be required to prevent ISIL or anyone else from infiltrating the camp, to monitor people as they move in and out, and frankly, if necessary, to root out extremist forces that are able to get access to the camp. That is a significant commitment of firepower and manpower. It also puts American troops in a very dangerous place. Lots of them.\nSo our view continues to be that a political transition is the only solution that is consistent with our national security interests in that region of the world.\nQ: Can I ask on North Carolina -- when we were in London, the President said that he thought the law there and in Mississippi wrong and it should be repealed. He went on to say the next day that he lacked the authority essentially to be able to do just that. So lawmakers in North Carolina are saying they feel bullied by this DOJ action. How do you respond to the accusation that this is just another way of achieving the aim of getting that law repealed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what this is, it's an independent enforcement decision that's made by attorneys at the Department of Justice. And there certainly is a legal mechanism for evaluating the concerns that have been raised by the Department of Justice. Hopefully it won't come to that. Hopefully the state of North Carolina and the lawmakers in North Carolina will make some decisions that are consistent with the law, consistent with our values, and consistent with the economic interests of their own state.\nThus far, the actions that they have taken have been inconsistent with all of those things. And the President has spoken out quite forcefully against it because in his view this is something that goes to a core principle of fairness and equality and justice, and treating people the same and not discriminating against them because of who they love or because of who they are.\nSo it's a pretty simple calculation when it comes to values. The Department of Justice has reached their own conclusions about what the law requires, and they've notified the state of North Carolina of their conclusion.\nQ: You said there had been no political interference in the DOJ process. But the President has clearly made his views very public.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the President has been asked by certain insightful, demanding journalists for his view. I'm looking for a way to get -- (laughter.)\nQ: Okay. But again, though, at that town hall the next day. I mean, this is an issue that's drawn a lot of attention.\nMR. EARNEST: I would acknowledge the President has not pulled any punches when it comes to making clear his view that this law is wrong. And that is a value judgment that he is offering, and he believes those values that have been called into question aren't just worth defending, they're worth advocating. And he'll do that.\nBut when it comes to enforcing the law, that's somebody else's responsibility. That's the responsibility of the lawyers at the Department of Justice, and they're carrying out those responsibilities consistent with the requirements of the law and without interference from the White House.\nQ: You're saying there was no influence in the President stating his views and the actions that DOJ took.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess you'd have to talk to the Department of Justice about that. There certainly was no attempt either publicly or privately to influence what is an independent enforcement decision carried out by Department of Justice attorneys.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A U.S. Army intelligence officer based in Kuwait, a captain, has brought a lawsuit, challenging the President's assertions that the war against the Islamic State is legal under existing law. You've been asked a lot about that in this briefing room. Does it give you pause, though, to hear some of these questions come from someone who is deployed in active duty?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it doesn't. I think these are legitimate questions for every American to be asking. The truth is that 449 days ago, the President of the United States sent a detailed ISIL-specific AUMF proposal to Congress. That proposal included a recommendation to Congress that they not just pass this ISIL-specific AUMF but they repeal the 2002 AUMF and take steps to more narrowly tailor the 2001 AUMF.\nThe President feels strongly about this. The day after the election, the President held a news conference with all of you in the East Room of the White House and was blunt about the need for Congress to take action on this. That was the first time that he'd discussed it in really blunt terms publicly, but certainly not the first time that he has advocated in other settings for congressional action on this.\nAnd unfortunately, we've not seen Congress take much action on this. The President sent up senior members of his national security team. His Secretary of State, John Kerry, his then Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel both testified under oath before Congress. But we haven't seen congressional action on one of Congress's most critically important responsibilities. And I'm not really sure why.\nMaybe it's because they were spending a bunch of time considering the President's nominee to the Supreme Court. No, it wasn't that. Maybe it's because they are busy dealing with responding to a public health emergency to make sure our public health professionals they need to respond to the Zika crisis. Well, no, it wasn't that. Maybe it was because Congress was holding intensive meetings with the President's Budget Director to consider the President's budget proposal on a range of important issues, including cybersecurity. No, they didn't do that either. They cancelled those hearings. Maybe it was because Congress was considering how important it was to ensure that the Puerto Rican government had the restructuring authority that they need so they can deal with the financial crisis that's affecting 3 million Americans in Puerto. No, it wasn't that either.\nI don't really know what Congress was doing. But this is yet another example of Congress dropping the ball when it comes to a core American priority.\nQ: And I want to draw your attention to an anecdote in The New York Times, a profile of Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes. You remember, right around the time of the State of the Union, when the Iranians captured a number of American sailors?\nMR. EARNEST: I do remember that.\nQ: Here's what the Times says: \"Rhodes found out about the Iranian action earlier that morning\" -- meaning that State of the Union -- \"but was trying to keep it out of the news until after the President's speech. 'They can't keep a secret for two hours,' Rhodes says with a tone of mild exasperation at the break in message discipline.\" That sounds like he was putting pressure on the military to withhold that information to avoid a political headache. Is that what happened? And how often does it happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to -- well, I'll acknowledge I have not read the story about Ben in the Times magazine. I do remember vividly that day, and I don't think there is any expectation that -- well, let me say it this way, because I think there are a couple of factors here.\nThe first is, Olivier, we've often found that it is easier to resolve situations like this when they aren't subject to intense media scrutiny. We often will decline to discuss specific cases of Americans that are being held hostage around the world because we conclude that discussing them publicly before they are freed is not conducive to their prompt and safe release. I'm sure that was a factor in this situation.\nAt the same time, I think anybody who took a look at the situation recognized that it was not going to stay secret for long, and that that certainly was true in this instance. And I think it is a good example, once again, of President Obama demonstrating his ability to effectively handle a crisis situation. You will recall that despite the pleas of some Republicans in Congress, the President did deliver the speech on time, as planned. And those American servicemembers were released unharmed, with their equipment, the next day. That was an agreement that we had reached with the Iranians.\nSo I think the outcome of this situation and the way that it was handled during that busy day I think is a strong endorsement as any of this President's ability to manage the affairs of the country.\nQ: So you can't say one way or another, though, whether the Times' characterization is accurate -- that it was to avoid an embarrassing piece of news that might overshadow the speech?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I haven't read the piece. I would be surprised if anybody thought that a situation that volatile was going to be secret for that long. I also would say that the way that it is covered publicly has a direct impact on the ability to resolve these situations. And when we're talking about the lives of 10 U.S. servicemembers, their safe return is the top priority, and certainly much more important than any political calculation.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. If I can follow on candidates getting the classified briefings. You said the White House was confident that the intelligence community can make the proper assessments on what presidential candidates receive in terms of classified briefings and information. That seems to leave open the possibility that there are concerns about either one of these candidates and that there are worries about either Trump, or whichever candidate has access to classified information. Is that the impression you meant to leave?\nMR. EARNEST: I meant to leave you with the impression that the decision about what information to provide is a decision that will be made by the intelligence community. That's what I meant to convey.\nQ: The CIA, believe it or not, has a book on the history of presidential candidates getting briefed. True fact. (Laughter.) And there is actually precedent for the White House asking to withhold certain information from candidates. In fact, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger asked that George W. Bush not be given anything sensitive. Can you commit that both candidates will received the same amount of information in this administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can commit to you is that the White House will not be interfering in the decisions that are made by the intelligence community to provide information to the presidential candidates. What information they provide, how often they provide it, whether or not it's the same information for the two candidates -- those are questions that I would direct to Mr. Clapper's office.\nQ: One more on the same topic. The potential Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, is actually under investigation for potential loss or mishandling of classified information. Does the administration have confidence that Secretary Clinton can properly maintain and store and receive classified information, given this ongoing investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, we do.\nQ: Would you say the same about Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, we'll have to see what decision the Director of National Intelligence makes. I guess I can't -- off my own assessment, Secretary Clinton has obviously served this administration with distinction. And she's got a lot of experience in understanding the need to protect classified information.\nBut look, this decision to provide that classified information will be made by the intelligence community. It will be made by the professionals there. And they'll do the right thing for the country, and they'll do that without any political interference from the White House.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. If I could follow up on Michelle's question for just a second.\nMR. EARNEST: She asked a lot of them. I'm not sure which one you may have in mind. Not that there's anything wrong with that.\nQ: Not that there's anything wrong with that. Exactly.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm here to take them all.\nQ: Actually, you know what, let me start off with something simple and we'll sort of back into it. Has the President reached out to the family of Charles Keating IV? And if so, has he made contact with the family thus far?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, Kevin, what the President often will do -- and I think this is what previous Presidents did as well -- is to write letters to the families of those servicemembers who have given their life for their country. And I would anticipate the President will do that in this situation too.\nQ: Thank you. E-cigarettes not for sale for folks under 21. What's the President perspective on that? And what's behind the push?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is actually a decision that was put forward by the FDA. And what they indicated is that, based on their analysis of public health trends, we've made a lot of progress in reducing smoking rates. Smoking rates are now at an all-time low in this country. But we have seen an alarming increase in the use of e-cigarettes and even cigars, particularly by kids. And so the FDA regulation that was announced today is focused on making it harder for kids to get their hands on these products that we know have a very negative impact on their health. And so as an agency that's focused on the public health of the American people, for an agency that has conducted studies that indicate that smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, this is a prudent step that is driven by scientific evidence that's focused on keeping our kids safe. And this is, in that regard, is a carefully considered regulation that I think makes a lot of common sense.\nQ: Does the President believe that the ability to acquire cigarettes should be limited to all Americans who are only 21 and up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think as it relates to this proposal, it's 18 and under. And I'm not aware of the President weighing in on raising the age limit.\nQ: To sort of follow up on what Michelle was asking, can you say with 100 percent certainty that there was no conversation or coordination or collaboration in any way between the White House Counsel's Office and the DOJ as it relates to North Carolina?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is an important thing for you to understand here. We've talked before for a couple of weeks now about how the White House has worked with a range of federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, about the variety of policy questions that have been raised by HB2, this controversial North Carolina law.\nThe policy questions raised are things like what impact that law could have on programs in the state of North Carolina that are funded by the federal government. So this raises questions for everybody from the Department of Transportation, to the Department of Education. And there will be a careful review of what policy impact that law has on policy decisions made at a range of federal agencies.\nWhat the Department of Justice announced today is an intent -- they announced it yesterday -- what the Department of Justice announced is an intent to pursue an enforcement action. Those enforcement decisions are made by Department of Justice attorneys, and they are not subject to influence by the White House.\nQ: Not subject to influence. But if they've had conversations about some of the actions that might be legal, some of the actions that might be relevant in a particular area, can you not see how folks in North Carolina might feel like that's the White House directing -- sorting winking and nod, tap the side of the nose -- saying, hey, listen, DOJ, if you want to pursue this, maybe this is an area that you can pursue? Or if you think of it this way, this is a possible remedy to sort of take a shot at a law that we think is a negative law? Can you understand how people in North Carolina might feel that way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can understand how the people in North Carolina might think that passing this law ended up being a really bad idea. It certainly has not yielded a lot of positive headlines for the state of North Carolina, and it certainly has not yielded a positive economic impact for the state of North Carolina.\nIn fact, concerns about the NBA's decision with regard to the All-Star Game, decisions that could be made by the NCAA about locating college athletic competitions in the state of North Carolina --\nQ: Concerts --\nMR. EARNEST: Concerts. Even other businesses that suspended their intent to expand their footprint in North Carolina. All of that is going to have a negative impact on the economy in North Carolina. So I think that's the biggest impact. And I think that is probably the concern that the vast majority of North Carolinians have about the bad decision that the legislature and the governor made to pass and sign this law.\nQ: So you reject the notion that this is some sort of a government overreach, the Feds coming in and telling us how to --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are some people who have a pretty persuasive case that this is a government overreach on the part of state officials in North Carolina that's had a negative impact on the public perception of their state and on the economic climate in their state.\nThis is unfortunate because the state of North Carolina is a state that has traditionally -- certainly over the last generation or two -- worked really hard to diversify their economy; and that there are young adults -- not just across the South but across the country that have been attracted to the state of North Carolina because of their positive business climate, business you have a hub of innovation there, like the Research Triangle, that has drawn young, educated people and their families to come and pursues some interesting economic opportunities in that state.\nAnd that is a testament to the innovation and ingenuity of the people of North Carolina and to previous governors and previous state legislators. Unfortunately, it's this current governor and the current legislator that have dealt a pretty big setback here. And it is something that -- it is not true to the culture and values and beliefs of the vast majority of Americans who live in that great state.\nQ: Just a couple more. I want to ask you about AUMF if you have a second. Has the President -- maybe by way of the Counsel's Office -- given the ongoing actions in Iraq, opened the door for future Presidents to be able to wage war in perpetuity based on the way that currently this Counsel's Office is interpreting the AUMF as it stands? Has this now made it possible for future Presidents to point to this President and say, well, if Congress doesn't act and give me a new AUMF, I can continue to use this footprint, or this blueprint to continue to wage actions around the globe?\nMR. EARNEST: The fact of the matter is, Kevin, the 2001 AUMF didn't have a time limit on it. And one of the things that we have discussed with Congress is how and whether to force Congress to review at some regular interval an authorization to use military force that they previously passed.\nThere have been some proposals that have been put forward, including by some members of Congress, that have suggested that an authorization to use military force should have to be renewed by Congress every three years, otherwise it goes away. It sunsets.\nSo there are a variety of creative legislative proposals on this. But look, the fact of the matter is the 2001 AUMF that was passed by Congress didn't include a time limit. It just didn't. So that is precisely why -- or that's among the reasons why the President believes that the 2001 AUMF should be more narrowly targeted. And that's what our proposal included an ISIL-specific authorization to use military force. We've put forward legislative language describing what we believe that should be.\nThat was the source of some criticism by Democrats and Republicans in Congress. And we said, fine, negotiate with us. Tell us what else you'd like to see in there. And we haven't seen much action on that. We also proposed eliminating the 2002 AUMF that allowed President Bush to order the invasion of Iraq. And we suggested that Congress take action to more narrowly tailor to the 2001 AUMF.\nI think all of that is a pretty clear indication that this President of the United States is quite eager for Congress to actually step up to the plate and fulfill one of the most basic functions that they have. But this Congress has unfortunately abdicated that responsibility in the same way they've abdicated their responsibility to address other urgent needs of the American people like the situation in Puerto Rico, or the situation with respect to the Zika virus, or even filling a vacancy in the Supreme Court.\nQ: Last one and this is your favorite topic, Donald Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: So many favorite topics. (Laughter.)\nQ: The Intercept and The Washington Post over the last couple of days have put out a number of different quotes from pundits who dismissed completely or outright the ascendency of Donald Trump. And yet he continues to rise. He's now on the verge of capturing the GOP nomination. And I'm just wondering, as you look at that, what does that say about the mood of the country? And does the President view that with amusement? Or does he view that through the prism of it speaks to a frustration and he's not surprised by the ascendency of a Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I think mostly what it tells me is that I don't get paid enough to be a pundit, so that's why I try to avoid doing that from here. (Laughter.)\nSo with respect to the President's view, I think the President has had on a number of occasions the opportunity to discuss this, primarily when asked by one of you.\nQ: But so many missed it so badly. Even Nate Silver missed this.\nMR. EARNEST: But there -- again --\nQ: That's amazing.\nMR. EARNEST: That's why I've gone to great lengths to avoid playing pundit up here. I also suspect that there will be a robust market for books about the 2016 election chronicling this phenomenon. So I think one of the reasons that it's interesting is that there are no clear obvious answers to exactly what's happening. But that will only be one other factor will combine with several others to make for a rather interesting fall 2016.\nQ: But it must say something about the mood of the country, no?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has talked about this. The President has talked about how justified people are in being frustrated that all of the benefits of the tremendous economic recovery that we've made since the Great Recession have not been enjoyed evenly across the country; that too many of those benefits flow to those at the top. And that exacerbation of an already yawning gap, wealth gap, is something that a lot of Americans are justifiably frustrated by.\nAnd the President sought to take this head on. That's why the President advocated for raising the minimum wage and making permanent tax cuts for middle-class families, and raising taxes for those at the top, and closing tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected. Unfortunately, Republicans have blocked those attempts time and time again. Some of them we actually achieved over Republican obstruction -- raising taxes on the top 1 percent, for example. But look, this is something that I anticipate will be the subject of ongoing debate leading up to the next election as well.\nJared, go ahead.\nQ: Two of your favorite topics wrapped up into one question -- classified presidential directives and also press access. For the DNC and RNC in July, the United States Secret Service is justifying a drastic change on convention background checks on a 2013 still classified national security directive from President Obama. Is the President aware of the extent of the changes that the DNC and RNC will undergo because of his directive? And is he concerned by that?\nMR. EARNEST: Jared, I feel confident in telling you the President is not aware of the press access plans for either the Democratic or Republican conventions that are planned for July. So I have to admit that I know very little about them as well.\nQ: This was a directive signed by the President in 2013. It is classified, it's Presidential Directive 22 -- PPD 22 -- and it's something that is going to require for the first time -- the President's conventions where he was nominated as the Democratic candidate in 2008 and 2012 did not have Secret Service background checks the way we will now have in 2016. So not as something he should be aware of except maybe as the person who swore to protect the First Amendment rights of everybody in the country. Is that something that he's concerned about? These changes are drastic.\nMR. EARNEST: Jared, I don't know that they are. The pass you're wearing around your neck right now required you to submit to a background check conducted by the Secret Service.\nQ: Sure, but there are no delegates in this room who didn't have to go through a background check.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Everybody that's -- actually everyone that's in this room did have to go through a background check in order to enter this building and stand here right now. That's a fact. That's true of me and my staff, and that's true of all the journalists here, too. So, again, I don't know that much about the details, but I suspect that the Secret Service can do a better job of helping you understand exactly what security precautions they're taking to ensure the safety of everybody who participates in the conventions this summer.\nQ: Can you take the question? Because I feel like there's more. And I know that this is a classified directive, but I feel like there --\nMR. EARNEST: I think you should take the question to the Secret Service if you have questions about why you need to undergo a background check in order to attend the convention. I think most reasonable people would acknowledge that that kind of safety is required for everybody's protection.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, can you say whether President Obama has given up on the idea of making any recess appointments?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I can't speak to that. I don't know of any that are planned at this point.\nQ: Is he stopped by considering them by when the Senate -- like this week, when they're out, they hold pro forma sessions a couple of times during the week to keep him from making a recess appointment -- even though you might say they're on recess, but they say they're not because they have the pro forma sessions that last about 30 seconds.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think even many of them will talk rather freely about the fact that they're on recess. But, look, the Supreme Court has weighed on this just recently in the last year or two. So I think this is largely a settled matter.\nQ: In what way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in that the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to weigh in on at least part of this question.\nQ: So does he think he is unable to make recess appointments because of the Senate sessions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is limited, but again, I'm not an attorney and I haven't gotten the legal briefing on this. But I don't know that that's necessarily been eliminated.\nQ: None in the pipeline, you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: You're saying there are none in the pipeline?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. Not that I'm aware of.\nJohn in the back, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on TPP and the ongoing discussions with congressional leaders. Can you say if those talks now include Senator McConnell?\nMR. EARNEST: Senator McConnell is somebody that has, in the past, talked about how important the Trans-Pacific Partnership is for our country. And he is somebody who did work effectively with the administration to pass Trade Promotion Authority last year, and we certainly would need to work closely with Leader McConnell to succeed in passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year as well.\nIt's not just the administration that's making this case. Our friends at the Chamber of Commerce just across the street here I'm sure are in regular touch with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. The same is true of the American Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers.\nQ: And House Republicans are proposing for war funding to expire next April. Given the fact that President Obama would be out of office, would he veto, say, an omnibus or any legislation, even a defense authorization bill, that came over with that plan? Or does he -- would he feel the next President, the next Commander-in-Chief should negotiate the war funding?\nMR. EARNEST: John, I'd actually refer you to Secretary Carter's comments on this. President Obama believes that funding our war effort a few months at a time is grossly irresponsible and not the way that we should be demonstrating our clear commitment to our men and women in uniform who are risking so much to protect our country. Again, Congress's responsibility here to provide for the basics when it comes to ensuring that our men and women have the resources that they need to go and degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is critically important. And Secretary Carter had some very uncharacteristically direct language about this, and it's fair for you to assume that the views that he expressed are consistent with the views of the Commander-in-Chief.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:38 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117513", "text": "INSKEEP: How is West Virginia different, if at all, from anywhere else you campaigned?\nSANDERS: Well, West Virginia has some pockets of the worst poverty in the United States of America.\nWe're going to McDowell County. And the reason we're going there is that about half the people in that area are living in poverty — and that what is really astounding is that the life expectancy of people in that community is extraordinary low.\nYou know when we talk about poverty, Steve, we often think, well, it's too bad somebody can't afford a flat-screen TV, or go out to eat. But what poverty is really about is that we have millions of people who are living — who are dying at ages much, much younger than they should. In McDowell County, where we're going tomorrow, the average life expectancy for men in that county is 64 years of age. Sixty-four years of age.\nAnd yet you go a six-hour drive to Fairfax County, Va. — six-hour drive — a man can expect to live until the age of 82 years of age, 18 years longer than men in McDowell County...\nINSKEEP: These are really compelling statistics, Senator. And you mention McDowell County — I believe the poverty rate there is something like 35 percent, and of course...\nSANDERS: ... I think it's even higher than that actually.\nINSKEEP: ... a lot of people are certainly close to that. But there's another statistic that's on my mind, along with the poverty stats, and the life expectancy — shocking life-expectancy stats.\nYou're going to a couple of counties — McDowell County, W.Va., is one of them — that voted for Barack Obama in 2008, and then voted against him, for Mitt Romney, in 2012. What has been happening to the Democratic Party in the region where you're going?\nSANDERS: Well, that's an excellent question, and I think it goes well beyond McDowell County and well beyond West Virginia. And I think there are many people around this country — poor people, working people — who believe that the Democratic Party is not effectively standing up to them.\nNow, if I lived in McDowell County and the unemployment rate was sky-high, and I saw my kid get addicted to opiates and go to jail, there were no jobs, you know what? I would be looking at Washington and saying \"what are you guys doing for me?\" And I'm going to look for an alternative.\nI think one of the challenges we face, what my campaign is about, is making it clear that the Democratic Party must be on the side of working people and low-income people. Now I'm talking about poverty, and in this campaign I'm talking about the fact that we have the highest rate childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That we have 47 million people living in poverty ... that we have 29 million people who have no health insurance, and we have thousands of people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time.\nThe Democratic Party must make a stand, and the stand is that you cannot be on the side of Wall Street. You cannot be on the side of that pharmaceutical industry — which, by the way, charges our people the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs — you gotta make a stand. And the stand we gotta make is the stand with the people in McDowell County, W.Va., and poor people and working people all over this country.\nINSKEEP: It's interesting — when you travel in that region, as we did just a few weeks ago, for Morning Edition here — you're in coal country, you hear people bring up Hillary Clinton in a specific way. She was criticized for saying that \"we're going to make coal jobs go away,\" even though she was going on to say, \"and we want to help people who lose their jobs.\" But she was criticized for that one part of the statement. Would you be any better from the perspective...\nSANDERS: Yeah I would...\nINSKEEP: ... of people in Appalachia who are concerned about that history?\nSANDERS: Look, I have spent my whole life fighting for working people. I have a 98 percent voting record with the AFL-CIO. I have opposed disastrous trade agreements — and I think there is perhaps no candidate in the United States Senate who has a more progressive record than I do.\nBut I also believe, and understand, as a member of the Senate Environmental Committee, that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is already causing severe problems in our country and around the world. And we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\nNow, I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation ever introduced in the U.S. Senate. And in that legislation — because we understand it is not the fault of the coal miners, or people included in the fossil fuel industry, they have a right to want to feed their families, and live in dignity — we have $41 billion in that legislation to make sure that those workers who might be displaced as a result of the transition away from fossil fuel get the extended unemployment benefits they need, get the education they need, get the job training that they need. And also we are going to invest heavily in those communities.\nINSKEEP: How do you speak to people in a community like that, who have deeply mixed feelings about government? You may run into the same person who says \"I'm on Medicaid, I get various kinds of assistance, but I really don't like it. I don't like living like this, I don't like depending on government.\"\nSANDERS: Well, I think it raises a fundamental issue about politics in America today and who we are as a civilized society. I understand that the right-wing has done a very good job in suggesting that \"freedom\" — and this is the Koch brothers' line — \"freedom\" is about ending social security ,and Medicare and Medicaid, and actually abolishing the concept on the minimum wage. So Steve, you can be a free guy and work for $4 an hour — aren't you a lucky guy?\nBut you know what, most Americans don't believe that, and one of the things I'm really proud of in this campaign is that in election after election — in primary and caucus after caucus, right here in Indiana where we won last night two-thirds of the people 45 years of age or younger. ... And the reason I think is they understand that in a democratic, civilized society, government has a very important role to play.\nAnd the word has gotta get out — it doesn't get out all that often in the media — that the United States is the only major country on Earth, for example, that doesn't guarantee health care for all people. Life would be a lot different in McDowell County if all of the people there, and all of the people in Vermont, and all of the people in Connecticut, had health care as a right, which is the case 50 miles north of where I live, in Canada, for example.\nINSKEEP: What do you say then, to people who just say — \"regardless of my own situation, it bothers me that government has to do so much for people, or is doing so much\"?\nSANDERS: I think that that is mythology that has been effectively perpetrated by the big-money interests in this country. To say that every other country in the world guarantees health care to all of their people, every other country has paid medical and family leave, a number of countries provide free tuition in public colleges and universities, most countries take care of their elderly and their children a lot better than we do...\nI think what you have seen in the last many years in this country is a very coordinated effort of the part of corporate media, and the wealthiest people in this country, to perpetuate an ideology, which says that government is terrible, government is awful — oh by the way, except when we can get some corporate welfare.\nI point out in all of my speeches, Steve, that Walmart — which is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in this country, worth some $149 billion — they get a huge subsidy from the taxpayers of this country, from you, from me, from every working people, person, because the wages they pay their employees are so low that many of those workers have to go on Medicaid or food stamps in order to survive. I don't think the middle class of this country should be subsidizing the wealthiest family in the United States of America.\nSo I guess if it's OK for the Walton family to get billions of dollars of support from the taxpayers of this country, maybe its OK for working families to get health care and paid family medical leave.\nINSKEEP: Senator, I put a call out on Twitter — I said \"I'm talking to Bernie Sanders, you got anything you want to know\" —and the most consistent theme in the many responses we got had to do with how long you're going to stay in this race. Even though you just won Indiana, people are looking at the delegate counts, recognizing that you've got long odds, and wondering if you're going to stay in too long.\nSANDERS: Well we're going to stay in till the last vote is counted, and that will be in the primary in Washington, D.C.\nINSKEEP: June 14.\nSANDERS: That's right. We think that ... I don't know, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think that the people of every state in this country — including the largest state in America, California — should have a right to cast their votes as to who they want to see as president of the United States, and what kind of agenda they want the Democratic Party to have.\nWe won last night in Indiana — that is our 18th state. We're going to fight in West Virginia — I think we've got a shot to win there. We've got a good shot to win in Oregon, and I think we've got a good shot to win in California and some other states, so we are in this race till the last vote is cast.\nINSKEEP: Let me ask a couple of specific questions — just people on Twitter — here's one. Are you threatening your revolution by continuing, and alienating some Democrats from voting for Hillary Clinton eventually?\nSANDERS: Well I think we are perpetuating the political revolution by significantly increasing the level of political activity that we're seeing in this country. Millions of people are now coming into the political process as the result of what our campaign is about. I think it is good for the Unites States of America, good for the Democratic Party, to have a vigorous debate, to engage people in the political process.\nYou know, two years ago in 2014, 63 percent of the American people didn't even bother to vote, and 80 percent of young people and 80 percent low-income people didn't bother to vote in the midterm elections — I think that that is pretty pathetic. And I think that Democrats do well when the voter turnout is high. Republicans lose when the voter turnout is high.So I'm going to do everything I can to stimulate political discourse in this country — get young people, working people involved in the political process.\nWe think we have a path towards victory — admittedly it is a narrow path, but when I started this campaign we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton; yesterday here in early May we won in Indiana. I think we've got some more good victories coming — so we are in this race until the very last vote is cast.\nINSKEEP: Another variation on this question from Twitter: Which is more important, a Sanders presidency or a Democratic presidency?\nSANDERS: Well, I think that if you look at the issues facing this country, and the differences between Secretary Clinton and myself, I think, a) my policies and my agenda will be better for the working families of this country, and second of all, if you look at virtually every poll that's out there — including one from CNN today — Bernie Sanders does better against Donald Trump than does Hillary Clinton. So if we want to make sure that we do not have a Donald Trump in the White House, I think that at this point Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate.\nINSKEEP: Do you mean a Sanders presidency is more important than this person's suggestion that a Democratic presidency might be more important?\nSANDERS: Well, what I'm just suggesting is — if you look at every poll that's out there — Bernie Sanders does better against Donald Trump, more likely to defeat Donald Trump, than Hillary Clinton.\nINSKEEP: One more question along those lines, and this is my question now — you told Chuck Todd of NBC the other day that if Secretary Clinton does clinch the nomination quote \"the responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton, to convince all people,\" not just your supporters, \"that she is the kind of president this country needs.\" Are you convinced, Senator?\nSANDERS: Well I thought my point was, that it's true of Secretary Clinton, it's true of Bernie Sanders, it is true of Donald Trump — you want to go out and win elections, you've got to convince the people of this country that you are the candidate that works best for their interests. And I think there's a lot of work that has to be done on the part of all of the candidates.\nINSKEEP: The reason I ask is because you did say earlier in the campaign she was not qualified. Can you convince yourself, or have you convinced yourself, that she is qualified?\nSANDERS: Right now — as I have said many times, Steve — I think that a Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster for this country. And I intend to do everything that I can to see that that does not happen.\nINSKEEP: Does that mean to say that you would be out this fall if you don't win the nomination, campaigning?\nSANDERS: You know, as I just said Steve, I think that a Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster for this country.\nI am the most progressive member of the Unites States Senate, I think. I have fought as hard as I can for working people, and I'm not going to see a president come into office like a Donald Trump, who is busy dividing us up in terms of picking on Mexicans, and Latinos, and Muslims, and women, and veterans, and African-Americans. That is not the type of president that we need, and that is not the type of president that I — I will do everything in my power to make sure that he does not become our president,\nSo, Steve, so — thank you so much...\nINSKEEP: Senator? Do you mind if I ask one more question?\nSANDERS: One last question. Sure, we got time for one more.\nINSKEEP: Yeah just, talk me through — because you said you have tough path, but one that you can walk — I'm just interested about a little bit of the mechanics here.\nYou'd have to win a lot of delegates — a great majority of delegates along the way to get a majority of pledged delegates. There are some big states ahead — it's certainly true — but just the way delegates are awarded, even if you win California, even if you win West Virginia, you don't get all of the delegates. They're not winner-take-all. Doesn't that make this extraordinarily difficult for you to...\nSANDERS: Yes, it's an uphill battle. But you know what? Steve, when I started this campaign, it was an extraordinarily uphill battle — we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton. Polls out there in the last few weeks, a few had us ahead actually in national polls, or a few points behind. The path to victory is to do extremely well in the remaining states — and as you indicate, California, of course, is the largest state. And we hope to do well there, and win that state.\nINSKEEP: Could — and is...\nSANDERS: But here is the other path, Steve — you asked me a question, let me give you an answer here — is that we have won a number of states, in Washington and New Hampshire, by landslide victories, and I'm talking about 65, 70, 75 percent of the vote. I think it is incumbent on the superdelegates—\nThe problem, one of the main problems that we have, is that the establishment Democrats, of course, supporting all of — virtually all of them are supporting Hillary Clinton. I think that in those states where we have won landslide victories, those delegates should reflect the wishes of the people of their state and give us their votes.\nAnd then I think we have got to make the case to the superdelegates, who in many cases, were on board for Hillary Clinton even before I got into the race, that they should take a hard look at which candidate is stronger against Donald Trump. And I think we can make that case.\nINSKEEP: Let me follow up on that...\nSANDERS: Steve I apologize — one more question, because I've gotta run here.\nINSKEEP: Is there a real danger that Donald Trump — now that he's the presumptive Republican nominee — that he's the kind of different candidate who might seriously appeal to the very kinds of voters that you've been appealing to all this time, that you want to bring back to the Democratic Party?\nSANDERS: Is that a serious — you mean...\nINSKEEP: A real danger of that, yeah, in the fall?\nSANDERS: You say a risk? Well, you know as I said a moment ago — what campaigns are about is going out and making a case to the American people. Does Donald Trump have support in this country? Of course he has support — he has won the Republican nomination, so of course he has a lot of support. He has won it overwhelmingly in state after state after state.\nINSKEEP: Can he drag Democrats over to the Republican side?\nSANDERS: Well the question, I think that's the wrong question, Steve. The question is, why is somebody with Donald Trump's perspective appealing to Democrats?\nThat gets back to the question we talked about at the beginning of this conversation. Has the Democratic Party, has the leadership made the case that they are standing there, fighting for the poor people of McDowell County, or the working people of Indiana, or of New Mexico, or of California? Have they stood up and said that \"maybe we gotta take on the billionaire class, maybe it's wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, maybe we should not be getting significant sums of money from Wall Street or from the pharmaceutical industry that charge us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\" you know, \"maybe we've gotta stand with the people who for the last 20 or 30 years have seen a decline in their standard of living\"?\nYou know, those are the issues that the Democratic Party has got to ask itself. And I think when it does, and it makes it clear that they are prepared to take on the big-money interests, I think the Democratic Party will do just fine — and that's kind of what this campaign is about.\nINSKEEP: Sen. Sanders, thanks very much\nSANDERS: Thank you very much Steve. Take care.", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio"}

Bernie Sanders on Thursday came to McDowell County, West Virginia, for a meeting with people from nearby towns and hollows who gathered at a food bank in one of the worst pockets of poverty in the United States.\n\"What is strange about what goes on in America is that we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world,\" Sanders told more than 250 people at the Five Loaves & Two Fishes Food Bank.\nHe pointed to mounting wealth and income inequality nationwide. In West Virginia, while the top 1 percent saw incomes rise more than 60 percent from 1979 to 2012, incomes for everyone else fell by 0.4 percent. He also said 22 percent of American children live in poverty, including about 100,000 in West Virginia.\n\"What poverty is about is dealing with the stress of whether or not your family is going to make it every single week,\" Sanders said. \"When you don't have any money you're fighting for your survival every single day.\"\nThe senator also cited studies showing how poverty cuts lives short. Here in McDowell County, where suicides and drug overdoses are leading causes of death, men live to be only 64 on average. Women typically live to be 73. That's a sharp contrast to Fairfax County, Virginia, only a six-hour car ride away, where the average lifespan for a man is 82 and a woman is 85.\nSanders has outlined an agenda to address poverty in America. He would expand Medicare to cover all Americans, raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, ensure pay equity for women and make public colleges and universities tuition free.\nHe also called for a major investment in rebuilding roads and bridges to create jobs. More than 1,500 bridges in West Virginia, 22 percent, are functionally obsolete. Sanders would invest $1 trillion in rebuilding roads and bridges. Paid for by closing tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes, Sanders' legislation would create at least 13 million jobs.\nHe also said job-killing trade policies have thrown West Virginia workers out of their jobs. Since passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China, West Virginia has lost more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs. Sanders has also introduced a $41 billion plan to transition coal workers into new industries that pay a living wage and to rebuild communities that have been dependent on the fossil fuel industry.", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Press Release - Poverty in America"}

Sanders will focus on how poverty can be a death sentence. In McDowell County, where deaths by suicide and from drug overdoses are among the highest in the state, men live on average to be only 64 years old.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120897", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Thank you all. (Applause.) Thanks so much. You all rest yourselves. (Laughter.) You've been working hard and, obviously, after this announcement, you'll have a lot more work to do once you're rested. Welcome, welcome.\nWe are so thrilled to have you all here at the White House today. Let me start by thanking Kathleen for that just very sweet introduction. She didn't share with me backstage the story about Sophia, so it's like, you're going to wait and make me cry -- (laughter) -- right before I came out. (Laughter.)\nBut the reason why we like to have folks like Kathleen share their stories is that they are the best representatives of why Joining Forces means so much to me and Jill. When we talk about being in awe of these men and women, it's stories like Kathleen's and her family's, and there are millions of people like her out there. So I want to thank Kathleen and her amazing family for being my inspiration. Thank you all for your service and sacrifice. We're so grateful and we love you all. We love you to death.\nI also, of course, want to thank Jill, my dear, dear friend, who has been an amazing partner in this Joining Forces endeavor. But more importantly, she's been a terrific friend to have over this interesting journey that we've had together. So we made it to five years on Joining Forces. Looking back, we started talking about this backstage when Barack chose Joe to be his vice presidential candidate, and we both talked about the passion we had developed for our military -- her as a Blue Star mom and me as a regular civilian who didn't have that connection. So to be able to celebrate this milestone together with you today means the world. So thank you, Jill. Thank you so much. (Applause.)\nAnd, of course, I have to recognize our dear friend, Jeff, an Amazonian -- I like that -- (laughter) -- and all the Amazon team. Thank you, Jeff, for your leadership, for making such an extraordinary commitment to our veterans and our military spouses today. You are setting the bar high, you are doing a phenomenal job. Your team is amazing, and you were smart enough to hire Kathleen, so you must know what you're doing. (Laughter.) Thank you so much, Jeff, from Amazon, as well. (Applause.)\nNow, I'm going to take just a moment on this fifth anniversary to embarrass a couple of people. I want to give a special -- and they're both looking down now. (Laughter.) They're like, oh, no, oh, no. First, I want to thank Andy Anderson. Andy, please stand up. I'm sorry, you've got to stand up. (Applause.) Andy is an Airforce Major and an actual rocket scientist. (Laughter.) There's one right there. We always touch him and go, ah -- and we didn't know they were that cute, too, rocket scientists. (Laughter.) But he has been serving on our team as a White House Fellow, and Andy has done such outstanding work on not just this event but on so many others. I don't think people realize that all the work out of Joining Forces comes from a handful of people on Jill's and my staff. And Andy is one of those folks, and it's just been a pleasure to have you and your family on our team.\nThe second person I'm going to embarrass is sitting right next to him. (Laughter.) Our Joining Forces Executive Director, Colonel Nicole Malachowski, whose last day with us is tomorrow. So Nicole was the first female Thunderbird pilot. She has flown 200 combat hours and received every award and recognition you can imagine. And she is as humble -- she is the total opposite of all that. (Laughter.) I have to pull her up and get her to talk. And she's a great mom, and I just have loved having you on our team. And our executive directors come and go -- we only get them for a year, and Nicole is leaving us, but I love you. You have done a phenomenal job, and I wish you all the best on the next phase of your journey. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, most of all, I want to thank all of you who are here today -- representatives from more than 50 outstanding companies and organizations all across America. You all range from small startups to multinational corporations. You're leaders in so many different industries -- from aerospace and telecom to financial services and tech. But all of you are here today for one simple reason: Because you know that our veterans and military spouses are some of the most dedicated, skilled, talented people in this country. And I am just thrilled that all of you have pledged to hire more than 110,000 of them, and train 60,000 of them. Thank you so much. (Applause.)\nYou're preparing them for high-tech jobs in some of our fastest-growing industries. And this is key. These jobs offer high salaries, opportunities for advancement and, as you've heard, the flexibility to accommodate the demands of military life.\nSo these jobs are -- they mean more than just the number, because this is real opportunity. These are precisely the kind of jobs we want for our veterans and our spouses. And that's why since we launched Joining Forces back in 2011, we've been reaching out to the business leaders like all of you and urging them to look to our military community for their employment needs.\nAnd year after year, companies have responded. And over the past five years, through Joining Forces and great team members like Nicole and Andy, companies have hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses. And during that same period, our veterans' unemployment rate was literally cut in half. (Applause.)\nAnd I want to be clear that companies didn't just make these commitments because we asked them to or because it was the patriotic thing to do, though it is. As Jeff mentioned, they made these commitments because, time and again, they saw for themselves that our veterans and military spouses are simply the best employees around. And they realized that training and hiring these folks isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do for their bottom lines.\nAnd that is especially true when it comes to tech jobs in industries. The fact is that we have the most technologically advanced armed forces in history. For years, some of the biggest technological innovations -- from the Internet to GPS -- have come from the U.S. military.\nRight now more than 150,000 of our men and women in uniform are already doing tech jobs. Whether it's the staff sergeant who repairs her battalion's communications equipment in the field to the technicians who maintain the software on our fighter jets, to the countless folks working around the clock to protect our networks from cyberattacks -- these people have done their jobs in some of the most challenging environments imaginable.\nSo just think if they can set up wireless networks in Baghdad, or do satellite reconnaissance in the mountains of Afghanistan, I am pretty confident that they can handle whatever is happening in Silicon Valley, right? (Laughter.) But seriously, the bottom line here is simple. Right now so many folks across our military are essentially already working in the tech industry. They just happen to be wearing our country's uniform while they're doing it. So when they decide to transition to civilian life and companies like yours decide to hire them, I know that you will be blown away by everything they have to offer.\nJust take Ryen Macababbad. Ryen is here. Where are you, Ryen? I saw you. I know you're here. There you are. (Laughter.) Ryen, I'm going to embarrass you, too. She started her career in the Army maintaining systems for military intelligence. After completing Microsoft's Software & Systems Academy, she got a job working on Microsoft's cloud technology where she quickly distinguished herself as one of the most talented and passionate employees.\nIn an essay –- this is a quote from you, Ryen -- she said, \"When I'm relaxing, I like to do things that interest me. Learning about different authentication methods and different technologies that connect you to cloud services –- those are the things that I enjoy.\"\nSee that's passion. (Laughter.) I don't even know what that is. (Laughter.) And that's what she likes doing in her spare time. So Ryen is amazing.\nAnd then there's the story of Sarah Dutile whose husband is a Captain in the Army. Sarah? Where's Sarah? There you go, Sarah. Stand up. Let us see you. Sarah works as a talent acquisition operations manager at EMC. And even through multiple deployments and multiple moves across the country –- Massachusetts, Virginia, Washington -- I'm sure I'm missing someplace you've lived -- EMC ensured that Sarah could keep her job. And she won five awards from her managers and was promoted to manage a team of her own.\nSo it was worth it, right? Yes.\nSo folks like Ryen and Sarah don't just bring a host of hard skills to the workplace, they also bring plenty of other qualities that are hard to teach on the job. They have a relentless commitment to excellence. They know how to juggle multiple priorities, and meet tough deadlines, and lead diverse teams. And when it comes to high-pressure situations, when the pressure is the highest, that's usually when our veterans and military spouses are at their best.\nAnd remember, they can bring these skills not just to tech jobs, but to countless other jobs –- from HR to communications to project management. Whatever job you're looking to fill, there are plenty of folks doing that job in the military right now who will be ready to succeed in your company on day one. Flat out.\nThat's why you've all made these commitments today. So thank you for doing your part. Thank you. But, of course, it's going to take all of this. This isn't just your responsibility because even when companies are doing everything right, too often the realities of military life make it hard for folks to take and keep the jobs that you've created.\nFor example, for too long veterans faced all kinds of barriers to applying their military training toward professional licenses and academic degrees. So while someone may have had years of training as an Army medic, for example, hardly any of it would count toward a PA degree or an EMT certification. They'd have to start from scratch, often repeating courses they'd already taken.\nMilitary spouses in careers like nursing, law, real estate, anything that required professional licenses, faced their own set of challenges, because as their families moved from base to base to base -- as you've heard they often do -- they would have to apply for a new license in each new state, often paying hefty fees just to find work. But now, through Joining Forces, we've worked closely with governors and state legislators across the country to address these issues.\nAnd as of today, I'm happy to report that all 50 states have taken action to help veterans get credit for their military training. And 49 out of 50 states have passed laws to help military spouses transfer their licenses from state to state. That's a big deal. (Applause.) And we very much hope that the one remaining state -- (laughter) -- the great state of New York --\nAUDIENCE: Ooh --\nMRS. OBAMA: Mmm -- (laughter) -- will pass legislation to help us solve this problem nationwide. Let's get to 50, New York! Because laws like these aren't just critical for the employment prospects of our veterans and military spouses, they're also critical for the overall health of our military.\nLet's not forget that we still have about 200,000 servicemembers making the transition to civilian life every single year, and their success and their struggles will have an impact on our military for decades to come. See, we have to remember, our military is an all-volunteer force. Everyone who wears our country's uniform today does so by choice. And if we want our best and brightest young people to keep choosing to join our armed forces, they need to see that their service will lead to successful careers -- either in the military, or in civilian life.\nSo that is truly our charge in the years ahead. And today, I want to call on companies and organizations across America to follow the lead that you all are setting and truly commit to hiring and training our veterans and military spouses. We have so many resources to help companies get started.\nThrough the Skillbridge Program at the Department of Defense, companies can start training servicemembers six months before they leave the military so they're ready to start full-time the minute they transition.\nThe Department of Labor runs a veterans' job bank and offers all kinds of assistance that companies can access. And once our vets and military spouses are on board, I hope that companies will take it to the next level, like Amazon is doing, by working to retain and promote them. Because the end goal here isn't just getting folks into entry-level jobs; it's putting them on a career path where they can keep learning new skills, moving up the ladder, and pulling others along with them.\nBecause our veterans and military spouses don't stop learning and serving when they hang up that uniform. They are eager to find their next mission and use their training and talent to serve this country here at home. And giving them that opportunity is the least we can do. And if anyone can make it happen, it's all of you. You all are some of the most innovative, successful businesses in the history of this country. And you all are truly setting the standard on this issue. You're truly showing us what's possible.\nSo we need to keep up this momentum. And I will say this again and again and again: No matter who is in the White House next, this should absolutely continue to be a national priority with national leadership coming from this building. And I know that if folks like you keep leading the way and inspiring others to follow your example, then we can absolutely give our veterans and military spouses the opportunities they deserve. And we can finally serve them as well as they have served this country.\nSo I will end by once again by saying how grateful I am for everything you all have done and everything you will continue to do. And I look forward to continuing our work together in the months and, yes, the years ahead. So no matter where we are, Jill and I are going to be working to finding a way to work with you guys and making sure that you get all the love and attention and support that you've earned, because we are certainly proud of you. We are certainly in awe of you. You make us better people.\nSo thank you all so much. Congratulations on this wonderful commitment. Let's get more people joining in. And God bless you all. Take care.

Today, more than 150,000 men and women in the U.S. military are working in tech jobs—like the developers who create the software for fighter jets and the network engineers who protect our country from cyberattacks.\nAnd whether they were establishing wireless networks in Baghdad, repairing communications equipment in the mountains of Afghanistan, or maintaining data-storage units on 100,000-ton aircraft carriers in the South China Sea, these military personnel have often done their jobs in conditions that most people can't even begin to imagine.\nGiven this experience, chances are that these men and women can handle whatever comes their way in an office building in Silicon Valley. And when they decide to hang up that uniform and make the transition to civilian life, any company that decides to hire or train them will surely benefit from what they have to offer.\nFormer Air Force cyber analyst Donny Greene is a perfect example. Last year, after more than two decades in the military, Donny took a job at a company called RBR-Technologies. Since then, he has already completed numerous certifications, represented the company at multiple conferences and worked tirelessly to develop junior analysts. Today, RBR tells us, customers frequently request Donny by name to support their cyber exercises and operations.\nMany military spouses, who serve and sacrifice right alongside America's men and women in uniform, have similar skills and experience. Sandy Brown's husband is an Army colonel. And even while their family frequently moved from base to base across the country, Sandy continued to excel in her own career. After starting as a software engineer at Raytheon 16 years ago, she is now an area director responsible for $350 million of their business and more than 2,500 employees.\nIn addition to their hard skills, veterans and military spouses like Donny and Sandy also bring plenty of hard-won life skills: an exacting sense of discipline; a commitment to executing missions perfectly every time; the ability to juggle competing priorities; experience managing diverse teams in high-pressure situations.\nIt is therefore not surprising that companies across America have realized that hiring veterans and military spouses isn't just the patriotic thing to do: It's the smart thing to do for their bottom lines.\nThat is why, on Thursday, more than 50 American companies and organizations—from small startups to multinational corporations like Amazon, J.P. Morgan Chase, and AT&T—are pledging to hire more than 110,000 veterans and military spouses and to train more than 60,000 of them.\nThese companies won't be hiring just for tech jobs, but also for the countless other roles that tech firms need to fill, from logistics and administration to human resources and project management. No matter what job a company has open, chances are that America's men and women in uniform have been doing that job already in the military and will show up ready to succeed on day one.\nThe companies making these commitments aren't alone. Since we launched our Joining Forces initiative in 2011 and started asking Americans to honor and support service members, veterans and their families, leaders in many industries—from private equity and construction to transportation and energy—have answered the call. All told, over the past five years the unemployment rate for veterans has been cut in half, and through Joining Forces companies have hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses.\nDespite that remarkable achievement, there is plenty left to be done: 200,000 service members are returning to civilian life every year, and as far as we're concerned, one unemployed veteran is one too many.\nThat is why, no matter who takes our husbands' places next year, we urge them to continue making veteran and military-spouse employment a national priority with leadership from the White House. Giving these men and women an opportunity to find their next mission here at home isn't just good for American businesses, it is one important way that we as a nation can fulfill our obligation to serve them as well as they have served this country.", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Op-Ed Article by the First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden in the Wall Street Journal"}

Escobedo.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117460", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. No, no, I can't. No, no, no.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. All right, let me say, in addition to the Constitution, Michelle will not allow that. [Laughter] Buenas tardes.\nAudience members. Buenas tardes!\nThe President. Feliz Cinco de Mayo! Bienvenidos a la Casa Blanca.\nThis is one of our best fiestas of the year. And I want to thank Yanely for not only the introduction, but for being just—what an unbelievable example of the young people who are going to be leading us in the future. She wasn't even nervous backstage. She knew she was going to do great. So we're so proud of her.\nWe have a couple of guests I want to just make sure to mention. Representative Joaquín Castro is in the house, from the great State of Texas. I know your parents are proud of you, and we're proud of you.\nI want to thank our special guest chef, Johnny Hernandez, who brought his taco and margarita recipes all the way from San Antón. And give it up for our outstanding performers, Maná. I was thinking about coming out and playing. But I decided maybe not. [Laughter] Let me not spoil the party.\nWe all know the story of Cinco de Mayo. A hundred fifty-four years ago, the French, one of the strongest armies of the 19th century, marched on the tiny town of Puebla. An ill-equipped and hastily trained band of Mexican patriots grabbed whatever weapons they could find, and they fought off the opposing forces and eventually regained full independence.\nA hundred fifty years later, Americans and Mexicans still celebrate Cinco de Mayo. In backyard barbeques and baseball parks, from Chicago to Austin, folks are enjoying music and food and good times with family and friends, just like we're doing here today. Earlier, I had a chance to speak with President Peña Nieto of Mexico about our shared work on advancing the prosperity and the security of Americans and Mexicans. And so I wished him a happy Cinco de Mayo. And he asked me to extend the same to you, so I'm doing my duty here. It's a reminder of not just a holiday, but the incredible bonds that our two countries share.\nAudience member. Hey!\nThe President. Hey! [Laughter]\nAnd on my final Cinco de Mayo at the White House, in the company of this extraordinary group, I want to remind everybody of everything we've gotten done. We've been busy. And we couldn't have done it without you. Together, we increased high school and college graduation rates, cutting the Latino dropout rate by more than half since 2000. Together, we ensured that more than 700,000 DREAMers have the opportunity to reach their potential.\nTogether, we continue to fight to fix our broken immigration system. The fact that we weren't able to get it through Congress has been one of the most frustrating aspects of my Presidency. But our ability to take actions within my legal authority to make our immigration system fairer and smarter and more just, I continue to believe, are going to help pave the way for us to finally get the law passed through the next Congress.\nAnd I've got to tell you, I'm going to keep on working on this not just as President, but as a citizen, once I'm leaving here, because I think it's one of the most important things we can get done. Now, in order to do that, everybody has got to follow this young lady's lead and get out there and vote. So we'll have another occasion to talk about that. But we're going to have to have some historic turnout rates come November.\nToday is, really then, not just a celebration of all that we've gotten done, but it's a commitment to continue our work. Change is hard. Sometimes, it takes time. Sometimes, you take two steps forward, and then you have to take one step back. But it's always possible to bring about the change we hope for as long as good people are willing to work together and remain committed, willing to march and organize and vote and educate our friends and our families and our neighbors, and tell the stories of all the incredible people who have contributed to this great Nation of ours who are immigrants, who came from some other places, but ended up weaving their stories together with people from all around the globe to make this unique country we call America.\nChange is possible because of people like you. It's because of people like Efrain Escobedo. I want to tell his story, because Efrain was born in Los Angeles to two immigrants from Mexico. As an oldest child, Efrain took on the role as his parents' advocate, translating for them in school and at the doctor's office. And when he turned 18, eager to exercise his new right to vote, he realized that his parents couldn't vote. He said, I had these two parents who raised me to love this country and worked so hard to be there, and yet, in a very important way, they weren't a part of this democracy.\nThe more Efrain learned about the power of his vote, the more he threw himself into the work of turning whole neighborhoods of people like him into active and engaged citizens. And through the organization where he works, the California Community Foundation, he's worked tirelessly to encourage people to apply for citizenship and become involved in their communities and to vote and to consider running for office themselves.\nIn 2007, with other Latino leaders, he helped lead a campaign to encourage people to become U.S. citizens, and he joined the citizenship campaign I launched last September. And since Efrain's campaign was launched, millions of people have become U.S. citizens and active participants in our democracy. And that just shows you the difference that one person can make. If we use our democracy, he says, it does work, and every vote really does count.\nThroughout this room, all across this land, we're blessed with people like Efrain. And that's what makes strong communities. That's what makes for a strong country. People working to push this country forward, even just a little bit, and then handing it off in better shape for future generations. And that's really what we celebrate here today.\nAnd for that, I want to thank you. For that, I think you've all earned a few margaritas. [Laughter] So thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Viva Mexico.", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Remarks at a Cinco de Mayo Celebration"}

Few Americans fully understand the sacrifices made by those who serve in uniform, but for spouses of service members across our country, the costs of the freedom we too often take for granted are known intimately. On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we honor the spouses of those who have left behind everything they know and love to join our Nation's unbroken chain of patriots, and we recommit to giving military spouses the respect, dignity, and support they deserve.\nEnduring separation and relocation, heartache and anticipation, military spouses demonstrate a strength reflective of the spirit of our Nation. The spouses of our men and women in uniform bear the burden of sustaining their families, caring for children and offering comfort and support while their loved ones are away. As a country, we must keep faith with military spouses and uphold our commitment to the members of our Armed Forces to look after their families.\nFive years ago, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden launched the Joining Forces initiative. Through Joining Forces, my Administration is working to ensure the spouses of our men and women in uniform have good, secure jobs so they can better provide for their families. We launched the Military Spouse Employment Partnership—uniting hundreds of businesses across America in a collaborative effort to employ more military spouses. Additionally, I proposed an increase in funding to help address the barriers that too often hold back transitioning service members and their spouses from greater economic possibility. And I have taken action to improve access to mental health care for our veterans and their families, and to ensure they are able to find adequate housing—because anyone who defended America should have a home in America. I encourage all people to visit www.JoiningForces.gov to learn how to get involved or for more information.\nMilitary spouses exhibit tremendous courage and unyielding faith, and in their spirit of resolve, we see the best of America. Let us celebrate these selfless individuals by supporting them and upholding our everlasting commitment to stand beside them and their families.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2016, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Proclamation 9442—Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 2016"}

Hello, everybody! Give it up for Joe Biden! Oh, it is good to see all of you here today. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat.\nI want to recognize all of our outstanding military leaders who are here.

And I want to thank the USO for the outstanding work that they have done for so many years and it means so much to not only those who serve in uniform but also their families.

The one and only. I do want to mention, though, any jokes told about me, you should not laugh. [Laughter] I'm just kidding. This is actually my second comedy show in the past week. [Laughter] The good news is, there are no tuxedos. [Laughter] And most importantly, I get to spend some time with you, the men and women who make up the greatest fighting force the world's ever seen.\nI know we already did the roll call, but I just want to see if you guys can do it a little bit better this time. [Laughter] And by the way, I'm going to start with Army, because Jon made fun of you. Army! [Applause] There you go. We've got Navy here. [Applause] Air Force is in the house! [Applause] This is an Air Force base. [Laughter] I mean, I'm just saying. You've got a little home field advantage. [Laughter] Marines! [Applause] And Coast Guard. [Applause] All right. Good job, Coast Guard. [Laughter] Military spouses and kids, let's hear you! [Applause]\nIt is—this is a nice way for me to not just say thank you for your service, but to give a particular thanks to Joint Base Andrews, home of the 89th Airlift Wing. Because Joe and I spend a little bit of time on this base. [Laughter] You guys are the ones who take care of our planes. You keep us on time, most of the time. [Laughter] And you're always the first ones to welcome us home. So you mean so much to us. And I'm so glad we're able to do something here so that you guys know we don't take you for granted. And Michelle and I, Joe and Jill, when we come in and out of this base, we know how many people stand behind the planes and the helicopters and all the incredible work that's being done just moving us around every single day. So thank you very much. We really mean it. Thank you.\nThanks for your service here. Thanks for your service around the world. Now, because I'm standing between you and a party, I am going to be the Commander in Brief. [Laughter]\nOne of my greatest honors is to serve you and your families. And that means using our military power wisely. It means sending you into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary. It means making sure that you—our troops, our veterans, your families—are getting the care and the benefits that you've earned. It means cutting the disability claims backlog. It means helping you and your families, whether it's starting a business or pursuing your education under the post-9/11 GI bill. And the good news is, we've made a lot of progress over these past 8 years. But the work of doing right by you and your families is never done. And it is not just a job for Government. And that's why we're here today.\nBack on the campaign in 2008, Michelle sat down with some military spouses, and she was deeply moved by the stories of your service, and your strength, and your resilience. She heard stories of families enduring multiple deployments. This was obviously at a time when we still had 180,000 troops deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan. Spouses and veterans were coming home and struggling to find jobs. Children constantly moving from school to school. And these are stories you live out every day, but they're ones that the rest of the country wasn't always hearing. So Michelle pledged that if she became First Lady, she'd help share those stories far and wide and challenge Americans to stand with you.\nAnd 5 years ago, she teamed up with another formidable force, Jill Biden, to start Joining Forces. As a Blue Star Mom, as a teacher whose dad served in World War II, Jill was already fired up about reaching out to military kids. And together, they wanted to channel what they knew was America's good will towards our military into something concrete and something real. Not just a parade on Veterans Day or Memorial Day, not just honors at a ballgame, but what was happening day to day to make people's lives better. And so Michelle and Jill wanted to help folks answer a question that a lot of people were asking, which is, how can we do more? How can we help more?\nSo they started by focusing on the most basic ingredient of stability and security: a job. In the aftermath of the economic crisis, the unemployment rate overall had reached 10 percent. But for some of our veterans it was even worse. As many as one in four of our youngest vets were looking for jobs. And too many of our military spouses were struggling to find work because their families were constantly relocated.\nSo Michelle and Jill reached out to hundreds of America's biggest brands and employers—companies like Walmart and Disney and Amazon—telling them the same thing I tell CEOs every time, which is, if you want a job done right, hire a vet, hire a military spouse. They know how to handle stress. They know how to do the job. They know how to perform under pressure. They have proven themselves.\nAnd the good news is, over the past 5 years, America's businesses have begun to answer the call. All told, the unemployment rate for veterans has been cut in half, and through Joining Forces, companies have hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses.\nBut Michelle and Jill didn't stop there. They worked with States to change professional licensing laws so that our vets can get credit for your military training and spouses can get hired when you move across State lines. They're working to rally almost 900 mayors and local leaders to get our homeless veterans into housing and to get the support that they need. They help teachers and schools support military students from kindergarten through college. They supported our caregivers and our wounded warriors. And they've worked to destigmatize mental health challenges.\nThey've worked with Hollywood to share your stories with the American people in movies and television. And they've shined a special light on our women servicemembers and our veterans. And they've mobilized communities all across the country to honor and support our military families.\nAll of this just in 5 years. And here's the thing. This event is not the endpoint, it's not the finish line. This is just a marker on the race. It's a mile-marker. Because every year, around 200,000 American heroes are transitioning back into civilian life. And whether it's wartime or peacetime, many of our troops still serve far from home, and families like yours sacrifice. So Michelle and Jill have pledged to keep charging forward on this issue, not just for the next 9 months, but long after we leave office.\nAnd that's why tonight, on this fifth anniversary, I want to renew Michelle and Jill's call from the day they launched this effort. I challenge every American to keep asking that simple question: \"How can I give back to these troops and families who have given me so much?\" Everybody should have that in their minds. Because thanks to Joining Forces, we have answers in terms of how you can help.\nIf you're a business owner, hire more veterans and military spouses. And if you don't know how to do it, let us know. We'll tell you. If you're a teacher, reach out to the military students in your class. And if you need ideas for how to provide more support, Joining Forces will let you know. If you're a mayor or a coworker or a neighbor, go to joiningforces.gov to find out how you can make a difference for military families in your communities. That's how we can concretely show that we have your backs: that it's not just lip service, but we're actually doing something concrete.\nThat's what today is about. I could not be prouder of everything the American people have done and will continue to do through Joining Forces. More importantly, I think I speak for Joe Biden to say I could not be prouder of two people who are as smart and charismatic and committed and dedicated. What they've been able to accomplish with almost no budget, but just through sheer force of will and personality and commitment to you is something that leaves me in awe. I am so proud of them.\nGive it up for two champions for our troops and our veterans and our military families: Michelle Obama and Jill Biden.\nJill T. Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden. Hi. Hello. Thank you to the Commander in Chief, President Obama, for that wonderful introduction. Thank you. And of course, I want to say thank you to my husband, Joe, the Vice President——\nThe President. He's all right. [Laughter]\nMrs. Biden. ——for always supporting and encouraging me to do as much as we can to show our military families how much we appreciate them.\n[At this point, Mrs. Biden made additional remarks, followed by remarks from the First Lady.]", "timestamp": "2016-05-05", "title": "Remarks on the Fifth Anniversary of the Joining Forces Initiative at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland"}

Bernie Sanders on Friday urged Democratic Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz not to stack the committees that will draft the rules and lay out the party platform at this summer's Democratic National Convention.\nIn a letter to the party chairwoman, Sanders said the makeup of the standing committees should reflect the relative level of support that he and Hillary Clinton received in primaries and caucuses. So far, Sanders has won about 45 percent of the pledged delegates. Both campaigns deserve a say at the convention this July in Philadelphia, the senator said.\nUnder party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommends 25 at-large appointments to the party's executive committee for each of the three standing committees; rules, platform and credentials. Wasserman Schultz has forwarded only three of 40 names the Sanders campaign recommended for the key committees while installing Clinton loyalists in leading roles. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was put in charge of the Platform Committee, for example, and former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts was tapped to head the Rules Committee.\nSanders called Malloy and Frank \"aggressive attack surrogates\" for Clinton. He doubted that either would \"conduct committee proceeding in an even-handed manner\" and said the appointments of the two Clinton loyalists \"suggests the standing committees are being established in an overtly partisan way meant to exclude the input of the voters who have supported my candidacy.\"\nHow the party leadership comports itself at the convention will affect Democrats' chances of winning the general election this November, the Vermont senator said.\n\"If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership. That sends the very real message that the Democratic Party is not open to the millions of new people that our campaign has brought into the political process, does not want to hear new voices and is unwilling to respect the broader base of people that this party needs to win over in November and beyond,\" Sanders wrote to Wasserman Schultz.\nThe letter warned that if committee assignments aren't fairly allotted one result could be floor fights. Under party rules, minority reports may be brought before the full convention at the request of 25 percent of the platform, credentials and rules committees.\n\"If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention,\" Sanders wrote.\nRead Sanders' letter to Wasserman Schultz here.", "timestamp": "2016-05-06", "title": "Press Release - Sanders to DNC: Don't Stack the Deck at Philly Convention"}

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123330", "text": "BLITZER: And joining me now, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate.\nSenator Sanders, thanks very much for joining us.\nSANDERS: My pleasure.\nBLITZER: Donald Trump locked up the presidential nomination. He is focusing in on a general election. Here is the question, are you willing to continue to fight Hillary Clinton even if it creates the real possibility that you're going to weaken her potentially in a general election?\nSANDERS: Well, Wolf, I know what you really mean by that question, and that is, am I going to continue in the next nine primaries and caucuses to make sure that I can get every vote that I can? And by the way, we think we can win a good majority of those caucuses.\nDo I think that every American in this country, including in the largest state of California, have a right to cast their vote for who they want to be the next president of the United States and what they want the agenda of the Democratic Party to be? Of course I do. We're going to be in this until the last ballot is cast.\nBLITZER: So far, though, what, she has 3 million more votes than you've had in all the contests today, 300 more pledged delegates. And she also has 513 so-called super delegates to your 41 super delegates.\nWhat are you going to say to the super delegates to try to get them to change their minds?\nSANDERS: Well, first of all, Wolf, we have now won 18 states. And I think by the end of the process, you know, who can predict tomorrow, but I think we've got the shot to win at least half or maybe even a majority of the overall states, maybe 25 or more states.\nSecond of all, in terms of super delegates, this is what I will say -- many super delegates, some 450 of them declared for Hillary Clinton before I even got into the race, before the first ballot was cast. And if you look at national polls today, if you look at state polls, in almost every instance, Bernie Sanders is the stronger candidate against Donald Trump because not only do we get almost all the Democratic votes, we got a lot of the independent votes which is what you're going to need it win in November.\nSo I would say to those super delegates, look, what is most important is we defeat Donald Trump. I believe that I am the strongest candidate against him.\nBLITZER: If she were to get the nomination, would you consider being her vice presidential running mate?\nSANDERS: Well, right now, we are focused in the next five weeks of winning the Democratic nomination. If that does not happen, we're going to fight as hard as we can on the floor of the Democratic convention to make sure that we have a progressive platform that American people will support. And then after that, certainly, Secretary Clinton and I can sit down and talk and see where we good from there.\nBLITZER: I guess an alternative question would be, if she came to you now or relatively soon approached you and offered you the vice presidential running mate slot, would you drop out?\nSANDERS: I think that that is a hypothetical that will not happen and once again, there are nine states left. We think we have a good shot to winning West Virginia on Tuesday. Kentucky and Oregon the next week. And we think we can win in California.\nSo, we're going it fight for every remaining vote in the next nine states. That's where we're at right now.\nBLITZER: Paul Begala, who you know, he's a CNN contributor. He advises a super PAC that supports Hillary Clinton. He wrote an op-ed piece where he said you should stay in the race. He said that. But also said you should focus all of your fire on Donald Trump and not Hillary Clinton. Are you ready to focus entirely right now in coming weeks on Donald Trump?\nSANDERS: Well, I like Paul very, very much. Very smart guy.\nBut I think what the American people want, what is good for American democracy, what is good for the Democratic Party, is a vigorous debate on the real issues facing the American people. At the end of the day, if you engage people in that debate, no matter who they end up voting for, likelihood is they will have a higher voter turnout in November and higher voter turnout in November works for Democrats, because when a lot of people come out, progressives and Democrats win, when people are demoralized and we have a low voter turnout as we did in 2014 that's when Republicans win. So, I will continue to run and issue the campaign. Will I be taken on Donald Trump? Absolutely. Will I be discussing the very important differences of opinion that Secretary Clinton and I have? Yes, I will.\nBLITZER: Donald Trump recently started using some of your own public critiques of Hillary Clinton regarding her judgment. He tweeted this. He said, \"Crooked Hillary has zero leadership ability as Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgment, constantly playing the women's card. It is sad.\"\nDoes that worry you that Trump is using your words against Hillary Clinton?\nSANDERS: Trump, I have never -- you read that tweet. That is nothing that I have ever said about Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton and I disagree on many issues.\nI think her judgment on the war on Iraq was bad. I think her judgment in trade policies where she supported, virtually every one of these disastrous trade policies was bad. I think the fact that she supports $12 minimum wage when clearly we need $15 an hour minimum wage, I think that's bad. I think her creating super PACs and raising money from Wall Street and other special interests, not a great idea.\nBut I've never used the phraseology that Trump is. Look, Trump is in his own world. Obviously he wants to do whatever he can to cause divisions within the Democratic process. But what he just put in his tweet is something that I have never said, never will say.\nBLITZER: Well, you did say she had bad judgment. Right? Are you denying that?\nSANDERS: That's right. Of course, she had bad judgment. Of course. She voted for the war in Iraq.\nBLITZER: But you never spoke about -- [crosstalk]\nSANDERS: That's bad judgment. No, that is nothing I ever talked about.\nClearly, women -- we are reaching out to women as strongly as we can. Donald Trump also says he will go after your supporters. He thinks your supporters will come to him because he says the Democrats are unfair to you, that the Democratic system is rigged against you.\nBLITZER: Do you agree with him?\nSANDERS: Well, I know that Donald Trump is staying up nights worrying about Bernie Sanders. I mean, I know this is just coming from his heart and I know that he doesn't have any ulterior motive in saying those kinds of things.\nBut let me just give Donald Trump some bad news. And that is, number one, if I am the Democratic nominee, I'm going to defeat him and defeat him by a very large margin. If I am not the Democratic nominee, I'm going to do everything that I can to see that he does not get into the White House.\nBLITZER: You just wrote a letter to the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, expressing some of your concerns about the make-up of some of the Democratic convention committee. Let me read a couple lines from it.\nThis is what you wrote: \"As it stands now, chairs of the rules committee and platform committee are active supporters of Secretary Clinton's campaign. But even more than that, they both are aggressive attack surrogates on the campaign trail. I do not, and millions supporting the campaign will not, have any confidence that any of them have they can conduct committee proceedings in an even-handed manner.\"\nAre you suggesting the DNC is stacking the cards against you?\nSANDERS: Of course. What can I say? You got to chairmen there who've been very vigorous in attacking me. But more importantly, of the 40 people that Wasserman Schultz has appointed to the major committees, we have three out of 40 despite the fact that as of today, we have 45 percent of the pledged delegates.\nSo, all that that letter says is, look, the American people are very suspicious of the establishment, the political establishment. Do not create a convention situation where our people do not get fair representation.\nNow, right now, we're at 45 percent. I think by the time this process is over. Frankly, I hope to be at 50 percent, but if we're at 47, 48 percent, that's the kind of representation we want on the committees. That is not an unfair request. That is kind of a -- you know, realistic reasonable request. But if she is giving us three delegates out of 40, and have major chairman, who are going to actively and aggressively campaigning against me, that is not acceptable.\nBLITZER: Senator Bernie Sanders, thanks so much for joining us.\nSANDERS: Thank you, Wolf.", "timestamp": "2016-05-06", "title": "Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN"}

In his remarks, he referred to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, in their capacity as Democratic Presidential candidates.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117614", "text": "The President. All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Seven years ago, in April of 2009, our economy lost nearly 700,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate hit 9 percent on its way to 10 percent.\nSeven years later, in April 2016, our economy added 160,000 new jobs. That makes April the 74th consecutive month of private sector job growth in America. Over that record streak of job growth, our businesses have created 14.6 million new jobs in all. Wages have been rising at an annual rate of more than 3 percent this year.\nSo the unemployment rate [economy; White House correction.] has been growing, unemployment has been falling, and wages have been rising. But the global economy, as many people here are aware, is not growing as fast as it should be. You're still seeing lagging growth in places like Europe, Japan, and now China. Here in the United States, there are folks out there who are still hurting. And so we've got to do everything we can to strengthen the good trends and to guard against some dangerous trends in the global economy. And if the Republican Congress joined us to take some steps that are pretty common sense, then we could put some additional wind at the backs of working Americans.\nTo create new jobs, they should invest in our infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our schools, our water mains. Some of you joined me when I went to Flint this week. It was a great example of the kind of work that is out there to be done. And we could be putting people all across this country back to work, with huge multiplier effects across the economy, if we started investing in the infrastructure that will make us more productive.\nTo reward some of the hardest working people in America, Congress should raise the minimum wage. This is something that would not only help those individuals who are getting a bigger paycheck, but it also means they're spending more, and that would be a boost to business.\nTo level the playing field for American workers and crack down on unfair foreign competition, they should pass smart new trade agreements.\nAnd Congress should reform our Tax Code to promote growth and job creation, which includes closing wasteful loopholes and simplifying the Tax Code for everybody.\nNow, I've been talking about this for a while. Only Congress can fully close the loopholes that wealthy individuals and powerful corporations all too often take advantage of, often at the expense of middle class families. If they're getting out of paying their fair share of taxes, that means that the rest of us have to shoulder that burden. And I've put forward plans repeatedly to do exactly that: close loopholes, make sure that everybody is paying their fair share, which would not only give people greater confidence in the system, but would be good for our economy. It would make sure that families and small businesses, who don't have fancy lawyers and fancy accountants, are being treated the same as big corporations who do. I think it's fair to say the Congress will not act on a big tax reform plan before the election that would shut down some of these loopholes. But what my administration has been doing is to look for steps that we can take on our own to make the tax system fairer.\nIn recent months, we've seen just how big a problem corruption and tax evasion have become around the globe. We saw what happened with the release of the Panama Papers, and we've seen the degree to which both legal practices of tax avoidance that are still unfair and bad for the economy, as well as illegal practices that, in some cases, involve nefarious activities continue to exist and to spread. So combating this kind of tax evasion and strengthening the global financial system have been priorities of mine since I took office. And they're part of our broader, ongoing efforts to make sure the rules aren't rigged and our economy works for everybody.\nLet me give you an example. Here at home, we've made our Tax Code fairer and asked the wealthiest Americans to start paying their fair share. And last month, the Treasury Department took action to prevent more corporations from taking advantage of a tax loophole that let them shift their address abroad just to avoid paying taxes in America, taxes that they rightfully owe.\nWe've taken several steps to make sure that our law—our tax laws are enforced, including leading efforts to crack down on offshore evasion. And as a result, thousands of individuals have come forward to disclose offshore accounts and pay the taxes that they owe, along with interest and penalties.\nToday we're building on those efforts. And I'm—I believe that you've heard from Treasury, but I wanted to amplify what they've told you in detail. Number one, we are requiring banks and other financial institutions to know, verify, and report who the real people are behind shell corporations that set up accounts at those institutions. One of the main ways that companies avoid taxes, or wealthy individuals avoid taxes, is by setting up a bunch of shell corporations and making it harder to trace where monies are flowing and what taxes are owed. We're saying to those financial institutions, you've got to step up and get that information.\nSecond, we're plugging a gap in our tax rules that foreigners can exploit to hide their assets to evade taxes. The Treasury Department and the IRS are issuing a proposed rule to make sure foreigners cannot hide behind anonymous shell companies formed inside the United States.\nNow, these actions are going to make a difference. They will allow us to continue to do a better job of tracking financial flows and making sure that people are paying the taxes that they owe, rather than using shell corporations and offshore accounts to avoid doing the things that ordinary Americans, hard-working Americans are doing every day, and that's making sure that they're paying their fair share.\nHaving said that, we're not going to be able to complete this job unless Congress acts as well. So I'm calling on Congress to pass new legislation that requires all companies formed inside the United States to report information about their real owners to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. That's going to help law enforcement better investigate and prevent financial crimes. I'm calling on Congress to provide the Justice Department with additional tools to investigate corruption and money launderers. And I'm calling on the Senate—in particular, Senator Rand Paul, who's been a little quirky on this issue—to stop blocking the implementation of tax treaties that have been pending for years. And these treaties actually improve law enforcement's ability to investigate and crack down on offshore tax evasion. And I'm assuming that's not something that he's in favor of. So we're going to need to cooperate internationally because tax evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering—these things are all taking place in a global financial system, and if we can't cooperate with other countries it makes us harder for us to crack down.\nIf we can combine the actions that we're taking administratively with the new tools that I'm asking Congress to provide the Justice Department and Treasury, these actions will prevent tax evasion, they'll prevent money laundering, they'll prevent terrorist financing. And they'll, most importantly, uphold a fundamental principle of our economy: In America, no matter how wealthy or powerful, you should play by the same set of rules as everybody else.\nAll right. Thanks. I'm going to take a couple questions. With that, let's see, go ahead, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters]. Since you're now the incoming president of the White House Correspondents' dinner. [Laughter]\n2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, what's your reaction to Donald Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party this week? And given the delegate math, do you think it's time for Bernie Sanders to step aside on the Democratic race?\nThe President. Well, with respect to the Republican process and Mr. Trump, there's going to be plenty of time to talk about his positions on various issues. He has a long record that needs to be examined, and I think it's important for us to take seriously the statements he's made in the past.\nBut most importantly—and I speak to all of you in this room as reporters, as well as the American public— I think—I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the Presidency of the United States.\nAnd what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny. It means that you've got to make sure that their budgets add up. It means that if they say they've got an answer to a problem, that it is actually plausible and that they have details for how it would work. And if it's completely implausible and would not work, that needs to be reported on. And the American people need to know that. If they take a position on international issues that could threaten war or has the potential of upending our critical relationships with other countries or would potentially break the financial system, that needs to be reported on.\nAnd the one thing that I'm going to really be looking for over the next 6 months is that the American people are effectively informed about where candidates stand on the issues, what they believe, making sure that their numbers add up, making sure that their policies have been vetted and that candidates are held to what they've said in the past.\nAnd if that happens, then I'm confident our democracy will work. And that's true whether we're talking about Mr. Trump or Ms. Clinton or Bernie Sanders or anybody else. But what I'm concerned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the circus, because that's not something we can afford. And the American people, they've got good judgment, they've got good instincts, as long as they get good information.\nAll right?\nQ. And on Sanders dropping out? The President. I think on the Democratic side, let's let the process play itself out. You mentioned the delegate math. I think everybody knows what that math is. I think Senator Sanders has done an extraordinary job raising a whole range of issues that are important to Democratic voters as well as the American people, generally. And I know that at some point there's going to be a conversation between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders about how we move towards the convention.\nThe good news is that despite the fact that during the course of primaries everybody starts getting a little chippy—I've been through this, it's natural, sometimes even more with the staffs and supporters than with the candidates themselves—the good news is, is that there's a pretty strong consensus within the Democratic Party on the vast majority of issues.\nThere's some disagreement about tactics. There's some disagreement about political strategy or policy nuance. But both Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders believe that every American should have health care. So do I. Both candidates believe that we should be raising the minimum wage. Both candidates believe that we should invest in our infrastructure and put more people back to work. Both candidates believe that we should pass a comprehensive immigration reform policy that makes sure we're enforcing laws and improving our legal immigration system and making sure our borders are secure, but also that we continue to enjoy the incredible boost that we get from attracting talent from all around the world. Both candidates agree that we should be prudent in terms of how we use our military and that we should care for our veterans when they come home.\nSo if you look at 95 percent of the issues, there's strong agreement there. You don't see the same kinds of divisions between the two Democratic candidates that remain that you've been seeing in some of the Republican debates.\nYes.\n2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, what did Speaker Ryan's comments tell you about the state of the Republican Party? And how would you advise your fellow Democrats, who appear to have to now run against Donald Trump, as to how they can win in November?\nThe President. Well, I think you have to ask Speaker Ryan what the implications of his comments are. There is no doubt that there is a debate that's taking place inside the Republican Party about who they are and what they represent.\nTheir standard bearer at the moment is Donald Trump. And I think not just Republican officials, but more importantly, Republican voters are going to have to make a decision as to whether this is the guy who speaks for them and represents their values.\nI think Republican women voters are going to have to decide, is that the guy I feel comfortable with in representing me and what I care about. I think folks who, historically, have been concerned about making sure that budgets add up and that we are responsible stewards of Government finances have to ask, does Mr. Trump's budgets work. Those are going to be questions that Republican voters, more than Republican officials, have to answer.\nAnd as far as Democrats, I think we run on what we're for, not just on what we're against. For the last 7½ years, we've been pretty clear about what we believe will help working families who are struggling out there. And although it has been difficult to get through Republican Congresses to get those things done, the truth is, is that they continue to be prescriptions that would really help people. Making sure that families get paid sick leave and family leave and early childhood education, that would help families. Raising the minimum wage would help a lot of people. Rebuilding infrastructure would put back to work a whole bunch of guys in hardhats and gals in hardhats that need to work. And those are good jobs that can't be exported. Now is the time to do it.\nSo I want Democrats to feel confident about the policy prescriptions we're putting forward, and the contrast, I think, will be pretty clear. I'll leave it up to the Republicans to figure out how they square their circle.\nAll right. I'm going to take two more questions. Yes, go ahead.\nRepublican Presidential Candidate Donald J. Trump/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, what's your message to Democratic voters who have yet to cast their vote, who may be hesitant to vote for the Democratic frontrunner because of the ongoing e-mail scandal and investigation? And also, did you see Donald Trump's taco bowl tweet, and your thoughts on it?\nThe President. I have no thoughts on Mr. Trump's tweets. As a general rule, I don't pay attention to Mr. Trump's tweets. And I think that will be true, I think, for the next 6 months. So you can just file that one. [Laughter]\nIn terms of the Democratic vote coming up, I'm going to let the voters cast their ballots and not try to meddle in the few primaries that are remaining. Let the process play itself out. We'll know soon enough. It's not going to be that much longer.\nDavid [David Nakamura, Washington Post].\nWashington, DC, Metrorail System/Infrastructure/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. I just wanted to ask you one on infrastructure. Not long before your nuclear summit where you had 50 world leaders here, the DC Metro was closed for over 24 hours.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. You, at the White House Correspondents' dinner, made note that you'll soon be, sort of, a more ordinary District resident. I'm wondering what that says that the Nation's Capital, their own Metro system was closed for 24 hours and is having a number of safety-related problems. And what can your administration do, if Republicans are standing in the way of an infrastructure bill, specifically for the DC Metro, to potentially provide more funding or any more support for such a critical service?\nThe President. Well, first of all, I know this is a somewhat self-interested question, I assume, because a bunch of folks here take the Metro. [Laughter] But it is just one more example of the underinvestments that have been made.\nLook, the DC Metro, historically, has been a great strength of this region, but over time, we underinvested in maintenance and repair. And the steps that are being taken now I'll refer to the Department of Transportation. And—but I can say that obviously safety comes first, and we want to make sure that if there are safety concerns that they're addressed.\nThe broader issue, though, is we've got bridges, we've got roads, we have ports, we have airports, we have water mains and pipes—as we saw in Flint—that suffer from neglect. And in many parts of the country, we're still relying on systems that were built 30, 50, in some cases, 100 years ago. And the reason we've been neglecting them is not because we don't know how to fix them. It's not because people haven't been aware of the need. We've known for years now that we're a trillion or 2 trillion dollars short in terms of necessary infrastructure repair.\nI talked about this when I came into office and sought to do more in terms of investing in our Nation's infrastructure. The problem we have is that the Republican Congress has been resistant to really taking on this problem in a serious way. And the reason is, is because of an ideology that says government spending is necessarily bad.\nAnd I addressed this when I was in Flint. That mindset, that ideology has led to us not investing in those things that we have to do together. As you point out, this Metropolitan area, the Nation's Capital, economically, is actually doing really well. But it doesn't matter much — how big your paycheck is if you've been taking the Metro and suddenly it's shut down for a month. And now you're stuck in traffic trying to drive to work instead.\nYou can't build your own Metro system. You can't build your own highway. You can't build your own airport. And so we have a specific problem with underinvesting in infrastructure. Now is the time, by the way, for us to do so. Interest rates are so low, and there are so many contractors and construction workers that are underemployed at the moment that you can actually get jobs done on time, on schedule. It would give a boost to our overall economy, because we know that when we spend a dollar in infrastructure, then we actually get a bigger bang for the buck in terms of the economy overall.\nSurrounding businesses, suppliers, food trucks—everybody does better. And it gives a huge boost to the economy, and it lasts for a long time. Think about the investments we made in things like the Hoover Dam or the Golden Gate Bridge or Metro. It's a good thing to do. And it, historically, was not, and should not be, partisan. But if we have a mindset that says whatever government is doing must be bad, then these are going to be the results.\nAnd it's going to continue to get worse. It's already tough in poorer communities, like Flint. But we're seeing these kinds of infrastructure problems spring up in communities all across the country. And it doesn't distinguish by race or by region. Everybody needs roads. Everybody needs airports.\nSo, hopefully, this will prompt a conversation. The last thing I'm going to say about this: This is a good example of making sure that the candidates are speaking to this issue as you go into the Presidential election. I've put forward very specific proposals for how I would pay for additional infrastructure investment. The numbers add up. And so the question is, how do the remaining candidates for the Presidency intend to tackle this? How do Members of Congress intend to tackle this? What's the Republican agenda for infrastructure? Do they have one? How do they pay for it? Do they pay for it by cutting Medicare or Medicaid? If they do, that needs to be fleshed out. And the consequences for working families needs to be explained.\nAll right?

We have achieved great progress in tearing down barriers that deny women equal opportunities, but we still have more to do to ensure that health care is a right for every American, regardless of sex or gender. This week, we recommit to ensuring equal access to high-quality care for women and to building a more prosperous, healthy future.\nEnsuring women can live full and healthy lives is vital, and central to that mission is improving the quality, affordability, and accessibility of health care for women. Because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurance companies can no longer charge women more than men or use preexisting conditions—including pregnancy—to deny them the care they need.\nTwenty million Americans have gained health insurance since the passage of the ACA, including roughly 9.5 million women since the first open enrollment period in 2013. Under the Act, annual limits on out-of-pocket spending for essential health benefits have been established, and lifetime and annual limits on insurance coverage have been eliminated. For 55 million women, critical preventive services, including well-woman visits, certain cancer screenings, and domestic violence screenings and counseling sessions, are now guaranteed with no out-of-pocket costs. Access to preventive care can help identify and diagnose conditions early, benefiting countless women across our Nation.\nThe important decisions that affect a woman's health should be left to her alone. Today, efforts around our country to weaken access to contraception and to limit a woman's right to choose threaten to reverse decades of hard-won progress. It is crucial we reject actions that obstruct women's access to sexual and reproductive health services and stand firm in protecting their access to safe, affordable health care and the constitutional right to privacy, including the right to reproductive freedom.\nNational Women's Health Week is an opportunity to refocus our commitment to advancing women's health and ensuring a healthy future for all our Nation's women and girls. To learn more about women's health, and for health care options available for women and girls, visit www.WomensHealth.gov or www.GirlsHealth.gov.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8 through May 14, 2016, as National Women's Health Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate the progress we have made in protecting women's health and to promote awareness, preventive care, and educational activities that improve the health of all women.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-06", "title": "Proclamation 9443—National Women's Health Week, 2016"}

Performing the most important work there is, mothers—biological, foster, or adoptive—are our first role models and earliest motivators. They balance enormous responsibilities and shape who we become as adults, their lessons guiding us throughout life. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status, mothers have always moved our Nation forward and remained steadfast in their pursuit of a better and brighter future for their children.\nCaring and loving without condition, even in our darkest moments, mothers put the interests of their kids ahead of their own. They are inspiring embodiments of strength and determined drivers of progress, and through their example, our youth learn the values of grace, empathy, and kindness. For generations, mothers have led the charge toward a freer, more inclusive country—embracing the task of ensuring our Nation upholds its highest ideals so that they, and America's daughters, know the same opportunities as America's fathers and sons.\nOur country's mothers deserve our unwavering support—at home, in the workplace, and throughout our communities. I am committed to empowering working mothers so they do not have to choose between caring for their family and earning their paycheck, and I will continue fighting to ensure those who choose to become mothers are not financially punished for doing so. My Administration has pushed to expand child care and strengthen paid leave, including maternity leave. We will also keep working to close the gender pay gap—a disparity that is contrary to our values as Americans, limits the scope of mothers' futures, and affects those they provide for. And earlier this year, we launched an effort to help low-income mothers and families afford diapers—a basic necessity for babies—by bringing together online retailers, diaper manufacturers, and nonprofits to reduce the high cost of diapers.\nEach of us is the son or daughter of a mother. Today, let us pay these extraordinary women the admiration and respect they deserve. And each day, let us thank them for all they have done for us, remember those whose spirits remain with us, and support those who take on the awesome mantle of motherhood.\nThe Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as \"Mother's Day\" and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2016, as Mother's Day.

For Donald Trump to casually announce he would consider defaulting on our debt for the first time in our history shows a stunning lack of responsibility and understanding of the global economy. Donald Trump might feel it is fine to renege on his own debts and drive some of his companies in and out of bankruptcy, but that is no way to run the United States economy. If a President Trump made good on his recent proposal to make default a viable economic option for the United States, it would risk a global financial meltdown, drive up interest rates for Americans for decades, and seriously harm middle-class families.\"\nOn Thursday, Trump said in an interview with CNBC that as president he would consider not making good on the country's debt obligations, an action that experts say could imperil the entire United States economy and/or cause a global financial crisis:\nWashington Post: Editorial: Donald Trump sets a new record for economic recklessness\nBusiness Insider: Donald Trump is floating an insane idea that would tank the American economy\nVox: Donald Trump just threatened to cause an unprecedented global financial crisis\nCNN: Donald Trump: 'I'm the king of debt'\nReason: We were kidding about Donald Trump literally taking the U.S. to bankruptcy court, right\nMarket Watch: Donald Trump's plan for the economy: let's copy Greece\nHuffington Post: Great, Donald Trump threatened to default on the national debt\nAmerican Spectator: Donald Trump's dumb plan to default on our debt payments", "timestamp": "2016-05-07", "title": "Statement from Gene Sperling on Donald Trump's Risky Suggestion He Would Consider Defaulting on the National Debt as President"}

In our house, everybody knows that President is only the third most important job in the family. So this weekend, I'm going to take a little extra time to say thank you to Michelle for the remarkable way she does the most important job: being a mom. And I'm going to give extra thanks to my mother-in-law for the role model she's always been to Michelle and the countless selfless ways in which she's helped Michelle and me raise Malia and Sasha. I am incredibly lucky to have these wonderful women to help me raise, love, and look after our girls.\nI hope you'll also take a moment to say thank you to the women in your life who love you in that special way moms do. Biological moms, adoptive moms, and foster moms; single moms, grandmas, and godmothers; aunts, mentors—whomever you think of when you think of Mother's Day. Or take a moment, like I will, to remember the moms who raised us, whose big hearts sustained us, and whom we miss every day, no matter how old we get.\nGiving flowers is always a good idea. But I hope that on this Mother's Day, we'll recommit ourselves to doing more than that: Through deeds that match our words, let's give mothers the respect they deserve, give all women the equality they deserve, and give all parents the support that they need in their most important roles.\nThat includes paid maternity leave and paternity leave, sick leave, accommodations for workers who are pregnant, good health care, affordable childcare, flexibility at work, equal pay, and a decent minimum wage. We ask our moms to do more than their fair share of just about everything. Making sure they're treated fairly is the least we can do.\nThe idea of setting aside a Sunday in May for our mothers became an official holiday with a congressional resolution a little more than a hundred years ago. They did it on May 8, the same day we'll celebrate Mother's Day this year. If Congress can make a holiday, surely they can back it up with the things that give it meaning. After all, that's what my mother taught me. I couldn't just say I was going to do the right thing or say I agreed with it on principle, I had to actually do it.\nSo this Mother's Day, say thank you, say I love you, and let's make sure we show that gratitude and appreciation through acts of respect throughout the year. No one deserves that more than our moms.\nHappy Mother's Day, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-05-07", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Thank you! Hello, Howard! H-U!\nAudience members. You know!\nThe President. H-U!\nAudience members. You know!\nThe President. [Laughter] Thank you so much, everybody. Please, please, have a seat. Oh, I feel important now. [Laughter] Got a degree from Howard. Cicely Tyson said something nice about me. [Laughter]\nAudience member. We love you, President!\nThe President. I love you back.\nTo President Frederick, the Board of Trustees, faculty and staff, fellow recipients of honorary degrees, thank you for the honor of spending this day with you. And congratulations to the class of 2016! Four years ago, back when you were just freshmen, I understand many of you came by my house the night I was reelected. [Laughter] So I decided to return the favor—[laughter]—and come by yours. [Laughter]\nTo the parents, the grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, all the family and friends who stood by this class, cheered them on, helped them get here today: This is your day as well. Let's give them a big round of applause as well.\nI'm not trying to stir up any rivalries here; I just want to see who's in the house. We've got Quad? Annex. Drew. Carver. Slow. Towers.\nAudience member. Meridian.\nThe President. And Meridian. Rest in peace, Meridian. [Laughter] Rest in peace. [Laughter] I know you're all excited today.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. You might be a little tired as well.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Some of you were up all night making sure your credits were in order. [Laughter] Some of you stayed up too late, ended up at HoChi at 2 a.m. [Laughter] Got some mambo sauce on your fingers. [Laughter]\nBut you got here. And you've all worked hard to reach this day. You've shuttled between challenging classes and Greek life. You've led clubs, played an instrument or a sport. You volunteered, you interned, held down one, two, maybe three jobs. You've made lifelong friends and discovered exactly what you're made of. The \"Howard Hustle\" has strengthened your sense of purpose and ambition, which means you're part of a long line of Howard graduates. Some are on this stage today. Some are in the audience. That spirit of achievement and special responsibility has defined this campus ever since the Freedmen's Bureau established Howard just 4 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, just 2 years after the Civil War came to an end. They created this university with a vision: a vision of uplift; a vision for an America where our fates would be determined not by our race, gender, religion, or creed, but where we would be free, in every sense, to pursue our individual and collective dreams.\nIt is that spirit that's made Howard a centerpiece of African American intellectual life and a central part of our larger American story. This institution has been the home of many firsts: the first Black Nobel Peace Prize winner, the first Black Supreme Court Justice. But its mission has been to ensure those firsts were not the last. Countless scholars, professionals, artists, leaders from every field received their training here. The generations of men and women who walked through this yard helped reform our government, cure disease, grow a Black middle class, advance civil rights, shape our culture. The seeds of change for all Americans were sown here. And that's what I want to talk about today.\nAs I was preparing these remarks, Vernon, I realized that when I was first elected President, most of you, the class of 2016, were just starting high school. Today you're graduating college. I used to joke about being old. Now I realize I'm old. [Laughter] It's not a joke anymore. [Laughter]\nBut seeing all of you here gives me some perspective. It makes me reflect on the changes that I've seen over my own lifetime. So let me begin with what may sound like a controversial statement, a hot take. Given the current state of our political rhetoric and debate, let me say something that may be controversial, and that is this: America is a better place today than it was when I graduated from college. Let me repeat: America is by almost every measure better than it was when I graduated from college. It also happens to be better off than when I took office, but—[laughter]—that's a longer story. That's a different discussion—[laughter]—for another speech.\nBut think about it. I graduated in 1983. New York City, America's largest city, where I lived at the time, had endured a decade marked by crime and deterioration and near bankruptcy. And many cities were in similar shape. Our Nation had gone through years of economic stagnation, the stranglehold of foreign oil, a recession where unemployment nearly scraped 11 percent. The auto industry was getting its clock cleaned by foreign competition. And don't even get me started on the clothes—[laughter]—and the hairstyles. [Laughter] I've tried to eliminate all photos of me from this period. I thought I looked good. [Laughter] I was wrong. [Laughter]\nSince that year—since the year I graduated—the poverty rate is down. Americans with college degrees, that rate is up. Crime rates are down. America's cities have undergone a renaissance. There are more women in the workforce. They're earning more money. We've cut teen pregnancy in half. We've slashed the African American dropout rate by almost 60 percent, and all of you have a computer in your pocket—[laughter]—that gives you the world at the touch of a button. In 1983, I was part of fewer than 10 percent of African Americans who graduated with a bachelor's degree. Today, you're part of more than 20 percent who will. And more than half of Blacks say we're better off than our parents were at our age and that our kids will be better off too.\nSo America is better. And the world is better too. A wall came down in Berlin. An Iron Curtain was torn asunder. The obscenity of apartheid came to an end. A young generation in Belfast and London have grown up without ever having to think about IRA bombs. In just the past 16 years, we've come from a world without marriage equality to one where it's a reality in nearly two dozen countries. Around the world, more people live in democracies. We've lifted more than 1 billion people from extreme poverty. We've cut the child mortality rate worldwide by more than half.\nAmerica is better. The world is better. And stay with me now: Race relations are better since I graduated. That's the truth. No, my election did not create a postracial society. I don't know who was propagating that notion. That was not mine. But the election itself—and the subsequent one, because the first one, folks might have made a mistake. [Laughter] The second one, they knew what they were getting. [Laughter] The election itself was just one indicator of how attitudes had changed.\nAudience member. Four more!\nThe President. In my Inaugural Address, I remarked that just 60 years earlier, my father might not have been served in a DC restaurant, at least not certain of them. There were no Black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Very few Black judges. Shoot, as Larry Wilmore pointed out last week—[laughter]—a lot of folks didn't even think Blacks had the tools to be a quarterback. Today, former Bull Michael Jordan isn't just the greatest basketball player of all time, he owns the team. [Laughter] When I was graduating, the main Black hero on TV was Mr. T. [Laughter] Rap and hip-hop were counterculture, underground. Now, Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday night, and Beyoncé runs the world. [Laughter] We're no longer entertainers, we're producers, studio executives. No longer small-business owners, we're CEOs.\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. We're mayors, Representatives——\nAudience member. President of the——\nThe President. ——Presidents of the United States.\nNow, I am not saying gaps do not persist. Obviously, they do. Racism persists. Inequality persists.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Don't worry, I'm going to get to that. [Laughter] But I wanted to start, class of 2016, by opening your eyes to the moment that you are in. If you had to choose one moment in history in which you could be born, and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be—what nationality, what gender, what race, whether you'd be rich or poor, gay or straight, what faith you'd be born into—you wouldn't choose a hundred years ago. You wouldn't choose the fifties or the sixties or the seventies. You'd choose right now.\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. If you had to choose a time to be, in the words of Lorraine Hansberry, \"young, gifted, and Black\" in America, you would choose right now.\nI tell you all this because it's important to note progress. Because to deny how far we've come would do a disservice to the cause of justice, to the legions of foot soldiers, to not only the incredibly accomplished individuals who have already been mentioned, but your mothers and your dads and grandparents and great-grandparents, who marched and toiled and suffered and overcame to make this day possible. I tell you this not to lull you into complacency, but to spur you into action. Because there's still so much work to do, so many more miles to travel. And America needs you to gladly, happily take up that work. You all have some work to do. So enjoy the party—[laughter]—because you're going to be busy. [Laughter] Yes, our economy has recovered from crisis stronger than almost any other in the world. But there are folks of all races who are still hurting, who still can't find work that pays enough to keep the lights on, who still can't save for retirement. We've still got a big racial gap in economic opportunity. The overall unemployment rate is 5 percent, but the Black unemployment rate is almost 9. We've still got an achievement gap when Black boys and girls graduate high school and college at lower rates than White boys and White girls. Harriet Tubman may be going on the twenty, but we've still got a gender gap when a Black woman working full time still earns just 66 percent of what a White man gets paid.\nWe've got a justice gap when too many Black boys and girls pass through a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. This is one area where things have gotten worse. When I was in college, about half a million people in America were behind bars. Today, there are about 2.2 million. Black men are about six times likelier to be in prison right now than White men.\nAround the world, we've still got challenges to solve that threaten everybody in the 21st century: old scourges like disease and conflict, but also new challenges, from terrorism and climate change.\nSo make no mistake, class of 2016, you've got plenty of work to do. But as complicated and sometimes intractable as these challenges may seem, the truth is, is that your generation is better positioned than any before you to meet those challenges, to flip the script.\nNow, how you do that, how you meet these challenges, how you bring about change will ultimately be up to you. My generation, like all generations, is too confined by our own experience, too invested in our own biases, too stuck in our ways to provide much of the new thinking that will be required. But us old heads have learned a few things that might be useful in your journey. So, with the rest of my time, I'd like to offer some suggestions for how young leaders like you can fulfill your destiny and shape our collective future, bend it in the direction of justice and equality and freedom.\nFirst of all—and this should not be a problem for this group—be confident in your heritage.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Be confident in your Blackness. One of the great changes that's occurred in our country since I was your age is the realization there's no one way to be Black. Take it from somebody who's seen both sides of debate about whether I'm Black enough. [Laughter] Past couple months, I've had lunch with the Queen of England and hosted Kendrick Lamar in the Oval Office. [Laughter] There is no straitjacket, there's no constraints, there's no litmus test for authenticity.\nLook at Howard. One thing most folks don't know about Howard is how diverse it is.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. When you arrived here, some of you were, like, oh, they've got Black people in Iowa? [Laughter] But it's true. This class comes from big cities and rural communities, and some of you crossed oceans to study here. You shatter stereotypes. Some of you come from a long line of Bison. Some of you are the first in your family to graduate from college. You all talk different, you all dress different. You're Lakers fans, Celtics fans, maybe even some hockey fans. Audience member. [Inaudible]\nAudience members. [Laughter]\nThe President. And because of those who've come before you, you have models to follow. You can work for a company or start your own. You can go into politics or run an organization that holds politicians accountable. You can write a book that wins the National Book Award, or you can write the new run of \"Black Panther.\" Or, like one of your alumni, Ta-Nehisi Coates, you can go ahead and just do both. You can create your own style, set your own standard of beauty, embrace your own sexuality. Think about an icon we just lost, Prince. He blew up categories. People didn't know what Prince was doing. [Laughter] And folks loved him for it.\nYou need to have the same confidence. Or as my daughters tell me all the time, \"You be you, Daddy.\" [Laughter] Sometimes, Sasha puts a variation on it: \"You do you, Daddy.\" [Laughter] And because you're a Black person doing whatever it is that you're doing, that makes it a Black thing. [Laughter] Feel confident.\nSecond, even as we each embrace our own beautiful, unique, and valid versions of our Blackness, remember the tie that does bind us as African Americans, and that is our particular awareness of injustice and unfairness and struggle. That means we cannot sleepwalk through life. We cannot be ignorant of history. We can't meet the world with a sense of entitlement. We can't walk by a homeless man without asking why a society as wealthy as ours allows that state of affairs to occur. We can't just lock up a low-level dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childhood, felt he had no other options. We have cousins and uncles and brothers and sisters who we remember were just as smart and just as talented as we were, but somehow got ground down by structures that are unfair and unjust.\nAnd that means we have to not only question the world as it is and stand up for those African Americans who haven't been so lucky. Because, yes, you've worked hard, but you've also been lucky. That's a pet peeve of mine: People who have been successful and don't realize they've been lucky. That God may have blessed them; it wasn't nothing you did. So don't have an attitude. But we must also expand our moral imaginations to understand and empathize with all people who are struggling, not just Black folks who are struggling—the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender person, and yes, the middle-aged White guy who may—you may think has all the advantages, but over the last several decades has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change and feels powerless to stop it. You've got to get in his head too.\nNumber three, you have to go through life with more than just passion for change, you need a strategy. I'll repeat that: I want you to have passion; you have to have a strategy. Not just awareness, but action. Not just hashtags, but votes.\nYou see, change requires more than righteous anger. It requires a program, and it requires organizing. At the 1964 Democratic Convention, Fannie Lou Hamer—5 feet 4 inches tall—gave a fiery speech on the national stage. But then, she went back home to Mississippi and organized cotton pickers. And she didn't have the tools and technology where you can whip up a movement in minutes. She had to go door to door. And I'm so proud of the new guard of Black civil rights leaders who understand this. It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened—White, Black, Democrat, Republican—to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system. But to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough. It requires changes in law, changes in custom. If you care about mass incarceration, let me ask you: How are you pressuring Members of Congress to pass the criminal justice reform bill now pending before them? If you care about better policing, do you know who your district attorney is? Do you know who your State's attorney general is? Do you know the difference? Do you know who appoints the police chief and who writes the police training manual? Find out who they are, what their responsibilities are. Mobilize the community, present them with a plan, work with them to bring about change, hold them accountable if they do not deliver. Passion is vital, but you've got to have a strategy.\nAnd your plan better include voting, not just some of the time, but all of the time. It is absolutely true that 50 years after the Voting Rights Act, there are still too many barriers in this country to vote. There are too many people trying to erect new barriers to voting. This is the only advanced democracy on Earth that goes out of its way to make it difficult for people to vote.\nAudience member. Yes.\nThe President. And there's a reason for that. There's a legacy to that.\nBut let me say this: Even if we dismantled every barrier to voting, that alone would not change the fact that America has some of the lowest voting rates in the free world. In 2014, only 36 percent of Americans turned out to vote in the midterms: second lowest participation rate on record. Youth turnout—that would be you—was less than 20 percent. Less than 20 percent. Four out of five did not vote. In 2012, nearly two in three Americans—African Americans turned out. And then, in 2014, only two in five turned out. You don't think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I've got to deal with? [Laughter] And then, people are wondering, well, why—how come Obama hasn't gotten this done? How come he didn't get that done? [Laughter] You don't think that made a difference? What would have happened if you had turned out at 50, 60, 70 percent, all across this country? People try to make this political thing really complicated. Like, well, what kinds of reforms do we need? And how do we need to do that, and what? You know what, just vote. [Laughter] It's math. If you have more votes than the other guy, you get to do what you want. [Laughter] It's not that complicated.\nAnd you don't have excuses. You don't have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap to register to vote. You don't have to risk your life to cast a ballot. Other people already did that for you. Your grandparents, your great-grandparents—might be here today—they were working on it. What's your excuse? When we don't vote, we give away our power, disenfranchise ourselves, right when we need to use the power that we have, right when we need your power to stop others from taking away the vote and rights of those more vulnerable than you are: the elderly and the poor, the formerly incarcerated trying to earn their second chance.\nSo you've got to vote all the time, not just when it's cool, not just when it's time to elect a President, not just when you're inspired. It's your duty. When it's time to elect a Member of Congress or a city councilman or a school board member or a sheriff. That's how we change our politics; by electing people at every level who are representative of and accountable to us. It is not that complicated. Don't make it complicated.\nAnd finally, change requires more than just speaking out. It requires listening as well. In particular, it requires listening to those with whom you disagree and being prepared to compromise. When I was a State senator, I helped pass Illinois's first racial profiling law and\none of the first laws in the Nation requiring the videotaping of confessions in capital cases. And we were successful because, early on, I engaged law enforcement. I didn't say to them, oh, there's—you guys are so racist, I—you need to do something. I understood, as many of you do, that the overwhelming majority of police officers are good and honest and courageous and fair and love the communities they serve.\nAnd we knew there were some bad apples and that even good cops with the best of intentions—including, by the way, African American police officers—might have unconscious biases, as we all do. So we engaged, and we listened, and we kept working until we built consensus. And because we took the time to listen, we crafted legislation that was good for the police, because it improved the trust and cooperation of the community, and it was good for the communities, who were less likely to be treated unfairly. And I can say this unequivocally: Without at least the acceptance of the police organizations in Illinois, I could never have gotten those bills passed. It's very simple. They would have blocked them.\nThe point is, you need allies in a democracy. That's just the way it is. It can be frustrating, and it can be slow. But history teaches us that the alternative to democracy is always worse. That's not just true in this country. It's not a Black or White thing. Go to any country where the give and take of democracy has been repealed by one-party rule, and I will show you a country that does not work.\nAnd democracy requires compromise, even when you are a hundred-percent right. This is hard to explain sometimes. You can be completely right, and you still are going to have to engage folks who disagree with you. If you think that the only way forward is to be as uncompromising as possible, you will feel good about yourself, you will enjoy a certain moral purity, but you're not going to get what you want. And if you don't get what you want long enough, you will eventually think the whole system is rigged. And that will lead to more cynicism and less participation and a downward spiral of more injustice and more anger and more despair. And that's never been the source of our progress. That's how we cheat ourselves of progress.\nWe remember Dr. King's soaring oratory, the power of his \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail,\" the marches he led. But he also sat down with President Johnson in the Oval Office to try and get a Civil Rights Act and a Voting Rights Act passed. And those two seminal bills were not perfect, just like the Emancipation Proclamation was a war document as much as it was some clarion call for freedom. Those mileposts of our progress were not perfect. They did not make up for centuries of slavery or Jim Crow or eliminate racism or provide for 40 acres and a mule. But they made things better. And you know what, I will take better every time. I always tell my staff: Better is good, because you consolidate your gains and then you move on to the next fight from a stronger position.\nBrittany Packnett, a member of the Black Lives Matter movement and Campaign Zero, one of the Ferguson protest organizers, she joined our Task Force on 21st-Century Policing. Some of her fellow activists questioned whether she should participate. She rolled up her sleeves; she sat at the same table with big city police chiefs and prosecutors. And because she did, she ended up shaping many of the recommendations of that Task Force. And those recommendations are now being adopted across the country, changes that many of the protesters called for. If young activists like Brittany had refused to participate out of some sense of ideological purity, then those great ideas would have just remained ideas. But she did participate. And that's how change happens.\nAmerica is big, and it is boisterous, and it is more diverse than ever. The president told me that we've got a significant Nepalese contingent here at Howard. I would not have guessed that. [Laughter] Right on. But it just tells you how interconnected we're becoming. And with so many folks from so many places, converging, we are not always going to agree with each other.\nAnother Howard alum, Zora Neale Hurston, once said—this is a good quote here—\"Nothing that God ever made is the same thing to more than one person.\" Think about that. That's why our democracy gives us a process designed for us to settle our disputes with argument and ideas and votes instead of violence and simple majority rule.\nSo don't try to shut folks out, don't try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There's been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view or disrupt a politician's rally. Don't do that, no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. Because as my grandmother used to tell me, every time a fool speaks, they are just advertising their own ignorance. [Laughter] Let them talk. Let them talk. If you don't, you just make them a victim, and then they can avoid accountability.\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't challenge them. Have the confidence to challenge them: confidence in the rightness of your position. There will be times when you shouldn't compromise your core values, your integrity, and you will have the responsibility to speak up in the face of injustice. But listen. Engage. If the other side has a point, learn from them. If they're wrong, rebut them. Teach them. Beat them on the battlefield of ideas. And you might as well start practicing now, because one thing I can guarantee you, you will have to deal with ignorance, hatred, racism, foolishness, trifling folks. [Laughter] I promise you, you will have to deal with all that at every stage of your life. That may not seem fair, but life has never been completely fair. Nobody promised you a \"crystal stair.\" And if you want to make life fair, then you've got to start with the world as it is.\nSo that's my advice. That's how you change things. Change isn't something that happens every 4 years or 8 years; change is not placing your faith in any particular politician and then just putting your feet up and saying, okay, go. [Laughter] Change is the effort of committed citizens who hitch their wagons to something bigger than themselves and fight for it every single day.\nThat's what Thurgood Marshall understood, a man who once walked this yard, graduated from Howard Law, went home to Baltimore, started his own law practice. He and his mentor, Charles Hamilton Houston, rolled up their sleeves, and they set out to overturn segregation. They worked through the NAACP, filed dozens of lawsuits, fought dozens of cases. And after nearly 20 years of effort—20 years—Thurgood Marshall ultimately succeeded in bringing his righteous cause before the Supreme Court and securing the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that separate could never be equal. Twenty years.\nMarshall, Houston, they knew it would not be easy. They knew it would not be quick. They knew all sorts of obstacles would stand in their way. They knew that even if they won, that would just be the beginning of a longer march to equality. But they had discipline. They had persistence. They had faith and a sense of humor. And they made life better for all Americans.\nAnd I know you graduates share those qualities. I know it because I've learned about some of the young people graduating here today. There's a young woman named Ciearra Jefferson, who's graduating with you. And I'm just going to use her as an example. I hope you don't mind, Ciearra. Ciearra grew up in Detroit and was raised by a poor single mom who worked 7 days a week in an auto plant. And for a time, her family found themselves without a place to call home. And they bounced around between friends and family who might take them in. By her senior year, Ciearra was up at 5 a.m. every day, juggling homework, extracurricular activities, volunteering, all while taking care of her little sister. But she knew that education was her ticket to a better life. So she never gave up. Pushed herself to excel. This daughter of a single mom who works on the assembly line turned down a full scholarship to Harvard to come to Howard.\nAnd today, like many of you, Ciearra is the first in her family to graduate from college. And then, she says, she's going to go back to her hometown, just like Thurgood Marshall did, to make sure all the working folks she grew up with have access to the health care they need and deserve. And she puts it, she's going to be a \"change agent.\" She's going to reach back and help folks like her succeed. And people like Ciearra are why I remain optimistic about America. Young people like you are why I never give in to despair.\nJames Baldwin once wrote, \"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\" Graduates, each of us is only here because someone else faced down challenges for us. We are only who we are because someone else struggled and sacrificed for us. That's not just Thurgood Marshall's story or Ciearra's story or my story or your story, that is the story of America: a story whispered by slaves in the cotton fields, the song of marchers in Selma, the dream of a King in the shadow of Lincoln, the prayer of immigrants who set out for a new world, the roar of women demanding the vote, the rallying cry of workers who built America, and the GIs who bled overseas for our freedom.\nNow it's your turn. And the good news is, you're ready. And when your journey seems too hard, and when you run into a chorus of cynics who tell you that you're being foolish to keep believing or that you can't do something or that you should just give up or you should just settle, you might say to yourself a little phrase that I've found handy these last 8 years: Yes, we can.\nCongratulations, class of 2016! Good luck! God bless you. God bless the United States of America. I'm proud of you.", "timestamp": "2016-05-07", "title": "Commencement Address at Howard University"}

This is the kind of grassroots democracy that will help the Democratic Party grow and win elections.\"\nMaine is one of several states where Sanders scored landslide victories but where most of the so-called superdelegates - elected officials and party insiders - have lined up behind Hillary Clinton.\nSanders won Maine's March 6 caucuses with 64 percent of the vote to Clinton's 36 percent. As a result, Maine's delegation will include 17 elected delegates pledged to Sanders and eight for Clinton. Despite the lopsided outcome in Sanders' favor, three of Maine's five superdelegates still back Clinton. One supports Sanders and one remains uncommitted. Under Maine's new rules, Sanders would have three superdelegates to Clinton's two.\nSuperdelegates have ignored rank-and-file Democrats in other states too.\nIn the state of Washington, 73 percent of the caucus-goers backed Sanders last March 26. Clinton has 10 super delegates. He has zero.\nIn Minnesota, Clinton has 11 superdelegates to Sanders' three despite his 61 percent support in the March 1 caucuses.\nIn Colorado, Sanders won with 59 percent on March 1 but Clinton has 10 superdelegates and he has none.\nIn New Hampshire, Sanders on Feb. 9 won more than 60 percent of the popular vote with more votes than any candidate in the 100-year history of the primary. Still, all six superdelegates remain committed to Clinton.\n\"Superdelegates in states where either candidate has won landslide victories ought to reflect the decision of the people in their states,\" Sanders said.\nThe Maine rule change won't affect this year's contest between Sanders and Clinton. For fear of being penalized at this summer's national convention in Philadelphia, the new Maine plan won't take effect until 2020.

John McCain called on Donald Trump to apologize for his disdain for the brave men and women who have served our country. Echoing that call, more than 50 veterans released a joint statement urging Trump to start showing respect for veterans, including immediately donating the millions of dollars that he allegedly raised in their name months ago, which remain unaccounted for:\n\"Donald Trump recently discovered a new love for America's veterans, promising that a Trump administration will 'treat them really, really well.' Yet after a publicity stunt earlier this year when he ditched a GOP debate to hold an event on behalf of veterans, his campaign still hasn't distributed more than half of the $6 million dollars it allegedly raised. They don't even know where that money has gone. And worse, this is part of a long pattern of the real Donald J. Trump, who for over a decade tried to get disabled veterans, legally operating as street vendors, thrown off of Fifth Avenue in New York City. He said that these Americans, who were simply trying to earn a living in the country they gave so much to defend, were 'clogging and seriously downgrading the area.'\"\n\"And yet, even as Donald Trump denigrates our nation's current veterans, he's putting our future veterans at risk with a risky and incoherent foreign policy. Republican and Democratic national security professionals agree that a Trump administration would make America dangerously less safe while reducing its standing and influence in the world. His embrace of both military adventurism and isolationism, and his support of the use of torture will not only recklessly place our troops in harm's way, but will dramatically increase the risk to our service members serving in operations overseas. Trump's policies are detrimental to the young men and women who volunteer to serve this country, from the moment they join the armed services to the end of their career, civilian or military. He can't be trusted, by our veterans or anyone else.\"\n\"It's time for Donald Trump to stop using vets as political props, donate the rest of the money he raised and build a real understanding of the needs and concerns of the men and women who have served America.\"\nSigners:\nFormer Senator Max Cleland, Captain, U.S. Army, 1965-1968\nCongressman Ruben Gallego, Corporal, U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, 2000-2006\nCongressman Seth Moulton, Captain, U.S. Marine Corps, 2001-2008\nState Senator Pat Spearman, Lt.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117563", "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. - Bernie Sanders' policy director, Warren Gunnels, released the following statement after the Tax Policy Center released an analysis of the senator's proposals.\nWe are pleased the Tax Policy Center recognizes that a major part of Senator Sanders' economic agenda - making public colleges and universities tuition free, substantially reducing student debt, expanding Social Security, and providing 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave - would help rebuild the middle class without increasing the deficit.\nIn terms of our health care plan, the good news is that the Tax Policy Center recognizes that Senator Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan will provide health care as a right, not a privilege, to everyone in America - immediately covering more than 28 million uninsured Americans.\nEven better, this report estimates that low-and-middle-income households would experience a much bigger increase in their income than our own projections. According to the Tax Policy Center, middle-income households would receive an average gain of more than $8,500 a year and low-income households would gain an average of $10,000 a year under Bernie's Medicare-for-all plan.\nBy eliminating private health insurance premiums, deductibles, and co-payments, 95 percent of the American people will see their incomes go up through Bernie's universal health care plan - which is what we have been saying throughout this campaign.\nThe bad news is that the Tax Policy Center wildly overestimates the cost of Senator Sanders' health care plan.\nThe fact of the matter is that the U.S. spends far more per capita on health care with worse health outcomes than any major country on earth. And, unlike every major country on earth, over 28 million of our people are still uninsured.\nIn 2013, the U.S. spent about three times as much per capita on health care than Britain and about twice as much as Canada and France. If every other major country can spend less on health care and insure all of their people, so can the U.S.\nHere is where the Tax Policy Center is wrong:\nFirst, it assumes that state and local governments will dump all of their health care obligations onto the federal government at a cost of $4.1 trillion over the next decade. That is categorically false. Bernie's plan requires state and local governments to maintain their current levels of health care spending - a maintenance of effort that has been upheld by the courts.\nSecondly, this study significantly underestimates the savings in administration, paperwork, and prescription drug prices that every major country on earth has successfully achieved by adopting a universal health care program.\nThe Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) has estimated that we could save nearly $500 billion annually on paperwork and administration alone - enough savings not only to provide universal coverage to the uninsured, but also to eliminate deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance for everyone in America. Hospitals currently spend over 25 percent on administrative costs in this country, but just 12.4 percent in Canada.\nThird, the authors of this report estimate that the cost of our plan would be about $8 trillion more than even the highest cost estimates to date — estimates that have already been debunked by the experts at Physicians for a National Health Program.\nAt a time when 50 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured we must guarantee health care as a right so that no American is one bad illness or accident away from financial catastrophe.

Bill:\n\"This morning, Donald Trump was asked point blank if he supported the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, and he said no. For a candidate who talks a big game about helping veterans, this is a rather astonishing statement. As a veteran myself, I understand just how instrumental this legislation has been in ensuring that the brave men and women who serve our country have every opportunity to succeed when they finish their service. Our vets simply cannot risk a president who doesn't understand their needs.\nFurthermore, Trump falsely attacked Hillary Clinton's commitment to veterans, baselessly claiming that she thinks the 'vets are getting too much.' That couldn't be further from the truth. As a Senator, Hillary Clinton repeatedly worked across the aisle to successfully expand veterans' benefits. And on this campaign she has laid out a comprehensive plan to enhance support for our veterans, including a commitment to fight any efforts to the weaken the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill. Donald Trump should stop making false attacks, stop offering empty rhetoric to our veterans, and start offering them the respecting and support they deserve.\"\nBackground:\n*\nDonald Trump on New Day, 5/9/16:\nCHRIS CUOMO: On the military, you raise an important issue. We tried to get your campaign and the other campaigns to hold forth on whether or not they supported the current G.I. bill. As you know, in the Congress, they did this sneaky vote in the House where there was no roll call, and they were going to cut money from the G.I. bill to allow for other expenditures for vets. The vets were very upset. They said 'no, don't take money from us and reallocate it. Find the savings elsewhere.'\nDo you support maintaining the G.I. bill the way it is right now and even growing it instead of cutting it?\nDONALD TRUMP: I don't want to be hurting our vets. Our vets have been hurt enough. We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets. So I'm going to do nothing to hurt our vets. I'm going to only help the vets --\nCHRIS CUOMO: So is that a yes? --\nDONALD TRUMP: -- unlike Hillary Clinton, that thinks the vets are getting too much. And they're not getting too much. I've traveled, I've seen so many vets, I know so many vets now, and I have a lot of friends -- I have developed great friendships among the vets. Our vets are being treated so badly --\nCHRIS CUOMO: So is that a yes, I do support the current G.I. bill?\nDONALD TRUMP: No. I want to bring jobs back to our country.\n*\nAccording to the VA, over 700,000 veterans and their family members have already benefitted from the Post-9/11 G.I Bill, receiving over $20 billion in benefits.\n*\nHillary Clinton has been a strong and consistent supporter of the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill. Clinton voted for the bipartisan bill in 2008, which passed the Senate with an overwhelming 92-6 vote, and co-sponsored an earlier version of the bill. Her comprehensive veterans' plan calls for making \"the Post-9/11 GI Bill a lasting part of the nation's social contract with those who serve.\" Moreover, she released a statement earlier this year denouncing Republican efforts to chip away at the bill's benefits, and has called for closing a loophole in the bill that allows for-profit colleges to target veterans.\n*\nAs a Senator, Clinton repeatedly worked across the aisle to expand benefits to veterans. Clinton worked with Sen. Lindsey Graham to expand veterans' access to military health insurance, with Sen. John McCain to fund a new rehabilitation center for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, introduced legislation with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson to expand benefits afforded to surviving spouses, and joined with Sen. Chuck Hagel to support legislation to increase gratuities paid to family members of fallen veterans.\n*\nThe Hill, 5/8/16: Veterans call on Trump to show respect: \"More than 50 veterans released a statement Sunday calling on presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump to show respect for the country's veterans and donate the millions of dollars he allegedly raised during a fundraiser several months ago.\"\n*Rep.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117424", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:16 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Let me do a couple of announcements at the top before getting to your questions. The first is that, as you all know, today the President convened his National Security Council here at the White House as part of an ongoing review of our efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL. Today's meeting was the latest in a series of NSC meetings in recent months convened at the White House and at key departments and agencies, including most recently, the CIA, but also the Department of State and the Department of Defense.\nThe President was briefed on ongoing U.S. and coalition efforts to degrade ISIL's core in Iraq and in Syria, while also checking ISIL's ambitions for expansion outside those countries. Noting recent efforts to reinforce the cessation of hostilities in Syria, the President and his team also discussed options to further advance a political resolution to the Syrian civil conflict while continuing our efforts to pressure ISIL there. The President directed his National Security Council to continue to intensify our counter-ISIL operations across all military and civilian fronts, including disrupting foreign fighter networks, halting ISIL's expansion outside of Syria and Iraq, countering ISIL financing, disrupting any ISIL external plotting efforts and, of course, countering ISIL's propaganda and messaging.\nIn addition to that, you may not know that Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco is in Brussels, Belgium today, where she will meet with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and other Belgian security and intelligence officials in our shared efforts to disrupt terrorist plotting against the United States and Europe, and to degrade and destroy ISIL. Ms. Monaco will also meet with senior EU officials to discuss how we can support EU efforts to strengthen counterterrorism coordination amongst its members.\nMs. Monaco's travel to Belgium is one of a series of high-level engagements we're undertaking with our coalition partners to discuss ways we can enhance our counterterrorism cooperation.\nThe people of Brussels know all too well that ISIL continues to both plot complex attacks against our interests and seeks to inspire lone wolves to attack us independently of ISIL command and control. That is why we are constantly looking at ways we can intensify our intelligence cooperation and further disrupt the flow of foreign fighters. We will work to share with our partners lessons the United States learned following the September 11th terrorist attacks about breaking down information stovepipes and protecting our homeland more effectively.\nThe second thing I wanted to call to your attention -- that many of you have already reported on -- is that, in addition to continuing to meet with senators of both parties, Chief Judge Merrick Garland submitted his questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The questionnaire and associated materials present an exhaustive picture of Judge Garland's distinguished career and impeccable credentials as the nominee to the Supreme Court.\nHe has more -- as you've heard me say on many occasions -- he has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee, and a lengthy record of consensus-building, judicial excellence, public service and academic achievement. His record demonstrates that he's a careful, balanced judge who follows the law. In fact, he's never written an opinion that's been reversed by the Supreme Court. And I think that's indicative of his careful and principled approach to jurisprudence.\nHis opinions reflect his widely recognized ability to forge consensus among his colleagues on a range of challenging subjects, including national security, campaign finance, civil rights, criminal law and federalism. These are the kinds of issues that any judge has to confront when you are serving on the second highest court in the land, like Chief Judge Merrick Garland is. His litigation record reflects a decades' long devotion to public service and an exceptional record of legal achievement, including his role in the Oklahoma City bombing and Unabomber cases.\nWe expect that upon receiving this questionnaire, the Senate Judiciary Committee members will do their jobs by reviewing the information, notice any hearings so that the American people can hear directly from Chief Judge Garland as he answers questions under oath, and then give him a fair yes or no vote. This is the kind of hearing and/or vote that every nominee since 1875 has received, and we expect the Senate will give Chief Judge Garland the same fair consideration as prior nominees.\nSo, with that long windup and two important pieces of business out of the way, Kathleen, why don't you get started with questions?\nQ: I'm actually going to have to start with the President's trip to Hiroshima.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: It seemed like the White House, in addition to announcing the visit, wanted to really stress that the President was not going to apologize in any way for the bombing at Hiroshima. And I'm wondering if you could just articulate a little bit in more detail why it's so important that folks understand that that's not the mission of this trip. What would be so wrong in apologizing, given the devastation and the size of the tragedy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously this is a question that historians have considered and it's an entirely legitimate line of inquiry for historians. The President intends to visit to send a much more forward-looking signal about his ambition for realizing the goals of a planet without nuclear weapons. This also is an opportunity for the visit to highlight the remarkable transformation in the relationship between Japan and the United States.\nIf you would have imagined that one of our closest partners and allies in Asia was Japan, just 70 years ago it would have been very difficult to imagine, given the hostilities between our two countries. But yet, that's exactly what has occurred, based on a commitment of the leaders of our two countries to forge closer bonds. We've also seen deeper ties between our peoples. And even as we speak, there are thousands of U.S. military servicemembers who are stationed in Japan, and they operate in bases in Japan that enhance not just the national security of the United States but also contribute in important ways to the national security of our Japanese allies.\nThe United States and Japan also work effectively together, including through our militaries; on humanitarian relief efforts; on other emergency response efforts, including the natural disaster that the Japanese people suffered as a result of a tsunami and an ensuing crisis at the nuclear facility in Fukushima. All of this is a testament to the way that the U.S.-Japan relationship has dramatically changed over the last 70 years, and the President is certainly interested in further marking the progression of that relationship by visiting Hiroshima.\nQ: But he doesn't need to go to Hiroshima to talk about the partnership between the U.S. and Japan, right? I mean, he has a message specifically about nuclear weapons, I assume, and there are a lot of groups saying that he shouldn't just go there -- he should go with something actually in hand, some new announcement to make.\nMR. EARNEST: There are a lot of people with a lot of opinions about this trip. They're certainly entitled to them. So the President will be traveling to Hiroshima. That visit, of course, will follow visits that were made by both the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and, recently, by Secretary of State John Kerry, who attended a G7 ministerial meeting in Hiroshima. And the President will have an opportunity to visit the Peace Park and offer up his own reflections about his visit to that city.\nThe President certainly does understand that the United States bears a special responsibility. The United States continues to be the only country to have used nuclear weapons, and it means that our country bears a special responsibility to lead the world in an effort to eliminate them. And this is a goal that has been sought by both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and it is a goal that would make our country and our planet safer.\nBut, look, there's also no diminishing the important contribution of the greatest generation of Americans who didn't just save the United States, but, rather, saved the world from tyranny. And the courage and bravery of that generation of Americans is one that will go down in American history. And over the last decade or so, there's been an increasing effort to pay tribute to them as that generation ages and, unfortunately, many of those American heroes have passed on. But I feel confident, and the President is confident that future generations of Americans, long into our history, will recognize a significant debt of gratitude that they owe to those brave Americans that ensured the United States and the defenders of freedom prevailed in the Second World War.\nQ: Okay, thanks. And on another topic, I assume the White House is following some of the discussion about complaints that Facebook has been suppressing conservative voices and viewpoints. And I'm just -- as the White House uses Facebook quite a lot, and the President has spoken out about concerns that people are siloed and get their news from sources that reinforce their own views, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts, or if this is something that the President is concerned about.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the White House certainly does use Facebook to communicate with the American public. I believe the Associated Press uses Facebook to communicate with the American public, as do your media organizations -- or your news organizations.\nWe obviously are all dealing with a rapidly changing news environment, and communicating more effectively with the American people is a responsibility that we all have. Obviously we were pleased to see the statement from Facebook making pretty clear that this was not something that they engaged in. Obviously you can ask them directly for a better explanation of what people may be seeing. But there's no denying that the kind of media environment that exists today places a special burden on consumers of news to make a concerted effort to seek out opinions that may differ from them.\nThe nature of Facebook is that it helps people connect over large distances, and it makes those connections based on shared opinions and shared characteristics. And the media environment, the way that it's structured now certainly makes it easy for any individual to surround themselves with voices and perspectives and opinions that they share.\nAnd the President has given a number of speeches where he's talked about how important it is for citizens across the country to seek out differing opinions, to challenge their own assumptions, and doing so better educates them about important issues and gives them a better perspective about the diversity in our country and will ensure that our government makes better decisions, and that the citizens across the country can inform themselves about the debate, can engage in that debate, and be more effective in pushing our country's leaders to make the decisions that reflect the preferences and priorities of the American people.\nTim.\nQ: I want to talk about the Philippines.\nMR. EARNEST: We can if you'd like to.\nQ: President-elect Duterte -- does the White House have any qualms about his advocacy of hundreds, if not more, vigilante killings to wipe out crime and drug trafficking?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, at this point, the United States is prepared to commend the Philippines on its May 9th elections. By all accounts, those elections appear to have gone smoothly and enjoyed historically high levels of participation. Those are all indications of a vibrant democracy. We're still awaiting the official results from officials in the Philippines, and we look forward to congratulating and working with the winners of those elections on our active and close bilateral relationship.\nTim, I don't think you went on this trip, but obviously the President traveled to the Philippines last November, spent several days there, and had multiple opportunities to underscore the depth of the U.S. relationship with the Philippines. Obviously we've got an important security relationship, and our efforts to coordinate with the Philippines as they provide for some maritime security that has an impact on the economy here in the United States is important.\nWe also value the important economic bilateral relationship between the United States and the Philippines, and the President had an opportunity to discuss those issues with President Aquino when he was in the Philippines last November, like I said. So that's an indication of how healthy the U.S. relationship is with the Philippines. And we look forward to strengthening that relationship and deepening that relationship with whomever the Filipino voters have decided should lead their country moving forward.\nQ: But in the campaign, Duterte was talking about throwing away the human rights laws. Does the White House hear any of the echoes of the past there -- the authoritarian past?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any comments about the campaign platforms or the rhetoric used by any of the individual candidates in the Filipino election. We'll wait for the official results, and we can comment more directly there about our ability to work with the winners of that election.\nQ: And just one more on the Philippines. Duterte has called for multilateral talks to resolve some of the issues in the South China Sea. Is that an option?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't have a specific comment on any of the proposals that have been put forward by the candidates. In general, our approach to the situation in the South China Sea has been that the United States is not a claimant to any of the land features in the South China Sea, but the United States does believe that those who have competing claims should find a way to resolve those differences through diplomacy and through established international procedure. And that continues to be our position, and we certainly encourage all parties in that region of the world to pursue their differences and to resolve their differences in that way. Our interest is in making sure those differences are resolved peacefully in a way that doesn't disrupt the free flow of commerce in the region.\nThis is a region of the world where billions of dollars of commerce is shipped every day, and we certainly are interested in preventing any sort of disruptions that flow of commerce and goods.\nQ: On Zika, Senator Nelson of Florida is saying that he's confident that the $1.9 billion that the administration is pushing for for Zika is going to pass the Senate and not even need -- on an emergency basis, so it wouldn't need any kind of -- need to be offset with any other spending cuts. Does the administration share his confidence in that?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't hear who you said made those comments.\nQ: Bill Nelson.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. We certainly believe that's what Congress should have done at least a month or two ago. This is a public health emergency that our country's leading scientists and public health experts have identified. I began the briefing yesterday by reading a statement from the National Governors Association, representing Democratic and Republican governors across the country, who urged Congress to act quickly to provide resources both to our public health professionals but also to states and localities that are fighting the Zika virus.\nFailing to do so, or delaying action is going to have a negative impact on the public health and well-being of the American people. That's not just a statement that I've made; that's a statement we've heard from Democratic and Republican governors, and it's a statement we've heard from public health professionals.\nSo Congress is past due in making this kind of commitment to America's safety and the public health of the American people. The debate about passing these resources should not get bogged down in a partisan dispute about how it's going to be paid for. This is emergency funding, and Congress should act quickly to pass it so that these resources can be used to start expanding lab capacity so that we can make diagnostic tests more effective; it can certainly ramp up our ability to develop, test and manufacture a vaccine. And I think in the minds of these governors, they're most interested in getting additional resources to help them fight mosquito populations in communities in their states where we're at risk of seeing these mosquitoes actually carry the Zika virus to more people.\nQ: How is the White House reaching out to lawmakers?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've been pretty blunt about what it is that we want both in terms of our public communications and our private communications. I'll just recall, because I carried it out here with me, that the White House did present to Congress on February 22nd of this year a very specific proposal of how much money is required and how that money would be used. But since that time, we have not seen Congress take the necessary steps to act on this specific proposal.\nSo, again, it is unconscionable for Republicans to continue to delay this kind of assistance to states that need it and to public health professionals that are pretty concerned that adequate resources are not being mobilized to confront this serious public health emergency.\nBob.\nQ: Josh, I'm probably way ahead of the game here, but --\nMR. EARNEST: You usually are, Bob. (Laughter.)\nQ: When the President goes to Japan, Prime Minister Abe is probably going to ask him about a potential Donald Trump presidency. And the fact that Trump keeps saying on the campaign trail he's going to rework trade deals with Japan and China -- to the best of my knowledge, the only trade deal we would have with Japan is the one that's coming up, the TPP, if I'm correct. I don't know, but anyway --\nMR. EARNEST: You are correct that Japan is part of the TPP agreement that's been reached.\nQ: But what is he going to say to reassure Abe that the United States will live up to this commitment for this agreement, especially with reluctance on Capitol Hill to even vote for it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Bob, what we do need in order to meet the -- in order to complete this agreement is we do need congressional approval. And the good news about that is we know that there is strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for a trade agreement like this one that would cut taxes that other countries impose on American goods -- 18,000 taxes, in fact. So there are ample reasons for Congress to act to implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\nAnd the President will make clear to Prime Minister Abe that that continues to be a priority of his administration, and he'll reassure him that there continues to be strong support among Democrats and Republicans, not just in Congress, but across the country, for this agreement. That's why you've seen organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau come out and indicate their support for this agreement, because they understand the positive economic impact it would have on the country. And the President certainly intends to work in bipartisan fashion to get this done.\nQ: What about the Trump factor? Has he been asked already about this in other locales -- I mean, directly from Japan, I guess is the best way to put it.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to all of the private conversations that President Obama has had with Prime Minister Abe. But the President has observed that it's not unusual for world leaders to ask him about the state of the American political debate and to ask about particular candidates. I think the President has made his own views pretty clear, and I think what you hear the President say publicly about this is exactly the same thing he says privately to world leaders when they ask him about it.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple questions. I want to go back to your packet or your letter to Congress.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure. We can get you a copy. It doesn't just have to be mine.\nQ: I would love a copy.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. We'll get that done. Let's make a note here, guys. April seems to be showing more interest than Republicans in Congress are on it. (Laughter.) So we certainly want to cultivate that interest and make sure you can take a close look at it.\nQ: So tell me, I just want to know the construct of that letter or that packet of information. Give me the components of that. I just want to know a little bit more about it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, it's long, but what I can tell you is that what it does is, in rather detailed fashion, goes through exactly how much money would be dedicated to the specific efforts to fight the Zika virus. In some cases, it's funding to the CDC. In some cases, it's funding for the NIH. There's also extensive funding that's been requested to help local authorities fight the mosquito populations in their communities.\nWe know that this is a virus that's transmitted by mosquito, and so this is something that, I believe, Dr. Fauci talked about this when he was here, that one of the things that we know would be helpful in fighting the Zika virus is if we know that there's someone in the community that's contracted the Zika virus that there should be a special effort made to try to eradicate the mosquito population around that person's house so that that person is less likely to get bit by a mosquito and have that mosquito transmit the virus to someone else.\nSo having a nimble operation like that requires substantial funding, certainly more funding than is currently available to states and localities for fighting the mosquito population. And this is a common-sense way -- there shouldn't be a partisan difference in fighting mosquitoes. I don't know that Republicans are pro-mosquito. Though if they are, that would make news. But so there's no reason that we shouldn't see bipartisan congressional action on something as common sense as this.\nQ: So how much of that packet or is that letter dedicated to the dangers, the potential pandemic, the reality -- the drastic realities of what could happen? How much of that is --\nMR. EARNEST: There's not an assessment that's included in here in terms of what the longer-term projections are for the spread of the Zika virus. You might check with CDC to see if they have any materials like that. This is really focused on what are the resources that are necessary to ensure that federal, state, and local officials are doing everything possible to try and protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nQ: All right, so not including an assessment -- do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing, especially when you're asking for money, to show that this is such a need?\nMR. EARNEST: There are available assessments. And if there's any doubt on the part of members of Congress about the threat posed by the Zika virus, then I certainly would encourage them to be in touch with the CDC.\nQ: Okay. And on two other subjects -- West Point. Do you have anything new to talk to us about that picture today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, what I can tell you -- I don't know whether or not the President has seen the picture. I've not spoken to him about it. But I can assure you that the President has an enormous amount of pride in the members of the class of 2016 who are set to graduate from all of our service academies, including West Point.\nThose of you who have covered the President for a while will remember that the President has now delivered two commencement addresses at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The President is also looking forward, in a month or so, to delivering the commencement address at the United States Air Force Academy out in Colorado Springs. It will be an opportunity for him to acknowledge the tremendous accomplishments of these fine young Americans who have gone through four years of rigorous academic and military training and have been prepared to lead their fellow servicemembers on the battlefield.\nAnd what is true is this particular photo that's gained a lot of currency online has generated some discussions about race relations in our country. But the real focus should be on the tremendous accomplishments of these cadets and, as I mentioned, the fact that they will soon be leading soldiers on missions around the world.\nQ: Let me ask you this. Thinking about what the President said about heritage and diversity at Howard -- again, that's the most recent piece where he's talked about race -- thinking about what he said and looking at this picture, does this White House feel it possibly is an unnecessary controversy, an unnecessary critique of a picture showing black pride -- as the President had talked about at Howard, knowing who you are?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to try to divine the message that those cadets were attempting to send. What I can tell you is that the President is proud of all of our graduates at our military academies. They've made a significant sacrifice and they've dedicated the early part of their lives as young adults to serving their country -- that's worthy of our respect and our gratitude. And the President is certainly proud of the commitment that they have made to their country and is proud of the way that they have prepared themselves to represent our country, to serve our country, and even defend our country in missions around the world.\nQ: And lastly, Ferguson -- has it come full circle now? There is now a black police chief.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports. Is there a question?\nQ: I said, now has Ferguson come full circle, now that there's a black police chief?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that's a judgment that I would render from here. Obviously the community of Ferguson -- I think all of the residents in that community would acknowledge that the work of strengthening that community and repairing some of the bonds between government and citizens is going to take some time.\nAnd in some ways, that's work that's never done. The sign of a strong community is one that constantly challenges itself to improve and to make sure that the will of the people is manifested in the day-to-day decisions of the government. And I think what is certainly true is that the community of Ferguson has made a lot of important progress. Many concerns and problems that were beneath the surface for a long time did erupt into public view, in tragic and violent ways sometimes.\nBut by confronting these challenges head on and by being committed to repairing that community, that's the path to success and there's no denying that they've made a lot of important progress in that regard.\nQ: Last question on this. Is this a positive step forward -- after the Justice Department has been watching them and working with them to fix many of their problems that's come out in documentation that they have had practices that were discriminatory?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's the people of Ferguson that should sort of render a judgment about how much progress that they've made. But based on the coverage, it does seem like they are beginning to make some important movements in the right direction, and that is a reflection of the advocacy of people in that community, but also a commitment to public service on behalf of some people in that community that have decided to take on a pretty tough assignment, including the new police chief.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two topics. One, does the President want to meet with any of the survivors of the Hiroshima bombing?\nMR. EARNEST: All of the logistics for the President's trip have not been formulated at this point, so I don't know at this point whether or not he will have an opportunity to meet with any of the survivors, but we'll keep you posted on that.\nQ: Okay. And then, John Kerry is in Western Europe. He declared parts of Iran \"open for business.\" He said that\nWestern companies should not use the United States as an excuse for not doing business in Iran. It sounds like you guys are pretty concerned that Western European companies might, in effect, cast a vote of no confidence in the Iran deal. Is that the case? Are you concerned that if not enough economic -- if not enough business is done with Iran that that might lead to some unraveling of the deal? Or Iranian expressions of hostility in some other formats?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I think the first thing it indicates is that the dire warnings of the harshest critics of the deal weren't true. They didn't come to pass. There were suggestions by many Republicans in Congress that Iran was prepared to receive hundreds of billions in sanctions relief as a result of this agreement. And I have stood up here countless times and said that that wasn't true, and tried to explain why. And then this is just the latest evidence that, again, those critics of the deal were either wrong or lying but that hasn't stopped them from continuing to do that.\nMore generally, I can tell you that the goal of the Obama administration and of the Secretary of State is to communicate as clearly as possible with the business community around the world about what is permissible and in compliance with existing sanctions imposed by the United States and the international community against Iran, and what isn't.\nAnd there is an obligation on the part of the government to help people understand how to comply with the sanctions that are currently in place. Sanctions relief has been granted, which means that there are new opportunities, but they are still subject to constraints based on sanctions that continues to be in place against Iran because of their ballistic missile program, because of their continued support for terrorism, because of their violations of human rights and some other things.\nBut what we seek is to be clear as possible about what those sanctions allow and what they prevent, and that's exactly what Secretary Kerry is engaged in over in Europe.\nQ: So in the last couple of weeks, Iran -- we've seen an uptick in anti-American speeches, reports of missile tests, a threat to close the streets of Hormuz. Today, they apparently announced the delivery of S-300 missile defense systems. These are not connected? You're saying that they're actually --\nMR. EARNEST: Those are all things they were doing before the deal. And they're doing them now. So I think it's a little hard to draw a clear connection between those kinds of activities and the deal when they were taking place before the deal and they're taking place after the deal. So we have been quite clear that the goal of this international agreement was to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That was not just a priority that was chosen at random; that was the priority that was identified by President Obama, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and other leaders in the region who were deeply concerned about the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran.\nSo President Obama made a strategic calculation, and said the most important thing we can do when it comes to Iran is to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And he engaged in a concerted strategy to mobilize the international community to achieve that goal. And we have. Iran does not have a nuclear weapon -- that's not based on some sort of intelligence assessment -- that's based on the verification of international inspectors who have checked, and they continue to check on a continuous basis that has made the United States of America safer; that has made Israel safer; that has made our partners in the Middle East safer.\nIt has not resolved all of our concerns with Iran. We continue to be concerned about the way that Iran menaces Israel. We continue to be concerned about the way that Iran supports terrorism. We continue to be concerned about the development of Iran's ballistic missile program. But their ballistic missile program is a whole lot less dangerous when there is no risk of them putting a nuclear weapon on top of one of those ballistic missiles, and that was only possible because of the Iran deal. So we certainly are gratified by what's been accomplished, but our efforts to continue to hold Iran for other aspects of their policies and behavior have not waned.\nIn fact, we have redoubled our efforts to counter Iran's ballistic missile program. There have been new sanctions that have been put in place as a result of more recent activity. We've continued to cultivate our relationship with our partners in the Gulf to enhance their capabilities to protect themselves from Iran's ballistic missile program. We've worked with other people, with other countries, both in the region and around the world, to augment our efforts to prevent Iran from illicitly obtaining materials and equipment that could be used to advance their ballistic missile program.\nSo our efforts here have been comprehensive and the results have been that the United States, our allies, and our partners are safer. Iran is farther away from obtaining a nuclear weapon than they have been before. And the people who complained about the agreement were wrong or lying or both.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, is there a concern that the President going to Hiroshima will be interpreted as an apology?\nMR. EARNEST: If people do interpret it that way, they will be interpreting it wrongly, so I don't think there's much risk of that.\nQ: Was there any debate in the White House about whether the President should go or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there have been questions raised about whether or not the President would travel to Hiroshima every time the President has traveled to Japan. He's done that three or four times now. And on the President's first visit to Japan, back in 2009, he observed that he would like to have the opportunity to visit Hiroshima. And given the progress that we have made to advance nuclear security, given the recent visits of the Ambassador and the Secretary of State, and given the fact that this will be the President's last visit to Japan as President, it seemed appropriate for the President to make this visit.\nQ: On the Garland questionnaire that was submitted, was that something that the Judiciary Committee gave to him, or was that something that the White House had him fill out? And if it was the committee who gave it to him, do you interpret that as a good sign for the nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that he actually filled out the questionnaire that essentially is filled out by federal judges who have been nominated. And when asked about this earlier this year, Senator Grassley said basically -- when asked about whether or not Chief Judge Garland should fill out a questionnaire, or whether or not the Judiciary Committee would be giving him a questionnaire, Senator Grassley said, \"They've got the questionnaire.\"\nSo we filled out the questionnaire that we got, and we submitted it today. And we certainly were pleased to see the Senate Judiciary Committee accept the questionnaire and to post it on the website. That is consistent with the way this process is supposed to work.\nAs I pointed out, the next step in the process here should be members of the committee should carefully consider the contents of the questionnaire and schedule his hearing. We certainly are ready for them to do that.\nQ: Last, I think you mentioned there were -- he had met with 10 Republican senators. Has that changed at all? And is there any hope for meeting with more? Because there are a lot more there who he could meet with. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll point out that there are a lot who have said that they will not meet with him. So let me see if I have the latest tally here in terms of -- he's met with 46 senators, total, including 14 Republican senators. Later today, I can tell you that Chief Judge Garland will be meeting with Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican. He'll also be meeting with Brian Schatz, a Democratic Senator from Hawaii. So that would bring us up to 15 Republican senators after the meeting with Senator Johnson.\nI recognize -- Pam, you're pretty good at math, so you've concluded that that's not even a majority of Republican senators who serve in the Senate. But 15 is notable because you'll remember that the opening bid by Republican senators was issued by the Republican Leader in the Senate, who said that they wouldn't be meeting with the President's nominee, and, in fact, 15 Republican senators at the end of today will have done so.\nQ: I'm not 27, either. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well. (Laughter.)\nRon.\nQ: I'm not 27, either. (Laughter.) Just for the math.\nMR. EARNEST: Not my first day here -- (Laughter.)\nQ: Is there any indication that any of the members of the committee have said that they will consider the content of the questionnaire and that they will schedule a hearing? Is there any -- because it feels, to be quite frank about it, you're talking about a questionnaire being submitted as a positive sign. We did the math about the small number of Republican senators who have actually met with Judge Garland.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's 15 Republican senators who defied their Republican leadership and agreed to meet with him.\nQ: Well, that's one way of looking at it, but it's also the rest who have not defied, and are holding strong to what's clearly been their position from the start -- that they are not going to consider this nomination.\nMR. EARNEST: They're not going to do their job. I recognize that the vast majority of Republican senators have held to the position that they will not do their job.\nQ: I'm not sure where we are now. Months later, do you still believe that Judge Garland is going to have a hearing before President Obama leaves -- before a lame duck session?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. We certainly believe that that's the direction that we're headed, and that is certainly what he deserves. That's the way that it has worked for every single Supreme Court nominee since 1875. I'll point out that there is one new data point, and this is actually -- Senator Flake was on your network over the weekend, and Senator Flake actually took a more forward-leaning position than many of his Republican colleagues.\nHe actually opened the door not just to giving Chief Judge Garland a hearing before the election, not just to giving Chief Judge Garland a vote before the election -- he actually imagined a scenario in which the Senate would confirm Chief Judge Garland before the election. We certainly believe that's what they should do, and we were gratified to see a Republican senator making that case. In fact, this is a Republican senator who serves on the Judiciary Committee.\nQ: So do you think more are going to come forward and make statements like this? Are there indications like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they should.\nQ: They should, but are they? Is there concrete progress underway?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there's concrete progress. They started out with saying that they weren't going to meet with the guy, and now 15 Republican senators say they have. They started out saying that they wouldn't even consider a hearing, and we've seen Senator Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, step forward and say the Senate should \"man up and vote.\" We've seen two former Supreme Court justices come out and say -- this is Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor -- indicate that they believe that the Senate should do their job. We've seen Senator Collins from Maine come out and say that she would welcome the opportunity to participate in a -- to watch a hearing and to cast a vote. And now we've got Senator Flake out here who has gone even farther and said that he can imagine a scenario in which the Senate would confirm him.\nSo all of this in the face of a Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who, just hours after Justice Scalia died, said that the Senate would not do anything to consider the President's nominee and the President shouldn't even bother putting someone forward. Well, the President did do his job. The President nominated somebody that even Republicans acknowledge is a consensus nominee. And some Republicans have continued to block his progress. But we're going to continue to move forward. We're going to continue to do everything that is required and typical of that process, and we'll see if Republicans continue to try to block it.\nQ: They, no doubt, will. When do you expect the hearing would happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, the Senate Judiciary Committee would have to schedule a hearing. The Senate Democrats who serve on that committee laid out the typical schedule for the way that this would have worked if Republicans were doing their job in the Senate, and they said that that hearing would have taken place in the last week in April. We certainly were prepared to participate in the hearing had it been scheduled for them. So Republicans are past due. And we're prepared to participate in the hearing as soon as they can get one on the books.\nQ: And just to follow up on the Iran questions. Essentially what you're saying is that the Iran nuclear deal has made the U.S. and its allies and the world safer.\nMR. EARNEST: Undeniably.\nQ: But is it also clear that you have not seen any progress on any other front where the United States has concerns with Iran in terms of its missile programs, in terms of its involvement in Iraq and Syria, in terms of its support for terrorism and so forth, down the list. I mean, I think that's what you were saying, is that you had to redouble your efforts in these areas. So it would appear that -- not to minimize the nuclear threat -- but it seems also clear that there's no other area where you can point to where there's been progress as a result of renewed communications or establishing communication --\nMR. EARNEST: There was that little thing where we got four American hostages out of Iran. I think that counts for something. We did have some success in resolving this longstanding financial dispute in a way that saved the American taxpayers billions of dollars with Iran. So I don't think either of those are small matters.\nI would acknowledge that we haven't seen Iran stop supporting terrorism. We certainly would welcome them doing that. But their support for terrorism is a whole lot less dangerous if they don't have a nuclear weapon sitting in the closet. The same could be said of their ballistic missile program. We've been concerned that they continue to carry out these tests -- we can't confirm the latest test that may have been conducted -- but those tests are a whole lot less menacing if there's no risk of them putting a nuclear weapon on top of it. The same is true of their support for the Assad regime. That support for the Assad regime is not nearly as dangerous as it would be if there was the potential that they could use a nuclear weapon to protect Bashar al Assad.\nQ: In the context of the nuclear deal, a lot was said about the benefits of diplomacy, of talking and having -- is there any area now where you will clearly identify the administration is involved in some sort of negotiation, active diplomacy, communication with the Iranians where you expect to see some progress on some other front?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the other point of progress that I didn't acknowledge was the rather undramatic release of those American servicemembers who, earlier this year, had been picked up in Iranian waters. That was clearly a testament to the effectiveness of the channel of communication between senior U.S. officials and senior Iranian officials.\nSo those communications channels remain open. And I don't have anything to predict about what sort of announcements may be forthcoming, but even in just the few months of this year, whether it's the successful return of American citizens who've been held unjustly in Iran, or the resolution of those financial disputes, or even the rather drama-free release of those American servicemembers who drifted into Iranian waters -- in each case, the benefits of our improved communication with Iran we're beneficial to the United States of America.\nQ: But in terms of Iraq and Syria, there's been no -- the Iranians are as problematic as they ever were.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the situations in those countries are obviously complicated. And we have not resolved all of our concerns with Iran's behavior in the context of the nuclear agreement, but we have, despite the lies and false predictions of our critics, have succeeded in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and verifying that their nuclear program has been rolled back in ways that enhance the safety and security of the American people.\nMargaret.\nQ: On Iran, you said that your critics went to this wrong assumption that there would be this huge payday for Iran because of the nuclear deal, and implied there that the White House knew better. Does that mean the U.S. knew that Iran actually never would be open for business, given the U.S. financial system?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the United States has done is demonstrated a clear commitment to upholding our end of the deal. We have only been willing to do that after Iran not only lived up to their end of the deal, but allowed the international community to enter their country and verify that they had lived up to their end of the bargain. That included things like disconnecting thousands of centrifuges, shipping out 98 percent of their highly enriched uranium stockpile, essentially rendering harmless their heavy-water plutonium reactor.\nOnce we verified that they had taken all of those steps, then the United States moved forward with implementing our end of the deal. What we indicated is that there would be sanctions relief that Iran would get, and there would be resources that had been withheld from them that they would get access to. The President acknowledged this both before the agreement was completed and also in the statement that he delivered in announcing that the agreement had been reached.\nWhat is false is people like Steve Scalise said that Iran would get \"hundreds of billions of dollars.\" So, again, I don't know if Mr. Scalise is just really poorly informed, or lying, but what he predicted is not true. We said so at the time, and now we can actually evaluate the facts and determine whether or not he was right. Steve Scalise was wrong -- not for the first time.\nQ: But it puts this administration in kind of an awkward position when the Secretary of State has to stand out there and say Iran is open for business, because the U.S. is the reserve currency of the world, because the U.S. has such influence and control over the world economy and the world financial system that, as he's saying, some European institutions blame the U.S. for keeping it out of Iran. Was that something that the White House knew would happen going in, that this was sort of -- even if the sanctions were lifted, that it wasn't Iran being open for business in the sense that money was going to flow in?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think what we knew is that Iran would get access to some of the funds that had been withheld from them because of the sanctions put in place over their nuclear program. The point that I'm making is that the amount of relief that they would get was wildly and falsely overestimated by critics of the deal.\nAnd again, there is a point where -- we had sort of this debate and dispute about how much sanctions relief they would get. People like Steve Scalise, who said that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars, again, were either wrong or lying. Unfortunately, it hasn't really prevented critics from continuing to make that case. I'm not really sure why that is. But I think it is a whole lot more awkward for Steve Scalise to have to face up to the fact that Iran did not get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief than it is for Secretary of State John Kerry to make clear to the international community that the United States is committed to helping people understand exactly what's in compliance with the sanctions we have in place with Iran and what's not.\nQ: You're not concerned about the deal unraveling because of the griping on the part of the Iranians that they're not getting the kind of influx of business that they expected?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: You're not?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: You're not. Another question on Iran. There was a lawsuit filed by one of the four Americans that was released, Amir Hekmati, a former Marine. And he cites in some detail some of the torture that he experienced while in captivity, and torture not just for being an American, but he says he was accused of working for the U.S. government, et cetera. Is there any White House reaction to some of what he detailed?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the documents that he's filed in the context of this court case. Obviously the President was deeply concerned about the well-being of those American citizens who were being wrongly held by Iran, and that's why the President made it such a personal priority to secure their release. And it's why the news of their release was greeted with so much relief by people not just all across this White House, but people all across the country. There was genuine concern that these Americans weren't just being deprived of their ability to spend time with their families, but that they were doing so, they were facing that deprivation in very hostile circumstances. And we were deeply concerned about the safety and health and well-being of these American citizens. That's why we worked so hard to get them out.\nQ: What he describes in the lawsuit is clear violations of the Geneva Convention, clear torture. And also within the suit he's referred to as a hostage. Does the U.S. believe that these Americans, particularly Amir Hekmati, was a hostage, not just a prisoner?\nMR. EARNEST: When I was talking about this earlier I think I inaccurately described them as hostages. Our policy is that they were detainees, that they were unjustly detained by the Iranian government. And we worked very diligently to secure their release because of our concern for their well-being and because of our concern about the conditions in which they were being held. So the President made this a personal priority to secure the release of these detainees.\nQ: Is there any comment on the seeking compensation and seeking some restitution from the Iranian government for what is described as torture?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't looked at the specific documents that he's filed in the court case. So if we have a position on that, I'll make sure we follow up with you.\nLana.\nQ: The Citadel has recently decided that it would be a violation of school policy to allow a Muslim student to wear a hijab. Does the President support the Citadel's decision to deny this religious exemption? And does the administration think more needs to be done to recruit young Muslim Americans to the top military academy for the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not familiar with this specific case, and I'm certainly not familiar with the dress code policy of the Citadel, so I'll defer comment on that. I will say the President has often remarked about the pride he has in the thousands of Muslims who serve the United States in our military. These are men and women who are committed to their faith and committed to the safety and security of the United States of America. These are patriotic Americans who are serving their country. The President is proud of their service, and we all should be.\nQ: But there's no thought on whether or not a hijab should be allowed at U.S. military academies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure of the policies that are in place at the Citadel, and I'm also not aware of the specific policies that are in place at the four service academies. So I just wouldn't weigh in on them because I'm not familiar with those details.\nQ: And back to Merrick Garland. With North Carolina's HB2 possibly ending up in the Supreme Court, does this further fuel the President's belief that we need to get -- or that the administration needs to get Merrick Garland on the Court and appointed as soon as possible? Or does it make no difference to the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President -- this President sort of has the same view that was taken by Republican President Ronald Reagan, who talked about the fact that every day that goes by with a vacancy on the Supreme Court is a day that the American people should be concerned that the Supreme Court doesn't have the full complement of justices to deal with the important issues before them.\nSo the President feels strongly that the Senate has a responsibility to make sure that the Supreme Court has all nine justices that our Framers envisioned. The President has fulfilled his constitutional responsibility to conduct an exhaustive search after consulting with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. The President has chosen someone that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. The President has chosen someone with more experience on the federal bench than any other nominee in Supreme Court history.\nSo it's really unprecedented for somebody with this much experience to be nominated for this position. Unfortunately, what's also unprecedented is the degree to which Republicans are refusing to do their job and refusing to give this Supreme Court nominee a hearing or a vote for the first time since 1875. Since 1875, every Supreme Court nominee has been given a hearing and/or a vote. And it's unprecedented for Republicans to withhold it.\nQ: And yesterday's lawsuits do not raise the stakes at all for the administration in the Supreme Court battle?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what's clear is the Supreme Court is dealing with lots of very important issues that resonate with the American people on a range of matters not just related to social policy, but also matters related to national security and the economy. So there are a range of important issues before the Supreme Court, and I think the American people believe that they are best served by having the full complement of justices up there making these important decisions.\nQ: And one other thing. Yesterday, when asked about if you could categorically state that no senior administration official ever lied publicly about the Iran nuclear deal, you said, \"No, Kevin,\" but the transcript omitted the \"no.\" Did somebody review those transcripts, or are you changing your answer?\nMR. EARNEST: No. If I had changed my answer you'd know about it.\nSuzanne.\nQ: Back to the President's trip to Hiroshima. You said the intention is not to apologize. If anybody interprets it as an apology that would be a misinterpretation. But does the President welcome the renewed debate that the American people are having or will have when he goes to that city whether or not the United States should have dropped the atomic bomb?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't think the President sees any benefit in trying to muzzle debate. It's entirely legitimate for historians to carefully look at the decision -- the fateful decision that President Truman had to make. And President Truman made a decision that he believed was consistent with our national security priorities. He believed that lives on both sides of the conflict could be saved by dropping the bomb. And I'm confident this is a decision that any God-fearing, moral person would agonize over.\nBut President Truman did what Presidents have to do, which is he had to make a tough decision, and he had to make that tough decision when the stakes were high. In some ways, the stakes might not have been -- may never have been higher. And it certainly is appropriate for historians to take a look at that decision, to consider how that decision was made, to evaluate whether or not it was the right one, to consider whether or not there might have been an alternative that would have produced a better result. It's certainly appropriate for historians to examine what are the longer-term consequences of that decision. All of that is an entirely fair discussion for historians and for the American people to consider.\nBut that's not what President Obama will do when he visits Hiroshima. What President Obama will do is make note of the fact that the relationship between the United States and Japan has emerged stronger than anybody could have imagined back in 1945. And it's a remarkable testament to the commitment of two great countries to try to find peace, and to look for opportunities to work together and coordinate their efforts to advance the interests of their people.\nAnd the United States and Japan have been able to do that in remarkable fashion, on a variety of issues -- whether it's the economy, or the recovery from natural disasters, or even countering a country like North Korea that has in the past threatened to use nuclear weapons again.\nSo I think, looking toward the future, with that kind of relationship in mind, is something that I think is worth noting and the President is certainly looking forward to his visit for that reason.\nQ: Is it part of his intention, his intent, the trip -- not just historians but the American people, just regular folks who take a look at that decision and weigh the pros and the cons of whether or not that was appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, that's certainly -- I would anticipate that in the lead-up to the President's trip that all of you will be doing stories about that fateful decision in American history. I think it's certainly -- that's a relevant discussion for our country to have and there's no reason that people should shy away from considering the impact of a decision like that. But, look, when the President goes to the Peace Park in Hiroshima he is just going to offer some short, simple reflections on his visit and that will include an observation about the way that the relationship between the United States and Japan has been transformed.\nQ: Judge Garland -- the progress that you say is being made here -- there are some Republicans who are gaming out the election campaign and are looking at a possible President Trump or President Clinton, and thinking that perhaps Garland as a nominee would be a better option than someone who would be put forth by either one of those presidents. Is that something that is playing into perhaps the softening of Republicans' position? Is that something the administration has heard, or seen, or is aware of?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, just based on all of your reporting and the kinds of conversations that each of you is having with Republican senators, it's clear that they are feeling some pressure. And they recognize that -- let me say it this way. It has been clear from the beginning that Republicans have not been comfortable with the posture of refusing to do their job when it comes to something as important as confirming a nominee to the Supreme Court.\nThat position for Republicans became even more uncomfortable when the President put forward the name of a nominee that even leading Republicans had described as a consensus nominee. Even Republicans have vouched for Chief Judge Garland. Even Republicans who have had the opportunity to meet with him in private have remarked on his character and on his credentials.\nSenator Graham -- Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Chief Judge Garland as a \"well-qualified man.\" He's \"honest and capable, and his reputation is beyond reproach.\" Senator Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, described him as \"very, very smart, very knowledgeable.\" And Senator Flake, who I referenced before, described Chief Judge Garland as \"obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.\" So these are Republicans who are clearly uncomfortable with the idea of failing to live up to their constitutional responsibility. And that discomfort was enhanced when it became clear that they were going to have to consider somebody that they basically are acknowledging should be on the Supreme Court. Somebody who does have the experience and the aptitude and the credentials to serve with distinction on the Supreme Court in a lifetime appointment.\nI recognize that none of these senators would say that Chief Judge Garland was at the top of their list, but they're also hard-pressed to deny him a position because they acknowledge that he is qualified for it. So that, I think, is what has put Republicans in the most difficult position. I'm confident that the politics are a factor here, but what I'm also confident is a factor is the fact that the President has put forward a nominee that even Republicans say is well-qualified for the job.\nQ: Do you see the politics as working in your favor?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's hard to tell exactly what is going on with the politics right now. So I'll let well-paid pundits make those observations and they can sort of game this out. I think what is clear is that even setting aside the politics -- which is what Republicans, frankly, should do -- there is no one who has come forward with a compelling case that somehow Chief Judge Garland does not deserve a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\nZeke.\nQ: -- a couple of candidates most likely national security intelligence briefings. The President began his in 2008 -- in September of 2008 is when he had his first briefing. Is it the President's expectation that that process would begin sooner now, given the emphasis -- the President signed the Presidential Transition Act -- that that process would begin sooner than the fall?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence will sort of make a plan for when to conduct this briefing with the party nominees. I think that he has indicated that the briefing is not likely to occur until after the conventions. I believe that's why President Obama -- or then Senator Obama did not receive his briefing until September of 2008. You'll recall that the conventions in 2008 were much later than they are this year. So I think that's what's driving the timeframe here. But you do make an accurate observation in that the President has made a smooth transition a top priority, and there are already resources that have been dedicated to this effort by the administration and by senior officials here in the White House to ensure that the next President, whomever the American people elect, will be ready to hit the ground running on January 20, 2017.\nQ: There was another discussion last week of the content of that briefing, particularly given one of -- the presumptive nominee on the Republican side. Some were raising questions, can that person be trusted with classified information. Is the President's expectation that both nominees will be presented with at least the same or more information than he was presented with when he was being briefed before the 2008 election?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's assumption is that our professionals in the intelligence community will determine what will be included in the briefing that the candidates are presented. And I believe that Director Clapper has indicated that he expects both candidates to get the same information, but what exactly is included there is something that our intelligence professionals will determine.\nQ: Does that mean there's no -- the President wouldn't insist on the same level of information he was read in on eight years ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, presumably that information would be outdated by about eight years, so I think it's hard to draw a line in terms of what the same information would be. But the President -- again, what Director Clapper has said is that both the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee in 2016 will receive the same briefing. And what is included in that briefing is something that will be determined by our intelligence professionals.\nAndrew.\nQ: I want to go back to Hiroshima. The President is a student of history. He must have studied the historical record from 1945. Would he have made the same decision as Truman?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the President would say is that it's hard to put yourself in that position from the outside. So I think it's hard to probably land on a specific, precise decision.\nLook, I think what the President does appreciate is that President Truman made this decision for the right reasons. President Truman was focused on the national security interests of the United States. President Truman was focused on bringing an end to a terrible war, and President Truman made this decision fully mindful of the likely human toll. And President Truman evaluated this decision carefully and moved forward in the direction that he believed was consistent with our country's national security interests. And I think, given the way the President Truman approached this dilemma and given the outcome, I think it's hard to look back and second-guess him too much.\nQ: -- indicated that the President will use the trip to make the case for a world without killer weapons. But are we right in saying that the President would use nuclear weapons if necessary?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the President has indicated is that we have a nuclear stockpile and it's one that should be maintained both for safety reasons but also for readiness reasons. And the President has also succeeded in reducing that stockpile based on cooperative efforts with the Russians earlier in his presidency.\nBut the President's first job is to protect the safety and well-being of the American people. And the President believes that the best way to do it is to rid the world of necessary weapons.\nQ: And a final question. This year is the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Do you think that there's a need for some kind of reciprocal gesture from the Japanese?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements at this point about any sort of presidential travel, or what the Japanese may do to mark that occasion. Obviously that is a day that continues to live in infamy, as President Roosevelt observed. And I don't have any announcements at this point about how the President will observe the 75 anniversary of the day.\nTolu.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on the Hiroshima visit and the nuclear weapons issue. There have been some critics who have said that -- you've mentioned that the President said that we should maintain our nuclear stockpile. But critics have said that the President has actually been upgrading and refurbishing and modernizing that stockpile in a way that sort of counters his statement that he wants a world without these nuclear weapons. And they've sort of reiterated those comments as this announcement has been made about the Hiroshima visit. I'm wondering what your reaction is to that line of --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would react in a couple of ways. The first is that the President recognizes the special burden that the United States carries because we are the only country to have used nuclear weapons. And that does set the United States apart from others.\nWhat's also true is that this President has worked aggressively to sign agreements with the Russians so that both sides can reduce our nuclear stockpiles. And we've made progress early in the presidency in that regard.\nThis President has also led the international effort to block the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the context of this international deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The President is quite proud of that aspect of his legacy. What's also true is the President has made this issue -- nuclear security -- a top priority. He convened four international summits, most recently this spring here in Washington, where several dozen world leaders attended to focus on the issue of nuclear security.\nMuch of the work to refurbish our nuclear weapons stockpile has been conducted with the goal of ensuring the safety of those nuclear weapons, but also enhancing their readiness. But none of that detracts from the topline goal that the President has set out, which is to rid the world of nuclear weapons.\nAnd while there certainly is a moral dimension to adopting a policy like that, there's also a direct national security dimension to that policy. The President believes that the United States would be safer and the world would be safer if we could rid the world of nuclear weapons. And that is a goal that the President has laid out. It's a goal that previous Democratic and Republican Presidents have also identified. And the President is proud of the progress that we've made in pursuit of that goal. But he acknowledges that we surely have a long, long way to go.\nQ: Just one on the other part of the President's trip. He's going to be going to Vietnam. And there's been some reports that the arms ban against Vietnam may be lifted. I know you were asked about this a couple weeks ago, but I'm wondering if that's under discussion. If there -- there have been a lot of backlash from the Hill, both parties, about that proposal. So I'm wondering if you've reached out to people on the Hill and if you are discussing potentially lifting an arms ban.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly has been a public discussion of this policy and of this issue. I don't have any comments about those public discussions at this point, but we'll keep you posted if anything is going to change.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Did the President speak with the Attorney General following her remarks yesterday? And what was his reaction to her impassioned comments?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the President having an opportunity to speak to the Attorney General yesterday. The President did see her comments. And she was making an announcement about an enforcement action that the Department of Justice has chosen to pursue. That decision about that enforcement action was made independently by Department of Justice. It was not influenced by the White House. But I agree with your observation that she did make a pretty impassioned defense of ensuring that every American has their basic civil and human rights protected.\nAnd that's the kind of passion that has made her not just an effective prosecutor throughout her career, but it has also made her a remarkably effective Attorney General.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about the overtime expansion the President mentioned quite some time ago. And I know that there is a date coming up where it's expected that the Department of Labor may announce an expansion so that people who are making $50,000 and less could then -- up to $50,000 could get more overtime. Is the President prepared to get moving on that? Or make an announcement on that end?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is -- you're right, this is a Department of Labor rule that is currently being vetted by the Office of Management and Budget. I don't have an update for you in terms of the timeline for when a decision could be announced. Obviously, Secretary Perez has spoken to the motivation behind putting forward this rule change. But I don't have any comment on it from here. But OMB may be able to give you a better timeline for the completion of that consideration.\nQ: Just a couple more. Gitmo detainees and a number of potential transfers out of the facility. Can you give me an update on the number that are still there? And if there is going to be an announcement soon of other transfers?\nMR. EARNEST: The number is somewhere around 90 -- it may be in the high 80s at this point. But every time we make a transfer, we publicly announce it. So there have not been any transfers since the last time you and I discussed this.\nQ: Is there any chance to get a number -- a specific number? Because usually when I ask, you'll say around, or sort of, but you're not --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, we can get you --\nQ: Can you get that for me? I appreciate that. And lastly, sort of taking a 30,000-foot view of the President's visit to Hiroshima -- for the people who are not awash in this all the time, what's the message to America, in particular to older Americans, who might view this curiously, to say the least?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the message to them is the President, I think most powerfully, had the opportunity to show his gratitude to the Greatest Generation of Americans at the 70th Anniversary of D-Day just a couple of years ago. And standing there, overlooking that beach in France, the President talked movingly about how that generation of Americans will go down in history for the contribution that they have made not just to our freedom, but to the world's freedom.\nAnd that certainly was true when it came to the battlefields in Europe, but that was surely true in the Pacific theater, as well. And over the course of this trip, the President will certainly keep in mind the significant commitment and sacrifice that was made by millions of Americans to ensure that the freedom of the United States and the freedom of the world would be protected.\nThere are -- when you travel around the world, other countries recognize the tremendous sacrifice that that generation of Americans made. They saved the world. And it certainly is appropriate to consider the policy decisions that were made at that time, but there is no denying and there is no questioning the patriotism, the courage, and the sacrifice that millions of Americans in the Greatest Generation made to protect our freedom.\nGregory, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. I want to go back to the Garland questionnaire. Most of this has already been a matter of public record, but there was one revealing question where he was asked to cite what he believes the 10 most important cases he's decided are. And those cases involved what would usually be considered liberal causes -- human rights, labor rights, environmental protection, open government, free press. There was a criminal case where he ruled in favor of the defendant. What are we to make of this list? And how does the selection of these cases -- again, this isn't his entire record, but these are the cases he believes are most important. How does that make the case to Republicans who may be on the fence that he is a moderate Supreme Court appointee?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, I think I would first observe there are 2,640 merits cases that Chief Judge Merrick Garland has participated in, and he has authored 357 opinions in nearly two decades on the second highest court in the land. So you rightly pointed out that this is just a small sliver of a tremendous body of work that Chief Judge Garland has assembled during his service on the D.C. Circuit. When it comes to the substance of those decisions, and the substance of the opinions that he authored, I think this is exactly why there's a process for the Senate Judiciary Committee to have hearings.\nThe questions that you've raised are entirely appropriate. These are exactly the kinds of questions that Chief Judge Merrick Garland is prepared to answer. He's prepared to answer them under oath, on camera, in public so that everybody can see exactly what kind of judge he is. He is someone who understands that it is his job to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda. And he's demonstrated that over his 19 years on the federal bench -- more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\nAnd I got to tell you, Gregory, I think this is precisely why Republicans are blocking a hearing, because they know exactly what would happen if they were to grant Chief Judge Garland a hearing in the same way that every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has been granted. They know that he would do an incredible job of helping understand his approach to the law. And it would reveal somebody of remarkable intellect and a commitment to fairness that Americans in both parties can appreciate.\nHe would make clear that he is deserving of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. I think that's precisely why Republicans are blocking his ability to participate in the hearing.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:35 P.M.

Brooks, R-IN, and two cosponsors)\n(H.R. 5046 — Rep. Sensenbrenner, R-WI, and 10 cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to addressing the opioid epidemic. While the Administration welcomes Congressional efforts to elevate the importance of combating the epidemic, the Administration is greatly concerned that, without the resources necessary to prevent opioid addiction and increase access to treatment and recovery services, H.R. 4641, H.R. 5046, and related bills that may be considered simultaneously would do little to help the thousands of Americans struggling with addiction.\nEvery day that passes without Congressional action to support the treatment needs of those suffering from opioid use disorder is a missed opportunity to help the many communities facing the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that opioids – a class of drugs that includes prescription opioid pain medications and heroin – were involved in 28,647 deaths in 2014. In addition to high rates of prescription opioid deaths, there have also been alarming increases in deaths from heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for prescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills. Further, four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioid pain medications. These trends will not change by simply authorizing new grant programs, studies and reports. Congressional action is needed to fund the tools communities need to confront this epidemic and accelerate important policies like training health care providers on appropriate opioid prescribing, an essential component of this effort.\nIn February, the Administration submitted a robust proposal to the Congress to provide $1.1 billion in new funding to address this epidemic and expand access to treatment for prescription opioid abuse and heroin use to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek treatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery. This funding also would support the placement of substance use disorder treatment providers in the communities most in need, and would continue to build effective, evidence-based treatment programs. The President's Budget builds on current efforts to expand prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to secure the funding necessary to ensure that opioid use disorder treatment is available for those who seek it.", "timestamp": "2016-05-10", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4641 - To Provide for the Establishment of an Inter-agency Task Force to Review, Modify, and Update Best Practices for Pain Management and Prescribing Pain Medication & H.R. 5046 - Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act of 2016"}

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday backed a California ballot initiative to save state taxpayers from being ripped off by pharmaceutical companies which charge Americans the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n\"While Congress has failed to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, the people of California can by supporting this ballot initiative,\" the Vermont senator said.\nThe California Drug Price Relief Act is supported by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and National Nurses United, both headquartered in Oakland, California. \"Americans living with HIV/AIDS and cancer should not live in fear that they will go bankrupt because of the outrageously high cost of their prescription drugs,\" Sanders said.\nThe proposition would prohibit the state from paying more for a prescription drug than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The nationwide VA health care system negotiates lower prices for pharmaceuticals.\nAs a former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Sanders authored landmark legislation reforming the health care system for veterans. \"We know that the VA pays considerably less than retail prices for prescription drugs. The people of California and all Americans should get the same price,\" Sanders said.\nPrices for prescription medicine in the United States soared last year more than 10 percent - the third consecutive year of double digit price increases. One out of five adults between the ages of 18 and 64 - more than 35 million Americans - cannot afford the medications that their doctors prescribe. \"In the richest country in the history of the world,\" Sanders said, \"that is unacceptable.\"\nThe pharmaceutical industry is bankrolling a campaign to defeat the California initiative. \"It is no surprise that the pharmaceutical industry already has dedicated $50 million to defeat this ballot initiative,\" Sanders said. \"Their greed has no end.\"\nIn Congress, Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland have introduced comprehensive legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Their bills would authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and reduce barriers to the importation of lower-cost drugs from Canada and other countries.\nSanders and Cummings, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, also have spotlighted steep price increases for generic drugs. The increases cost taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion over the last decade, according to a study Sanders and Cummings requested from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. Prices of top-selling generic drugs rose faster than inflation 22 percent of the time over the 10-year period examined by the study.\nSanders was in California this week ahead of the state's June 7 presidential primary election.\nTo read the senator's statement, click here.\nTo read the senator's plan to lower prescription drug prices, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-05-10", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Backs California Initiative to Stop Rx Ripoffs"}

Sanders prevailed with 43 percent to Trump's 41 percent.\nIn Pennsylvania, Sanders had a six-point lead over Trump. She was up only by 1 percent.\nIn Florida, he had a two-point edge compared to her one-point advantage.\nIn each state, more voters have unfavorable opinions of both Clinton and Trump.\nIn yet another state poll, this one in New Hampshire, Sanders trounced Trump 49 percent to 28 percent, a 21-point spread.

West Virginia is a working-class state and many of the people there are hurting. They know, like most Americans, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. They want real change.\n\"With this outcome, we now have won primaries and caucuses in 19 states. We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast. We expect more victories in the weeks to come when voters go to the polls in Kentucky, Oregon, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and the District of Columbia.\n\"We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we're used to that. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began. And after all the votes are cast and counted and this contest moves to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, the delegates will decide which candidate is the strongest nominee to take on Donald Trump in November. All of the evidence indicates that I am that candidate.\n\"As voters in the remaining states and territories make up their minds about the future of the Democratic Party, I believe they deserve a chance to compare my record and Secretary Clinton's record on creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, war and peace, the need for health care for all, breaking up big banks, combating climate change and other critical issues.

Everybody, have a seat. You guys have been through this before. You know what to do. [Laughter] Sit down. So there's an old saying: You can't win all the time. [Laughter] Except, this team seems to consistently want to bust that cliché. Ladies and gentlemen, for the fourth year in a row, give it up for the NCAA Champion UConn Huskies! [Applause]\nAs you might be able to tell, there are some Huskies fans in the house. [Laughter] Almost the entire congressional delegation from Connecticut. Mr. Larry McHugh, chairman of the University of Connecticut Board of Trustees. David Benedict, the University of Connecticut's athletic director.\nWhen I called Coach Geno to congratulate him for winning the title—again—I told him we have his room ready for when he gets here. It's a small room, with a cot. He doesn't get the Lincoln bedroom. But he does seem to spend an awful lot of time here. As it turns out, the Huskies are generous hosts as well. I've got an open invitation to join their Xbox 360 Rock Band group, the Delta Commas. [Laughter] Now, in 9 months, I will have some time on my hands.\nBut congratulations, Coach, on your 11th national championship. What an extraordinary record. He has now broken the record set by the legendary John Wooden for the most championships by a head coach in Division I sports. And this season, the Huskies broke another NCAA record: They won the most consecutive national championships by one team. Coach Auriemma's players will tell you he is one of the foremost experts on tough love. I'm pretty good at that too. You can ask Malia and Sasha. [Laughter] But to an entire generation of athletes and young women, he has been a lifelong teacher and friend. And all of us, even Huskies' rivals, are going to be cheering him on when he takes Team U.S.A. to the women's basketball gold medal in the Olympics this year. [Applause] Bring home the gold!\nThis team has gone undefeated twice in the past 4 years, including this past season. It is a testament not only to Geno, but to the captain of this team and the NCAA Player of the Year, Breanna Stewart. When she was a freshman, Breanna said she came to UConn to win four championships. And I'm sure Coach was thinking, eh, don't put so much pressure on yourself. [Laughter] But if you've got it, if you can back it up, then you're not being cocky, you're just being accurate. [Laughter] And this team embraced her challenge.\nBreanna and her fellow seniors Morgan Tuck and Moriah Jefferson led the team by making sure everybody else knew what was expected of them. Entering the first game of the season, they were 0-0 like everybody else. They were playing on the road, some of their best players had graduated, and expectations were high. But they quickly put any uncertainty to rest, blowing out Ohio State by 44 points. They'd win the rest of their games by an average of almost 40 points. Tough defense won the championship rematch against Notre Dame. Overall toughness won a hostile road game against the second best team in the country, South Carolina, before a sellout crowd of 18,000 fired-up fans. And from then on, they just marched straight to their fourth title.\nBut thanks to Coach Auriemma, this team has never let victory go to their heads. They are academic all-stars. Over half the team has a GPA of a 3.0 or higher. On Sunday, the seniors walked across the stage and received their diploma. And they're community leaders as well. They run a basketball clinic at Halloween for local kids, a food drive leading up to Thanksgiving, a blood drive for the Red Cross. They collect toiletries from their hotel stays throughout the year to donate to families in need. They filmed a video for elementary school students on the importance of being kind to one another. So these young women know what it means to give back to a community that gives them so much.\nI have a feeling this team will be back again. I will not be. I'll be honest, Coach, I'll miss the visits, our annual phone calls. [Laughter] But I just want to say how incredibly proud I am of all that they have achieved. These women have broken so many records. We don't have time to run through all of them, but they—throughout, they've done it with grace and good humor and good sportsmanship and an outlook that serves as an example for young athletes—boys and girls—to look up to. Their triumphs are an example of the ways that sports can bring an incredible sense of competitive fire, but also teamwork and cooperation, discipline and hard work to a young person's life. They are going to continue to be great athletes. They're going to continue to be great role models.\nI told them earlier that one of the things this program has done is that each year, it has set a high bar for excellence, and each year you see the women's game getting better and better and better and giving all the other teams around the country a mark to shoot for. And that is good not just for young women who can see an example of extraordinary athletic accomplishment that they can shoot for, but it's good for the boys too, because maybe the boys get a sense that they can't mess with the girls because the girls know what it means to be great athletes and great competitors.\nSo we could not be prouder of them, couldn't be prouder of the coach, couldn't be prouder of the program. Congratulations national champions, the UConn Huskies.\nHead Coach Geno Auriemma. You know, the first time we came here in 2009, and then we came back, and we all enjoyed it, and we came back—[laughter]—and I remember saying to President Obama, I said, you know, your fourth year is coming up. And I said, I don't know what the future holds. I said, I know we're going to be back. [Laughter]\nThe President. That was true.\nCoach Auriemma. And he said, so am I. [Laughter]\nThe President. That was true too.\nCoach Auriemma. So, taking that, I was hoping that we could get the rest of the NCAA, after 4 years of Stewie and Moriah and Mo, we could just have a vote and see if we could have them for another 4 years. [Laughter] And unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. We've been fortunate to have Tuck and Moriah and Stewie for 4 years, and Briana joined us—Pulido. They've done something that is pretty incredible in the sense that every other player that goes to college for the rest of the time that they play basketball can never beat, can never top what they've done. Somebody can tie them, somebody can do exactly what they've done. But they go to bed at night, every night, knowing that no one in the history of basketball has ever done what they've done, and no one will ever be able to do more than they've done. And that's something that we all can be really proud of.\nThe President. Hey! [Applause]\nCoach Auriemma. The trips down here are memorable because we know that the President is a tremendous basketball fan. He keeps on top of things. He picks us every year in the NCAA tournament. [Laughter]\nThe President. It's really tough. [Laughter] Clairvoyant. [Laughter] Coach Auriemma. And you know—that's the last thing I'll say—you know, what I'm going to miss the most is—I don't know if you've ever gotten a phone call from the President—[laughter]—but my phone rings, and I look at my phone, and there is just, like, lines, and it says \"Unknown Call.\" And I'm like, I'm not answering this. [Laughter] I don't know who it is. So I don't answer. And then, next day—unknown call. I put it away. The third day, it said, you'd better answer this. [Laughter] And I picked it up, and he's on the phone. And I'm going to miss the relationship. I'm going to miss coming down here. I'm going to miss his support that we have.\nBut if you've been paying attention to what's going on in the media these last 6 or 7 months, as time goes by, we're probably going to miss him more than he misses us. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you. That's very nice. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. That's very nice. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. That's very kind. Thank you. I should point out—I don't know if maybe this is a secret—but we couldn't bring it out here. In addition to the traditional jersey and basketball, Coach brought me a rocking chair. [Laughter] Now, I'm not taking this as an insult. I'm assuming it was meant with love. But, Coach, I do want you to know I'm not going out to pasture here.

Ms. Monaco led a U.S. delegation, at the President's direction, to follow up on our joint counterterrorism efforts following the March 22 ISIL terrorist attacks in Brussels. The delegation included John Mulligan, Deputy Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and General Frank Taylor, Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. Discussions with Belgian officials focused on our whole-of-government approach to information sharing and counterterrorism cooperation with our Belgian partners and solidarity with the Belgian people.\nMs. Monaco praised the work of Belgian intelligence and law enforcement services in confronting the threat from ISIL and noted that Belgium is a vital partner in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. Ms. Monaco discussed with Belgian officials our shared efforts to disrupt terrorist plotting against the United States and Europe and to degrade and destroy ISIL. They also discussed a number of ways we can enhance our counterterrorism cooperation in the wake of the March attacks in Brussels, to include intensifying our information sharing and sharing lessons the United States learned following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Ms. Monaco and Belgian officials agreed to advance a foreign terrorist fighter work plan the U.S. Foreign Fighter Surge Team developed with its Belgian counterparts immediately following the attacks, to disrupt the recruitment and flow of foreign terrorist fighters to Syria and Iraq. Ms. Monaco and the delegation also discussed with their Belgian counterparts countering violent extremism (CVE) efforts, to include our continued joint cooperation through the Strong Cities network, which includes Antwerp, to share best practices on counter-radicalization and prevention at the municipal level.\nMs. Monaco and the delegation also met with European Union Counterterrorism Coordinator Giles de Kerchove to discuss how we can support EU efforts to strengthen counterterrorism coordination and information sharing amongst its members. They discussed the importance of quickly and effectively implementing the European Union's directive on passenger name record (PNR) collection and sharing, to bolster the EU's border security and efforts to disrupt foreign fighter flows.", "timestamp": "2016-05-11", "title": "Press Release - Statement by NSC Spokesperson Ned Price on Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa O.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117427", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n*Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:05 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. We have some brief comments before we get to your questions.\nIn response to a specific request that I received yesterday for additional information about the Zika virus, I also have a visual aid. You want to put it up there. You can see --\nQ: Is that for me?\nMR. EARNEST: It's for everybody, but it certainly is responsive to your request.\nEarlier this week, I highlighted the letter from the National Governors Association, urging Congress to work \"as expeditiously as possible\" to ensure that funds are available for states, territories and the public at large to combat the threat of Zika.\nMany of you will recall that the President convened a meeting with some of his national security team and our public health professionals back in January to discuss the potential impact of the Zika virus on the United States. That meeting led the President to note in early February that he intended to forward a formal request to Congress for a specific emergency supplemental legislation that would be focused on fighting the Zika virus.\nA couple weeks later, in mid-February, the administration put forward that specific proposal to Congress. That is now almost three months ago. And even though we had months to get ahead of this emergency, before we start to see direct transmission of Zika by mosquitoes in the United States, Congress has not acted. Congress has basically done nothing to act on this specific request for funding that was put forward by the administration and endorsed by Democratic and Republican governors across the country, and our nation's foremost public health experts.\nAs you can see in the graphic behind me, the time to prepare before Zika begins to spread in the continental United States is rapidly closing. As CDC has said for months, based on historical trends, we expect to see transmission of Zika from mosquitoes inside the United States starting in June or July. This graphic shows the expected abundance of this mosquito and the significant increase in its presence over the summer months.\nAs you can clearly see, the threat from the Zika virus is only increasing. The truth is this is an emergency now, and Congress should treat it that way. We need emergency funding from Congress that allows us to take urgent and immediate steps to limit the impact of the Zika virus.\nWhat this graphic clearly shows is we cannot wait until October for the normal appropriation cycle before we confront this emergency. Action is needed from Congress now to provide necessary funding this year to protect pregnant women and their babies in the United States.\nAs you all are well aware, we've been asking Congress to take action since we submitted an emergency budget request in February, and you have heard from the foremost public health experts in the world about why we need this additional funding and why we need it now. We are working around the clock. These public health professionals are working around the clock. State and local officials are working around the clock to protect the American public. Congress, however, just returned from recess two days ago, and given the threat that this virus poses to American mothers and their babies, Congress should not leave town for another recess before sending a Zika funding bill to the President's desk for his signature.\nAnd I think the map behind me is a graphic illustration of the need for immediate congressional action. It also is an appropriate illustration for why the current approach that's advocated by Republican leaders in Congress is woefully insufficient. Under the Republican plan that Republican leaders have just started to discuss is that they may get around to passing funding and approving funding for the Zika virus in October. Well, as you can see from the map that would be after the peak of the mosquito season. There's a colloquial expression about closing the barn door after the horse has already left. I would be tempted to use that analogy in this situation if the situation weren't so serious.\nSo we need some congressional action. We need a sense of urgency and we need it now.\nSo, with all that, Brad, welcome to the front row. We'll let you get started off with questions here.\nQ: So before we get back to Zika, I wanted to ask about reports of the Islamic State forces advancing on the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra. That seems to put you in an odd position. Are you hoping the Assad regime holds the city?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have the latest battlefield assessment to offer here. As we noted at the time, we obviously were pleased to see ISIL give up Palmyra, and the focus of our efforts has been on degrading and ultimately destroying that terrorist organization. And we welcomed that development, and we certainly do not want to see ISIL expand the territory that they control, and we certainly do not want to see ISIL put at risk once again such a historically and culturally significant city.\nQ: Given the threat of ISIS reconquering the city and gaining what would be a major strategic victory, is this a situation where the U.S. could conceivably coordinate with Russia, which has provided backup to Assad and indirectly to Assad's military?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have talked for quite some time about the efforts that are currently underway to de-conflict our military activities with Russia in the skies over Iraq and in Syria. There have been a number of consultations about that. But those consultations have stopped short of any sort of formal military cooperation, and I don't anticipate that that will change.\nQ: And I just wanted to ask you about Iraq. There have been three car bombings in the last 24 hours or so, over 90 people killed. Daesh is claiming responsibility. Are you worried that Daesh is trying to shape Baghdad again for a possible assault, as we saw about 18 months ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just start by saying that the United States strongly condemns the multiple attacks in and around Baghdad today. Initial estimates project more than 80 Iraqi citizens have been killed in those attacks; many more have been injured. These attacks demonstrate the terrorists carry out these abominable attacks without regard to innocent civilian life and in order to stoke tensions between these communities even further.\nWe reiterate our solidarity with the Iraqi people against the threat from ISIL. ISIL is a common enemy to all Iraqis, Americans, and the 65 nations who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition. By working together, the Iraqi people have made important gains against ISIL since 2014, and every step the United States has taken is to support the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people as they take back their country.\nI think what is clear from this incident is that a lot of innocent people have been killed and injured, and it certainly is consistent with ISIL's strategy of wreaking havoc and sowing chaos and violence and sectarian tension. And in many cases, they do that by killing innocent people, by targeting them specifically. Those tactics are abhorrent. And it is a good illustration of exactly what the United States has rallied behind the United States to defeat.\nQ: And just lastly, are you worried that the Iraqi government's inability to provide security in the capital is going to fuel the political instability that's been going on and which has been hampering critical elements of the anti-ISIL offensive such as the Mosul offensive?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is clear is that the top priority of the Abadi government is the national security of Iraq, and protecting the citizens of Iraq from this sort of violence is the Abadi government's top priority. The administration, the United States government has been of the strongly held view that the Iraqi government is more likely to be successful in securing the country if they can succeed in uniting that country to face down the threat.\nThat's what Prime Minister Abadi has tried to do. He has worked hard across sectarian lines to build diverse support for his government and for the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And that's why the United States has found Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi central government to be effective partners, and it's why we continue to stand with them as they confront this serious threat.\nJeff.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Brazilian senate is likely to suspend President Rousseff today. What are the implications of that likely action for U.S.-Brazil relations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, you heard the President talk about this when he was in Argentina, and our view at this point has not changed. The President noted our confidence in the durability of Brazil's democratic institutions to weather this political turmoil. Brazil has a system of laws, it's a mature democracy and it has an established system for resolving these political conflicts inside their country.\nSo there's no denying that this is a challenging time for the nation of Brazil and for the government officials that are trying to lead that country. Obviously Brazil is under the international spotlight. The attention of the world will be focused on Brazil later this summer when they host the Olympic Games. So Brazil is under some scrutiny and under some pressure, and the United States is going to be there to support our friend and partner as they deal with the significant challenges that they're facing right now.\nBut as it relates to the political situation, we continue to have confidence in the mature, durable, democratic institutions in Brazil to withstand the challenge.\nQ: Does that mean that the U.S. government does not have any concerns about how that process is playing out right now and whether it's legitimate and fair and following the laws that the Brazilian people have supported?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously believe that these democratic institutions were established for a reason, and the rules that guide that democracy should be followed. I'm not going to render a judgment from here about individual claims or actions that have been taken by political leaders in Brazil. Our hope -- and we continue to have confidence that those democratic institution in Brazil can weather the political turmoil that that country is dealing with right now.\nQ: And switching subjects to a domestic one. There's a new poll, Reuters-Ipsos poll, out today which similar to some other ones that have come out recently, showing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a neck-for-neck race in the general election. Is the fact that that general election is tightening -- even though polls are very early and there's not a Democratic nominee yet -- a concern to this White House, considering the fact that the President has said repeatedly he'd like to see a Democrat succeed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are going to be a lot of polls that are conducted between now and then, and that's an entirely legitimate endeavor. And sometimes they can provide a valuable snapshot of the mood of the country and the preferences of the country's voters.\nThe President has had ample opportunities already this year to talk about how important this upcoming election is because of the -- in fact, that election is so important that the President expects, over the course of the summer and certainly into the fall, to be dedicating a significant portion of his time to engaging in the debate around the election. And the President does have a strong desire to be succeeded by someone who is committed to building on all of the important progress that we've made over the last seven or eight years. And that I think will be the nature of the President's involvement and the argument that he hopes to make.\nQ: Are you concerned, though, about polls showing such a tight race right now between the Democrat and Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would say is there are some polls that have been released that show that the general election is not particularly close right now and there are others that have been released that indicate a closer race. The President's approach to this election will be the same regardless of how close the polls indicate that the race is.\nThe stakes are too high to take this election lightly. Hosting a presidential election every four years means that the American people have an opportunity to weigh in on who is going to lead the country and who, in fact, is going to lead the free world. So the stakes of this election are high. The President believes that the outcome is critically important. And regardless of what predictions are made about the outcome at this point, the President will be fully engaged in making an argument about having a successor that's committed to building on the progress that we've made over the last seven or eight years.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Lawmakers in the House missed the self-imposed deadline today to release their Puerto Rico legislation. And I'm wondering how concerned the White House is about this latest delay, whether you believe it's just a temporary hiccup in getting legislation out.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I do know is I do know that Democrats and Republicans in the House continue to try to work through the differences that have emerged as they've tried to put this legislation together. We have worked to try to nurture that bipartisan effort. There are experts in the U.S. government, particularly at the Treasury Department, that have offered technical assistance to those who are drafting the bills.\nOur position on this has been clear from the beginning. It was back in October that we put forward our proposed legislative solution, and the view of the administration is that Congress needs to provide Puerto Rico with an orderly restructuring regime that would give the Puerto Rican government the kind of authority that *states all across the country -- cities and states all across the country already have. And that restructuring authority would allow Puerto Rico to deal with the financial challenges that they're facing right now.\nWe also believe that in exchange for that authority, the Puerto Rican government should commit to implementing some economic and financial reforms that would be good for the long-term health of the Puerto Rican economy. And we believe that there should be some accountability associated with the implementation of those reforms. And there are a number of proposals for essentially independent oversight that could be provided to ensure that Puerto Rico follows through on the reforms.\nThere's some other proposals that we have looked favorably upon that would do things like reform Puerto Rico's Medicaid program and extend the earned income tax credit to taxpayers in Puerto Rico. This would have a positive economic benefit for Puerto Rico which would have a corresponding positive impact on the quality of life on the island and a positive impact on the island's fiscal picture.\nBut right now, you have 3 million Americans -- more than 3 million Americans who are living on an island that is facing some austere challenges that are already having a real-world impact on the lives of the Americans there.\nSecretary of Treasury Jack Lew visited Puerto Rico earlier this week and saw firsthand some of these challenges. I was actually in a meeting where he was talking about this today. He talked about the fact that he visited hospitals in Puerto Rico -- at least one hospital where doctors were challenged to acquire medicine that could be used to treat pediatric cancer patients, and the challenge that they have is that they basically have to pay for medicine COD. They've got to provide cash on delivery for that medicine. So it's not a simple -- and they have to do that basically every day. That means that a doctor's ability to provide lifesaving medicine to kids in Puerto Rico is affected by the weakening confidence in the Puerto Rican government's ability to pay their bills.\nSo there are human costs here. And these are American citizens that we're talking about. So it's easy to get lost in an esoteric debate about which bond holder is going to get paid first and how much they're going to get paid. But the truth is, resolving these challenges and resolving them soon is going to have an impact on the lives of innocent Americans in Puerto Rico.\nQ: But just to be clear, the latest delay that crept up today, does the White House view that more as, I guess, procedural snafu, like how you termed it during our conversations about TPA, or is this a broader conflict that you're concerned that is not going to be able to be resolved?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I'd go back to where I started, which is that there are still Democrats and Republicans on the committee in the House that are working in good faith to try to produce a piece of bipartisan legislation that would address the concerns that I laid out. So we've got confidence in that process. We're going to continue to support and try to nurture that process to yield a piece of legislation that would address the many challenges facing Puerto Rico.\nAnd we're hopeful -- look, there's no denying that Congress is late to the game here, and there has been some -- there's has been an unhelpful effort on the part of some Republicans to gum up the works here, including by lobbing false charges, suggesting that somehow this is a bailout of Puerto Rico. It's not. And the irony is, is that the more success that those Republicans have in gumming up the works the more likely it is that the only alternative for dealing with Puerto Rico will be a bailout. And that's something that we all want to avoid. And that's why we have been urging Congress to act in bipartisan fashion to pass this bill.\nSuzanne.\nQ: If I could follow up with Puerto Rico. Does the administration have a forecast if it doesn't meet its July deadline in making the $2 billion payment?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure that there have been a number of forecasts that have been conducted. I haven't seen one that we've made public. But you can check with the Treasury Department about that.\nQ: Can you talk more broadly about the situation in Puerto Rico in terms of how it's impacting education, health care, and also fighting the Zika virus? I understand there have been more than 600 cases there already.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department again because Secretary Lew was just there on Monday and he saw a bunch of these negative impacts firsthand. And I just relayed the example of him visiting a hospital there. That obviously is a pretty graphic illustration of the challenges that Puerto Rico is facing as a result of these budgetary problems. And I think they are a good illustration of why Congress needs to act as soon as possible so that we can get to work fixing these problems.\nI haven't seen the latest tally in terms of the number of Zika cases that have been identified in Puerto Rico. But obviously Puerto Rico is under great financial strain. Obviously that financial strain is having an impact on their ability to invest in their public health system. And given the threat that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, now seems like a bad time for investments in public health to be undermined. In fact, this is actually a time when we should be redoubling our efforts to make sure that we can address cases of the Zika virus quickly and try to prevent it from spreading.\nQ: Have you seen any impact in New York or Florida regarding the financial hardship of Puerto Rico?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I mean, I think what we have seen is we certainly have seen an increase in the number of people who are leaving Puerto Rico. I think that is a testament to the difficult economic challenges that are facing the island, and those are not at all unrelated to the budgetary challenges that are facing the government.\nSo I can't speak to any of the specific, tangible impact that we've seen in any of those two states, but obviously there are a host of concerns that have been raised and that have been exacerbated by Congress's failure to act promptly here. So we know what needs to be done. The administration put forward a proposal back in October, laying out exactly how we could address these challenges.\nSo, fortunately, there does seem to be a tenacious bipartisan effort underway to try to resolve those differences. I say \"tenacious\" because we've been talking about this for a long time, but we haven't actually seen any action, but hopefully Democrats and Republicans will both continue to stay engaged in this effort because there's a real human toll here that's already being taken as a result of these financial challenges.\nQ: Hi, Josh. The President has refrained from weighing in the Democratic primary, but the Vice President hasn't done the same. This morning he told Good Morning America that he thought Hillary Clinton would become the nominee and would go on to win the presidency. Did he consult with the White House before making his public preferences known?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- again, I had a chance to take a look at the transcript. You'd have to ask the Vice President's office -- I don't think that he was doing much more than just making an observation about the math of the race, particularly as it relates to the delegate count. You'd have to ask his office if he intended that as him putting forward his own endorsement in the race.\nQ: Does the White House feel like it is an appropriate time to now make endorsements with the delegate map being what it is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have anything to say about President Obama's plans to weigh in on the race at this point.\nQ: Okay. And on Zika, obviously the White House is concerned that Congress isn't doing enough to protect Americans. Is there a concern that Brazil isn't doing enough to protect Americans that may be going to the Olympics, with the continuing problems that we're already starting to discuss in Brazil?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that the Zika virus is much more widespread in Brazil than it is in the United States. And we have offered our assistance and support to Brazilian authorities as they try to contain this threat. And they obviously are working very hard to ensure that all of the world-class athletes that will be descending upon Brazil can do so safely. And we obviously would be supportive of any effort that they would undertake to ensure the safety of those who are participating in the games.\nQ: Has the President or any member of the First Family decided if they'd be attending the games?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, we haven't made a decision about the President's summer travel yet.\nQ: Okay. One last thing on Zika. Senator Flake was saying that $35 million in taxpayer-funded studies could have been better spent on things like Zika. He points to drunk birds slurring when they sing, some people seeing Jesus's face on toast, and honeybees on cocaine. Does the White House have any comments in response to Senator Flake?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I think it's pretty pathetic when we're facing a significant public health crisis, as described by our public health experts, that you would see someone try to distract from what is a pretty important issue. I've had an opportunity to meet Senator Flake on a couple of occasions. He's an honorable guy and he certainly is the kind of person that we would rely on to show some bipartisan leadership, respond to the requests of Democratic and Republican governors, respond to the request of public health professionals, and advance the $1.9 billion in funding that is needed to confront the Zika virus and do everything we possibly can to protect the American people. So I'll leave it at that.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple different subjects. First, I want to stay with Zika. The World Health Organization says it's just as important as Ebola. What does this White House feel about that? They are calling it a possible pandemic.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've gone to great lengths to help people understand the difference between the Zika virus and the Ebola virus. Obviously the --\nQ: The level of concern is such that it's like Ebola. That's what they're saying.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the viruses are different; the impact that they have on people are different. But given the significant risk that we know the Zika virus poses to pregnant women and their babies, we believe that urgent action is necessary to do everything we can to try to protect the American people, especially pregnant women and their babies.\nSo there's no reason this has to be a partisan exercise. This should be a common-sense responsibility that Republicans in Congress should embrace. They ran for Congress so that they could help run the country. Running the country means your top priority should be protecting the American people. This is something that Congress can and should do to protect the American people. They're about three months late in doing it, but they need to put a bill on the President's desk before they leave for yet another recess on Memorial Day.\nQ: And the next question on Zika -- where does this administration weigh in on the issues being discussed between health officials about the fact that Zika is such a threat that people, families, may want to delay pregnancies? Where does the White House weigh in on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we would weigh in on this by saying that people should consult their doctors and that the kinds of decisions that families are making about either starting or growing their family are decisions that they should make within their family and with the best medical advice that they can get from their doctors.\nObviously the CDC and the NIH have shared medical information about the risks posed by Zika to pregnant women with doctors all across the country. We have tried to do as much as we possibly can to educate people about what exactly those risks are. And I certainly would encourage people who are thinking about becoming pregnant to consult the CDC website, to consult their doctor, and understand exactly what the risks are as they make that decision.\nQ: So listening to the doctors debate back and forth about it -- does the White House view it as an ethical issue not to weigh into that debate? Because you're telling people what to do -- women or husbands, wives, or whomever -- about planning a family -- as this is as serious -- as you're saying, possible birth defects for those who are pregnant, for their children.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think our desire is for people to have access to the best medical information possible as they make these intensely personal decisions. Obviously the government is not going to be making decisions for people, particularly when it comes to something as personal as starting or growing your family. But we do want people to have access to the best information they can get as they make that important and very personal decision.\nQ: And on two other subjects. Any word from the President, particularly as he drank the water three times in Flint -- does he have any comment about this lawsuit, about the mayor diverting funds in Flint?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any comment to share from the President about ongoing litigation. The President did have an opportunity when he was in Flint to see firsthand the impact this crisis has had on that community. The President has made clear he's going to mobilize resources from federal government to help that local community. And that's why you've seen millions of dollars in public health grants go to Flint to help doctors and nurses and other public health workers there deal with the medical fallout of that crisis situation. The President has urged Congress to act on funding so that the state of Michigan and the city of Flint can make the necessary infrastructure investments to protect the people in that community.\nBut, look, the city of Flint and the people who live there are enduring a significant challenge, and the President's visit there last week was an important sign to them that the U.S. President has the back of the people in that community that are working hard to rebuild that community and ensure that their children can dream as big as ever.\nQ: And last question -- West Point cadets were clear. Did the President see the picture? Did he weigh in? Did you talk to him about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to him about the picture, but I did see the news reports about the decision that was made by officials at West Point.\nQ: So speaking for the White House --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that the President would not second-guess a decision that was made by those who are responsible for discipline at West Point.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, given what a deadly it was in Baghdad, are there any plans for the President or perhaps the Vice President to reach out to the Abadi leadership?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any calls to announce at this point. But, typically, when either the President or the Vice President is in touch with Prime Minister Abadi, we read out the call after it's taken place, and I'm sure we'll do that in this case, as well.\nQ: Given not just today's violence, but the political crisis that's ongoing in Baghdad, I mean, does the White House still believe that Abadi is strong, as the Secretary of Defense described him just a week ago?\nMR. EARNEST: The administration is still committed -- the U.S. government is still committed to supporting Prime Minister Abadi's efforts to reform the political system and to govern that country in an inclusive way. That's going to be critical to the ability of Iraq to secure their country and to face down the threat that is posed by ISIL. That is the approach that Prime Minister Abadi has pursued, even under unquestionably challenging circumstances. And the United States will continue to strongly support Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi people as they work to unite their country to face down that threat from ISIL.\nQ: But do you believe a political crisis -- I'm sorry, does the White House believe that a political crisis is adding to this insecurity that we're seeing on the streets of Baghdad?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's no denying that what we see is a chaotic situation in Iraq. I suspect that the direction of influence, though, is a little more along the lines of what Brad laid out, which is that the instability around the security situation in Iraq is making governing that country more challenging. And those are the challenging circumstances I was referring to in terms of Prime Minister Abadi's tenure as Prime Minister. So that certainly is why the United States has been so invested -- along with our coalition partners -- in trying to stabilize the -- trying to help the Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces stabilize the situation inside of Iraq.\nThere's a lot of important progress that we've made over the last almost two years now in driving ISIL out of significant populated areas that they used to control, but there obviously is a lot more work to be done. And there was a reference earlier to the effort to drive ISIL out of Mosul, and that will be a tall order. But the United States and our coalition partners have worked effectively with Iraqi security forces to begin the effort to shape that military strategy. And we're going to continue to support Prime Minister Abadi as he pursues a governing agenda that reflects the diversity of the nation of Iraq.\nQ: I imagine some of this came out during the NSC meeting yesterday. The government spokesperson in Baghdad today said that just 14 percent of territory in Iraq is still under the control of ISIS. Do those numbers sound right to you?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that specific statistic. I would encourage you to check with the Department of Defense to try to confirm it. The statistic that we've used comes at it from a different perspective. What we have said is that our coalition, working closely with Iraqi security forces, has driven ISIL out of about 40 percent of the populated territory that ISIL previously controlled.\nWhat that says in terms of the overall percentage of the country, I haven't seen a statistic along those lines, so I'd encourage you to check with either the State Department or the Department of the Defense to try to confirm that specific statement. But I think the statistic that we have confirmed I think does illustrate the important progress against ISIL that's been made. That progress was only possible because of the willingness and courage of Iraqi forces that were willing to fight for their country.\nAnd the weakness that we saw in the Iraqi security forces, back in the summer of 2014, was a symptom of a lack of a willingness to fight for the entire country. There is a part of those Iraqi forces that, based on sectarian considerations, left them less willing to defend certain parts of their country. And working to pursue a governing agenda, working to diversify Iraq's security forces and to bring them under the command and control of the Iraqi central government -- all those are positive steps and all of those have contributed to the progress that we've against ISIL thus far. And it's a testament to Prime Minister Abadi's leadership that he was able to do that -- again, under some very difficult and challenging circumstances.\nBut, look, it's also understandable that there would be some impatience on the part of the Iraqi people and other figures in the Iraqi government about the security situation there. But Prime Minister Abadi has clearly made this a priority. And the American government and the United States military and the 65 nations who are part of our coalition have been strongly supportive of Prime Minister Abadi's efforts and pleased with the important progress that's been made over the last year and a half or so.\nQ: Quickly, on Syrian refugees. Does the President get updates on the numbers of refugees that are being processed into the U.S.? And do you still believe that 10,000 is roughly the number that are going to be taken in this year?\nMR. EARNEST: The President does receive periodic updates about the progress that's being made to accomplish the goal that he laid out, I believe at the end of last year, to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees during this fiscal year. There are reports indicating that we've got some work to do to meet that goal. The President has made clear, both publicly and privately, that this is a priority. And the national security officials that are responsible for implementing this progress understand exactly what the Commander-in-Chief's priorities are.\nThe President acknowledged at the beginning that this would be a challenging goal to meet, in part because individuals who enter the United States through the refugee program are subjected to more background checks and screening than anybody else who enters the United States. And the President was clear that we would meet this goal without cutting any corners when it comes to security. So I think that sort of describes the nature of the challenge facing those who are implementing this program. But the President is serious about meeting this goal, and there's a lot of work to do to make that a reality.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Interesting piece by David Ignatius in the Post, quoting Director Clapper, who said, among other things, about the battle to retake Mosul -- you admitted it's a tall order -- he said he didn't think it could be accomplished within the time frame under this administration. How much of a surprise is that to you? And is that something that the President anticipated?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when the President has talked about this, the President has been focused on the kind of shaping operations that I described earlier. And the goal that we've laid out is to try and put in place the conditions by the end of the year where Mosul could be retaken. So that is the goal that we're aiming for. Obviously, all of this work is being led by the Iraqi central government and the Iraqi security forces, but the United States and the rest of the international community has bought in on this strategy, and the groundwork is being laid even as we speak. But this is a tall order. This is the second-largest city in Iraq. So this is going to be a big challenge, but it obviously would be, and will be, a significant strategic accomplishment once that city has been retaken.\nQ: He went on to say that he didn't think that the U.S. could fix it -- talking about the grander problems that are prevalent not just on the ground, but systematic problems that are there. What does the President think of that perspective?\nMR. EARNEST: The President agrees wholeheartedly. This is a problem that the Iraqi people are going to have to solve when it comes to addressing the challenges in their own country. We've tried the path of the United States trying to impose a solution on these countries that are facing so much turmoil and violence, and that didn't work out very well. It didn't work out very well for the United States; it didn't work out very well for the Iraqi people, either. So we need to pursue a strategy where we are empowering the Iraqi government, the Iraqi security forces, and the Iraqi people to confront successfully the problems that are plaguing their own nation.\nQ: And the President then, you would say, also agrees with his assessment that we should be there because leaving would create a problem as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes that, at this point in time, we should be actively supporting the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to unite his country to face down the threat from ISIL. We cannot afford to take the risk of allowing ISIL to fill a security vacuum. We know that that would have a direct and negative impact on the United States' national security.\nSo we take this quite seriously, and I think it would explain why the President has ordered more than 12,000 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria. It's why the President has given his military orders to implement a strategy to build up the capacity of Iraqi security forces to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. It's also why we've pursued the other elements of our strategy to shut down ISIL's financing and stop the flow of foreign fighters, all in an effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, because we know that the consequences of allowing ISIL to establish a safe haven inside of Iraq would be dire, both for the United States but for our partners and allies around the world.\nQ: And based on that, should the American people receive that as a message that it's going as expected?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the American people can be confident that the Commander-in-Chief understands what's necessary to protect the American people. They can also be confident that President Obama understands that getting the United States directly involved on the frontlines of a ground war in the Middle East where the United States has committed tens of thousands of ground troops in a combat operation would be a bad idea and contrary to our interests. This President --\nQ: I wasn't clear. I meant based on what you were saying -- some of the things you just pointed had successes. Should the American people then take from that the President feels like it's going as it should be?\nMR. EARNEST: I think people can be confident that the President recognizes the stakes; that people can be confident that the President believes that we've made important progress, but I think we can also be confident, and the American people can be confident, that what the President expects to do is to continue this progress through the eight months that are remaining, and present the next President with a path toward accomplishing this broader goal.\nBut it's going to require the United States to continue to support the Abadi-led government that's committed to an inclusive agenda, and it's also going to require continuing to engage the rest of the international community in this effort. This is not something that the United States can or will do alone, but we will play a leading role in leading an international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And under President Obama's leadership, that's exactly what we've done.\nQ: Last one. Would the President consider backing an idea of partitioning the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are obviously people that have floated this idea in a variety of contexts, including even the Vice President in his presidential campaign eight years ago. What our policy and our belief continues to be is that Iraq will be most successful in their fight against ISIL if they can succeed in uniting that country to face down the security threat that ISIL poses.\nWe believe that Iraq is stronger when it's united. And I think the best evidence that we have of this is that President Abadi's predecessor, Prime Minister Maliki, did pursue a rather sectarian governing agenda, and the vulnerabilities in that agenda were laid bare when you saw Iraqi security forces that were charged with protecting that country essentially melt away when ISIL began their initial assault on their country.\nSo that's why the President essentially made a precondition of robust U.S. military involvement in the counter-ISIL effort in Iraq that the Iraqi people elect and support a Prime Minister who's committed to reforming the government in pursuing the kind of inclusive governing agenda that would unite the country to face the threat. That's exactly what Prime Minister Abadi has done. That's why the U.S. government has been supportive of his efforts to do so. And that's why we continue to stand with the Iraqi people in this very difficult time.\nRon.\nQ: A couple of quick ones. Zika -- there was money taken from the emergency fund, right -- the Ebola fund? What is the status of that? And is it your position that that money is going to run out soon and that there is no other opportunity to tap into that same fund if Congress doesn't come up with something?\nMR. EARNEST: Our posture on this has been that using that money was essentially a last resort to try and do as much as we possibly can to protect the American people from the Zika virus. But what our public health professionals have said, what Dr. Fauci said when he was standing at this podium about a month or so ago is that that money, about $600 million, was insufficient to fund all of the things that the federal government can and should be doing to try to prepare for the onset of the Zika virus.\nQ: So there's no more money in that fund? There's no more money available from that emergency fund to the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we can check with OMB on this. I think what it actually is, is that we have basically taken as much money as we can from those accounts without undermining the important public health work that they're already doing. We didn't want to be in a situation where we were essentially eliminating all of the funding to fight Ebola to try to come back and fight Zika, because that would be a pretty unwise decision, as well.\nSo what we've done is basically taken as much money as we possibly can without totally gutting the Ebola program to direct it towards Zika. Now, to succeed against Ebola, we're going to need that money to be repaid, and to be repaid quickly. So we need Congress to act on that, as well. I don't want them to think that this is money that was just sitting around with nothing to do. The fact is, this is money that was available that we could use toward Zika without undermining the Ebola effort, but we need the Ebola effort to be fully funded, as well. And I think everybody who covered this White House in the fall of 2014 would acknowledge that we're not going to take Ebola lightly and that that would be a bad decision for the country.\nQ: In Iraq, following the breach of the Green Zone, is the -- what has been done by the United States to make sure that -- and are you confident that that will not happen again? There were reports that Iraqi security forces basically let these protesters in. There was some concern about the American embassy and that -- there's been more Marines sent in. What is the administration's level of concern about that embassy, and who is responsible for that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the nation of Iraq has obligations to protect all of the diplomatic facilities on their soil, and we've received assurances from the Iraqi government that they understand that that's their obligation.\nIn addition to that, the State Department has ordered some steps to ensure that the embassy -- the U.S. embassy in Baghdad is secure. I think for obvious reasons I won't be able to detail all of the security precautions that have been taken, but the safety and security of our diplomats serving the United States around the world is the President's top priority. And he has made clear to his team that all the necessary steps that need to be taken to ensure their safety at the embassy in Baghdad are taken. And I'm confident that the State Department has done that.\nQ: And given the continued violence there, and the concern obviously about embassies everywhere in light of the Benghazi situation and because that's become such a political issue, the administration is confident that that embassy -- that leaving the primary responsibility to the Iraqis is sufficient?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, every nation has an obligation to safeguard the diplomatic facilities that are on their country's soil. The United States, for example, has an obligation to ensure the safety and security of foreign diplomats that are serving here in the United States. We take that obligation seriously, and we obviously expect that other countries around the world take that obligation seriously.\nBut, of course, at U.S. diplomatic facilities all around the world there are United States Marine Corps servicemembers who are standing guard. And the President takes that security quite seriously, but that certainly does not absolve local governments of the responsibility that they have to ensure the safety and security of our diplomats as well.\nQ: One more. On this issue of the President and the press that's been out there lately -- I sent you this this earlier -- the American Presidency Project in Santa Barbara -- UC Santa Barbara -- did an analysis that shows that President Obama has had fewer press conferences -- is on pace to have fewer press conferences than his previous two predecessors. And the monthly and average rate that he's been doing these at is less than his three previous predecessors. Is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a lot of different ways to slice and dice these numbers. Obviously the President was just out here five days ago doing a news conference with all of you, standing at this podium. So he does them with some regularity. But there are a lot of different ways to slice and dice the numbers here.\nQ: But they counted press conferences -- formal press conferences, briefing room appearances, joint press conferences with other world leaders. I believe it's a fairly credible institution. But the point is that, by a couple of different measurements, the President has been much less accessible -- less accessible -- I don't want to put an adjective in there -- to the press than his previous predecessors. And, of course, there is still time to go. But you don't see it that way or he doesn't see it that way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has done a lot of news conferences. It certainly is your job as you sit here in the briefing room and as you cover the President every day to advocate for more access to the President and for more news conferences and more opportunities to ask him questions. We certainly understand that's a part of your job and that's part of the give and take that has characterized the relationship between the White House and White House press corps for at least one century, probably two.\nI think what is also true is that this President has done more one-on-one interviews with reporters, both from the White House and from other places, than any of his predecessors. I think that is a testament to the President's desire to try to engage with independent professional journalists who are interested in understanding exactly what he's doing.\nBut, look, I don't take any exception to your advocacy for more access to the President. That certainly is part of your job description.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, is there any White House response to the growing complaints about the TSA and the long lines at airport security checkpoints lately, with the summer travel season nearing?\nMr. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific White House order that's been issued on this. I do know that the TSA certainly takes very seriously the responsibility that they have to protect our aviation system, but also to minimize the inconvenience to U.S. travelers.\nSo they're mindful of the responsibility that they have. Certainly some of the challenges that they're facing right now could be alleviated if they got all of the funding that we would like to see them have. So once again, a problem that people have noticed can be traced back pretty directly to the inability of Republicans in Congress to govern the country. But what I also know that the TSA has done is they've brought on some additional staff, including those with some management expertise, to try to address some of these problems, given the resource constraints that they're operating under.\nQ: I also wanted to ask about the national mammal bill that the President signed on Monday. Were there any White House deliberations on honoring the North American bison among all other mammals, including people, I guess? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I can tell you -- that's an interesting question. Well, I can tell you that there was a robust legislative effort on the part of the White House on this one. We were determined not to get buffaloed on this. (Laughter.)\nQ: I did not set him up. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: But obviously, this is a piece of legislation that's passed through the Congress and I would anticipate that the President will sign it.\nQ: I also wondered if you saw that New York Times story yesterday about Mrs. Clinton promising to get to the bottom of the UFO and Area 51 conspiracies. And I wondered if the President would like to beat her to the punch by showing his degree of transparency on this issue, which is of concern to a lot of Americans.\nMR. EARNEST: I have to admit, I don't have a tab in my briefing book for Area 51 today.\nQ: Or a joke.\nMR. EARNEST: Or a joke.\nQ: Because it's (inaudible).\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe it has -- part of a grand conspiracy. I'm not aware of any plans that the President has to make public any information about this.\nQ: Does he feel he's gotten to the bottom of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that he has joked publicly before about one of the benefits of the presidency is having access to that information. I don't know whether or not he has availed himself of that opportunity. But if we have more on this, we'll let you know.\nQ: At night, under the cover of darkness? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Potentially.\nScott.\nQ: Is the President's meeting with the Secretary of Treasury this afternoon mostly about Puerto Rico, or could you give us a little insight on what they're talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is just part of the regular -- I believe it's a bi-weekly meeting that the President has with the Secretary of the Treasury. I would anticipate that high on the agenda will be getting a readout from Secretary Lew about his trip to Puerto Rico. And I just described to you some of what Secretary Lew saw firsthand when he visited Puerto Rico, and I would anticipate that he'll talk with the President about that a little bit more as well.\nI would also anticipate that other budgetary issues will be on the agenda as well. But once that meeting concludes, we'll see if we can get you some more details about what they discussed.\nAngela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Following up on the line of questioning about Brazil, there's a very real possibility that there could for some time be two Brazilian Presidents concurrently, one interim President and one suspended President. How would the administration handle relations with Brazil if that does come to pass?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously would follow the traditions and the laws of Brazil. And, again, what I understand about this process comes entirely from reading news accounts of what's happening there -- or almost entirely of news accounts from what's happening there. And the way that I understand how this process works is that if the vote in the Senate goes the way that many people are predicting, then President Rousseff would step aside while the charges against her are heard by the appropriate legislative body. And the current Vice President would assume the constitutional powers of the presidency until such time as the allegations against President Rousseff are resolved. That's my understanding about the way the process works, and the U.S. government and our diplomats who are serving in Brazil would engage with the Brazilian government according to their rules and traditions.\nQ: And does this situation provide an opening, potentially, for an improvement of relations with Brazil? They've been an important partner of the U.S., but the government has been in power for over a decade -- the party has been in power that was aligned with the U.S. interests. Is there a silver lining here for the U.S. in the disarray of the Brazilian government?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, President Rousseff was here at the White House a little over a year ago, and I think that a hallmark of that visit was effective coordination between the United States and Brazil on a whole range of issues -- everything from the economy to national security to even climate change. So we've been able to do a lot of important work with the Brazilian government, and we'd certainly look for any additional opportunities that are available to cooperate with them even further to make progress on priorities that President Obama has identified.\nGardiner.\nQ: Does the President support Paul Ryan's plan to confront the opioid crisis? He recently came out with a plan.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have heard some discussion about their plan. I think it's a series of bills that they have -- I believe it's 18 different bills that they're considering, none of which actually include any funding, which is unfortunate and it raises questions about what exactly they hope the impact of these bills would be. I know that there has been some concern expressed by the Speaker's office that the political turmoil inside the Republican Party is overshadowing this particular legislative effort. I think my observation would be, if there were actually some substance behind this legislative effort, it might get some more deserved attention. If there were actual funding in here to support more access to treatment and more evidence-based treatment options for people across the country, I suspect it would be worthy of more public attention.\nBut, unfortunately, that's not the option that Republicans have chosen. It is particularly unfortunate because the President put forward his own proposal, totaling about a billion dollars that would make important investments in research and treatment and recovery programs. But as you'll recall, Gardiner, Republicans for the first time in four decades declined to even hear from the President's Budget Director about that priority.\nSo Republicans paying lip service to an issue that they know is important to voters, without actually doing something substantive to address it, and, in fact, actively blocking Obama administration efforts to address it is kind of an old story, but it's the reputation that Republicans have embraced for seven years now and it's a reputation that they demonstrate is well-earned.\nQ: Back to the refugee numbers. The President is hosting a refugee summit in September. It looks like, as you have somewhat admitted, you're going to be way behind on admitting even the small number of Syrian refugees that the President has vowed to admit. How is the administration, how is the President going to speak with these world leaders and urge them to do more when the United States seems to not only have such a paltry goal on Syrian refugees to begin with but is probably not even going to be close to meeting even that small goal at that point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, there are several more months left in the fiscal year. And at this point in time in the last fiscal year, there was skepticism about whether or not the administration would succeed in meeting the goal for admitting refugees that we had set for last year. And in the last few months of the fiscal year, the pace ramped up and that goal was met.\nThis administration is focused on doing that again, but we will not do that in a way that results in a weakening of security standards. This is a challenging task. Individuals who enter the United States through the refugee program are subjected to more scrutiny, more vetting, and more background checks than anybody else who enters the United States. And the President is determined to keep those strict security measures in place, even as we ramp up the number of people who are admitted to the United States. That imposes a significant strain on our system, but the President is determined to meet that goal. He has made that clear to his team, and that's something that we're going to continue to strive for.\nI think when you step back and look at the longer-term picture in terms of the United States record on the U.N. refugee program, it's hard for other countries to criticize, particularly when you consider that over the last several years the United States has taken in more people through the U.N. refugee program than every other nation in the world -- than all the other nations in the world combined.\nBut given the significant crisis in Syria, it's clear that those efforts need to be expanded not just here in the United States but in other countries around the world. And that's what the goal of the U.N. meeting will be, will be to encourage nations around the world to raise their ambitions when it comes to meeting the basic humanitarian needs of people who are fleeing their homes to escape violence.\nLauren.\nQ: On Capitol Hill today there is a meeting -- a hearing about Boko Haram, and one of the people who are testifying is a schoolgirl who was abducted. What the lawmakers are saying is that Boko Haram is the most dangerous terrorist organization. Does the White House agree with that, or does that honor go to al Qaeda and ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, the President understands how dangerous Boko Haram is. That is why we have devoted significant resources to assisting the Nigerian government and building up their capacity to confront Boko Haram in their country. We're mindful of that threat, and we understand the terrible violence that they have perpetrated against innocent people not just in Nigeria but across that region.\nSo the United States continues to stand with the Nigerian government and the Nigerian people as they face down this threat. And we're mindful of the need to continue to apply pressure to those extremist organizations, and aren't able to establish the kind of foothold that would allow them to significantly expand the territory and people that are affected by their violent acts.\nQ: Are they worse?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's hard to say. But obviously we take the threat that they pose quite seriously. This is a terrible, violent extremist organization, and we've worked hard to support the Nigerian government as they've gone after them.\nQ: There were three suicide bombings in Baghdad today, targeting Shiite Muslims. Is it the U.S.'s responsibility to promote religious liberty in that region?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the values of the United States are values that we're interested in promoting everywhere, and obviously there are different cultures, different security climates, but we certainly -- the President takes seriously the responsibility that our government has to promote our values around the world. And I think that even a casual observer of this situation would acknowledge that just a little bit of religious tolerance in this part of the world would go a long way to addressing the kind of chaos and violence that has stemmed from many of the sectarian atrocities that have been committed.\nAtsushi.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple of things about the President's upcoming trip to Vietnam and Japan. Firstly, on Japan, I understand the President will provide a forward-looking vision when he visits Hiroshima. Will the President also mention not only about Hiroshima but Nagasaki during the speech or deliver that message?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have much of a preview of those comments to share with you at this point. I know that in some places, the President's visit to Hiroshima was covered as the President planning to give a major speech in Hiroshima. That's not accurate. When he visits Hiroshima, I would anticipate the President will have an opportunity to reflect on his time there, but the President does not plan to deliver a major address in Hiroshima. But I don't have any more details about those remarks to share at this point, but as it gets closer, we'll keep you posted.\nQ: How is the President going to deliver the message? In front of the audience or just in front of the media outlets?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our advance team is preparing to arrive in Japan in just a couple of days, so we're still working through the logistics and we'll keep you posted.\nQ: Does the President have a plan to visit the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, we're still working through the logistics of the President's visit, but we'll keep you posted. These are all good questions. As we get farther down the line of planning the President's visit, we'll be able to give you more detail about what the President will see.\nQ: On Vietnam, President Obama will visit Vietnam for the first time and the second visit of a sitting President, I believe. Is there any significant meaning in terms of reconciliation between the two countries, the United States and Vietnam? In Ho Chi Minh City, what's the plan? What is the plan for the President to visit, or what kind of message is the President going to deliver in Saigon?\nMR. EARNEST: The President will spend a couple of days in Vietnam. It is his first trip to Vietnam as President of the United States, and the President will spend time with the kind of bilateral program that you've come to expect when you see the President travel overseas. He'll meet with high-ranking government officials and spend time talking about the importance of our bilateral relationship. And I'm confident that will touch on aspects of our security relationship but also aspects of our economic relationship as well.\nVietnam has been a part of the TPP negotiations, and the prospect of Vietnam taking steps to raise labor, human rights, and environmental standards, and give U.S. businesses more access to a rapidly growing Vietnamese middle class is a good thing. And the President will certainly continue to assure the government and the people of Vietnam that the United States is serious about implementing the TPP agreement. We recognize that it would have a positive impact on the U.S. economy and U.S. strategic interests in the region. We also recognize it would have a positive impact on Vietnam's economy and on Vietnam's national security as well. We would welcome the deeper ties that would result from an enhanced economic relationship.\nQ: What about the maritime security cooperation?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that will be a part of the discussion, too. Obviously maritime security is quite relevant to the day-to-day security concerns of the Vietnamese government. And obviously the United States would like to see those maritime security questions, particularly as it relates to claims on land features in the South China Sea, be resolved through diplomacy and through established international rules of order. So we certainly will support that effort, and the President will lend his continued support to that in the context of this visit.\nDave, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Susan Rice gave a speech in Florida today in which she said that the country's various national security agencies suffer from a lack of diversity. And she said that if the leadership at those agencies was more diversified they would \"make better decisions.\" Does the President agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly believes that our government is most effective and is making the best decisions when we have a government that looks like the country. And the President has made a concerted effort to encourage Americans of all backgrounds to consider a career in public service. There are obviously a variety of ways to contribute to our country. In some cases, that might be joining the military. In some cases, that may be signing up to be a diplomat to represent U.S. interests around the world. In other cases, that might just be joining civil service and finding ways to serve in communities all across the country.\nThe President believes that our country is strongest when Americans of all backgrounds both consider that as a career option but also have an opportunity to be promoted and to be considered for high-ranking positions in those kinds of roles. And those opportunities are I think understandably and even rightfully given most often to people that have a lot of experience in those agencies and in that kind of work. So encouraging young people as they are considering the start of their career to consider a career in public service isn't just good for the country, it's also good for ensuring over the long term that the senior levels of the U.S. government are filled with government employees that reflect the diversity of America.\nQ: Talking about senior-level people, she said, minorities still make up less than 20 percent of our senior diplomats and less than 15 percent of our senior military officers and senior intelligence officials. Given the fact that the President has been President for almost eight years, isn't that implicit criticism of his appointments? Is he having trouble finding qualified nominees?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think that she intended it to be implicit criticism of the President's appointments. I think when you take a look at the effort that the President has undertaken to ensure that we have a government that reflects the diversity of America, we've made historic progress in that regard. We've obviously talked about the President's record of judicial appointments, and so the President has a record that he's proud of.\nBut let me just go back to this point because I think this is the point that Susan is trying to make. The best way for us to ensure over the long term that the senior ranks of government positions are filled by people who reflect the diversity of this country is to ensure that as people are considering the beginning of their career, that they're considering a career in public service; that giving more minorities in particular the opportunity to start a career in public service and rise through the ranks means that future Presidents will have a much more diverse pool of applicants to consider when making senior-level appointments, and that's a good thing. If you're asking somebody to take a senior-level management position in an agency, for example, having agency experience is a good credential to have.\nAnd the President has certainly considered that carefully when he has made his senior-level appointments. And so when you have a pool of applicants that has a lot of experience in the government and that pool of applicants in more diverse, it's going to make it easier for future generations or for future U.S. Presidents to have a whole generation of government employees and civil servants to choose from that's more diverse. And that's a good thing, and that will be good for the long-term strength of our country.\nI guess the point is, that is an effect that is not going to be felt in the short term, and certainly not one that is going to be obviously detected over the course of just one presidency or even two. But the President is hopeful that 15 or 20 years from now, that a future President will have a more diverse pool of applicants to choose from when considering senior-level government appointments.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:18 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-05-11", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday spoke to a pair of big rallies here in Big Sky Country ahead of Montana's presidential primary election. He was greeted with cheers when he said he is the most electable candidate for president.\nSome 9,100 Sanders supporters came out on a sunny spring day to Caras Park in Missoula for a rally on the banks of the Clark Fork River. Hours later, another 3,000 packed the Montana Pavilion in Billings.\nTwenty-seven delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention are at stake in the June 7 primary. With eight states still set to hold primaries or a caucus in the closing weeks of the nominating process, Sanders renewed his pledge to stay in the race with Hillary Clinton until the convention in Philadelphia in July.\n\"If we can do really well - it is a steep climb and I admit it - but we can end up with more pledged delegates, real delegates, delegates elected by the people than Secretary Clinton,\" Sanders told the Billings rally.\nThe senator from Vermont so far has won victories in 19 states and amassed 46 percent of the pledged delegates. He picked up more with back-to-back wins the past two Tuesdays. He carried every county in West Virginia on Election Day this week. He scored another upset win over Clinton one week ago in Indiana.\nSanders called it \"strange and undemocratic\" that 450 superdelegates - elected officials and party officials - backed Clinton even before Sanders entered the presidential campaign last April 30. \"That's not democracy. That's the establishment defending its own interests,\" Sanders said.\nIn West Virginia, for example, Sanders soundly defeated Clinton 51 percent to 36 percent in Tuesday's primary election. As a result of the popular vote, he won 18 elected pledged delegates to her 11. But six of the state's seven superdelegates back Clinton. In other states - including Minnesota, Washington and Colorado - Sanders won by double-digit margins but the party establishment figures are clinging to Clinton.\nSanders also made the case for why he would be the Democrats' best choice to win in November. In yet another new poll published on Wednesday, Sanders trounced Trump 48 percent to 39 percent in a general election matchup. That 11-point lead contrasts with Clinton's 2-point margin over Trump in the same Economist/YouGov Poll. She was supported by 42 percent to his 40 percent.\n\"You are looking at the strongest Democratic candidate,\" Sanders said.", "timestamp": "2016-05-11", "title": "Press Release - 'You're Looking at the Strongest Candidate,' Sanders Says in Montana"}

Senator, good to see you. First, congratulations on West Virginia.\nSANDIERS: Thank you very much.\nMITCHELL: But at the same time, you come out of there, at least now by our count, with a 17-17 delegate divide. So you win big but you still don't catch up. You don't close that gap. What's the path moving forward?\nSANDERS: You know, Andrea, it -- it is interesting and you raise a good point. Hillary Clinton got I think 35 percent, 36 percent of the vote, popular vote yesterday, and yet she gets six out of seven of the superdelegates. And that's what we've been seeing all over this country. In many cases, we win landslide victories, 65 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent of the vote, and she gets the superdelegates. I think the people of many of those states are going to be saying to those superdelegates, hey, you know what? Why don't you reflect the views of the people in the state who voted for Bernie Sanders? And that's one of the areas that we're going to be focusing on in the coming weeks.\nMITCHELL: Well, certainly that sounds like one of the areas you're going to be focusing on in terms of trying to get reform, commitments from her, from her team at the convention or before, that the process is going to change.\nSANDERS: Well, no, what we're going to be focusing on in the next month is winning the Democratic nomination. Right now, Andrea, we have about 45.5 percent of the pledged delegates. That is the real delegates who are voted on by the people. There are eight primaries and caucuses remaining. We think many of the states in front of us are sympathetic to a progression mission -- message of standing up for the working class and the middle class against Wall Street and the billionaire class. We think we're going to do very, very well. And if we do extremely well -- and I know it's a steep climb but we have been fighting an uphill battle from day one -- but if we do very, very well, we still have the possibility of coming in with the majority of pledged delegates.\nMITCHELL: Who is in charge and how are you working this attempt to get the superdelegates, to recruit them, to switch them over? Are you making calls yourself, for instance? Do you have an operation? Tell us what's going on.\nSANDERS: Well, we are going to have a very strong operation and the point that we're going to make to the superdelegates is a very simple one. Over 400 superdelegates came on board Secretary Clinton's campaign before anybody else was in the race. Before anybody else was running. That's pretty crazy. And that talks about the weakness of this whole superdelegate system.\nNo. 2, the point that we're going to make loud and clear is that in virtually every national poll that's been out there in the last month or six weeks, and in almost state poll, Bernie Sanders runs stronger against Donald Trump than does Hillary Clinton. And I think what every delegate to the Democratic National Convention wants, most importantly, is to defeat Donald Trump. The case we'll make is that I am the stronger candidate.\nAnd it's not only polling. Polling goes up and down. It is the fact that our campaign is the campaign bringing in working class people, bringing in young people, people who are sick and tired of establishment politics, establishment commitments, establishment media. People in this country are hurting. They want real change. We are the campaign of that change.\nMITCHELL: Well, Senator Sanders, flying in the face of that is the exit poll data from West Virginia that shows that 34 percent, 34 percent of the Sanders voters said that they would vote for Donald Trump in a Trump/Sanders match-up.\nSANDERS: Well, that is what some of those people are saying today.\nMITCHELL: A third of them.\nSANDERS: The general election, as you know, is in November. I think in a race with Donald Trump, Andrea, not only do I think we would win that race, I think we would win it overwhelmingly. Because I think the people of America, the more they see Mr. Trump, understand that he's a total phony, that what he said yesterday is not what he's going to say tomorrow. That he is a pathological liar and that he gets a lot of media attention for attacking people but that is going to wear thin.\nThe American people understand there's something wrong when they are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all new income and wealth goes to the 1 percent. They understand there's something wrong when we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people or paid family and medical leave.\nBottom line is, the American people are not going to go to an establishment billionaire who changes his mind every day. They want I think a president who has a life history of fighting for working people and prepared to take on big money interests.\nMITCHELL: But isn't the bottom line about you versus Hillary Clinton and who would be the stronger candidate, that she is now fighting a war on two fronts? She's getting beaten up by Donald Trump on a daily basis. Aside him from calling you Crazy Bernie in his tweet, he has been embracing you. He is building you up. He likes the fact that you're taking her down. So she's fighting Donald Trump. She's fighting Bernie Sanders.\nSANDERS: One -- one second. One second. One second..\nMITCHELL: And that's depressing her overall --\nSANDERS: Andrea, no, I don't accept -- Andrea, I don't accept that proposition. Last I heard, Hillary Clinton is running for President of the United States. I am running for president of the United States. Trump is running for President of the United States. And what a candidate does is make his or her best case to the American people.\nI have gotten attacked and attacked and attacked. My record has been misinterpreted and lied about. The issue of this campaign is to go out to the American people and talk about why the American people are working, are struggling. Hillary Clinton has got to make that case. Trump has got to make that case. Sanders has got to make that case. And that's what we intend to do.\nMITCHELL: I'm just saying that --\nSANDERS: And I know -- yes, I'm sorry.\nMITCHELL: I'm just saying that -- sir, I'm just saying that Hillary Clinton's - the opposition to her, the negatives against her, have been built up by Donald Trump just hammering away at her. And up until now at least he has not been going after you as much. She's fighting two candidates and you're fighting one.\nSANDERS: Andrea, Andrea -- oh really. Oh, really? Hah. Andrea, in every state that we have one, in 19 states, we have had to take on the entire Democratic establishment. We've had to take on senators and governors and mayors and members of Congress. That's what we have taken on, so please do not moan to me about Hillary Clinton's problems.\nI'm in this race to win. We're taking on the Democratic establishment. We are standing up for working people and we have a shot. It is a steep hill to climb, but we're going to fight for every last vote that we can get, every delegate that we can get. And that's what I intend to do in the next month, five weeks.\nMITCHELL: Well, I don't think I was moaning about Hillary Clinton's problems. But just to point out, let me play a little bit of Donald Trump on \"Morning Joe\" and ask you to react.\n[begin video clip]\nDONALD TRUMP: Well, Bernie Sanders has a message that's interesting. I'm going to be taking a lot of the things that Bernie said and using them. He said some things about her that are actually surprising, you know, that essentially she has no right to even be running and that she's bad judgment. When he said bad judgment, I said, \"Sound bite!\"\n[end video clip]\nMITCHELL: So if you do --\nSANDERS: If Donald Trump --\nMITCHELL: I'm just saying, if you do lose, then are you giving him the weapons against her?\nSANDERS: Well, if Donald Trump wants to take my ideas and fight for a single payer national health care program or wants to fight to make sure that the wealthiest people in this country, like Donald Trump, start paying their fair share of taxes, wants to make sure that we have paid family and medical leave, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure -- if that's what Donald Trump is supporting, I think that's a good thing. And I hope Hillary Clinton does that as well.\nBut, frankly, because that is not what Donald Trump will be saying.\nPoint is, when you run for President of the United States you got to make your case to the American people. And in fact, as you well know, there are many areas that I could have attacked Hillary Clinton on that I have chosen not to attack her on. What I have done is run an issue-oriented campaign. That is what the American people want.\nAnd, by the way, when you have a real debate about real issues, when you get more and more people involved in the political process, it results in a higher voter turnout. Democrats will win in November, whether it's Clinton or myself as the candidate, when there is a high voter turnout. Republicans win when there is a lower voter turnout. I think a vigorous debate, an honest debate about the real issues facing the American people, will result in a higher voter turnout, which is good for Democrats.\nMITCHELL: Speaking of real issues, Donald Trump went after Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton repeatedly over the weekend, dredging up all sorts of personal attacks. I wanted to play a little bit of that for you and ask your reaction.\n[begin video clip]\nTRUMP: She's married to a man who hurt many women. And Hillary, if you look and you study, Hillary hurt many women, the women that he abused. Do you remember the famous \"I did not have sex with that woman\" and then a couple months later, \"I'm guilty.\" And she's taking negative ads on me.\n[end video clip]\nMITCHELL: He's called her an enabler. Do you agree with that?\nSANDERS: Look, the media loves that kind of stuff and that's why Trump is doing so well. That is the kind of ugly stuff that I do not go near. No, I debate Hillary Clinton on the important issues facing working people. The media loves every ridiculous remark that Donald Trump makes. But we are going to stay focused on the issues. And the issues are a growing gap between the very rich and everybody else, and that we have a government and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables the wealthy and the powerful to control legislation and economic decisions in this country. I want a government that represents all of us, not just the 1 percent.\nThose are the issues that I talk about, not Bill Clinton's personal life, not Hillary Clinton's emails, not the Clinton Foundation. That is what Trump will talk about; that's what the media will talk about. I will focus on the issues facing working families in this country and I hope the media will allow that discussion to take place.\nMITCHELL: And as you say, it's a hard climb to narrow this gap. But -- and if you don't, will you feel that the revolution has succeeded if she has moved to your positions on a lot of these issues and if you open up the democratic process and have fewer primaries like the closed primary in New York that you've complained so much about?\nSANDERS: Well, Andrea, our focus right now is on winning Democratic nomination. But this is what I want to say, whether I win or whether I don't. The Democratic Party has got to note that we have won in virtually every contested contest out there. We have won a strong majority of people 45 years of age or younger. The ideas that I am bringing forth in this campaign are in fact the future of America and the future of the Democratic Party. And the Democratic Party is going to have to open their doors very, very wide to millions of working class people and young people tired of establishment politics, who want real change in this country. Don't want a party dependent on Wall Street; they want a party that is going to stand up and fight against Wall Street. That is what the Democratic Party has got to do. If I am elected president, that is certainly what the Democratic Party will do. But I hope it happens in any case.\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us today.\nSANDERS: Thank you, Andrea.", "timestamp": "2016-05-11", "title": "Interview with Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC"}

I should add that Congress could do even more if we get the Trans-Pacific Partnership passed, because TPP contains additional enforcement tools for us to be able to make sure that any of the countries that are signed up for this have to work with us to prevent this kind of theft of trade secrets. And at a time when the Asia-Pacific region is growing rapidly and where American businesses are competing, unfortunately, one of the problems that we have in that region is the tendency to steal trade secrets, produce knockoffs for those markets, and we end up losing business, and that means we're losing American jobs.\nSo again, I want to thank everybody here who's done outstanding work.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117423", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:06 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions for maximum efficiency today. Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thank you, Josh. So a U.S. District Court judge has ruled today that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally making payments to insurers covering reductions for certain enrollees. I wanted to ask how problematic is this ruling for the health insurance program overall. And what are the ramifications for plans and consumers if this stands?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, this is not the first time that we've seen opponents of the Affordable Care Act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system. There are a couple of things that are unprecedented about this effort, though. This suit represents the first time in our nation's history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute. There have obviously been significant differences between the executive branch and Congress recently. But these are the kinds of political disputes that characterize a democracy. And it's unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to refight a political fight that they keep losing. They've been losing this fight for six years. And they'll lose it again.\nQ: Will the administration appeal the ruling? And secondly, if this does go through, what are the ramifications? Will insurers be leaving the program? Will this have an impact on the price for consumers?\nMR. EARNEST: My colleagues at the Department of Justice obviously just started reviewing the ruling because it was just handed down a few minutes ago. So any sort of formal announcement about an intent to appeal will be announced from the Department of Justice. But we are quite confident in the power of the legal arguments that we're able to make here. But any sort of formal announcement about an appeal will come from the Department of Justice. And I have not heard at this point any sort of analysis about the potential impact of a legal outcome consistent with this decision.\nQ: The Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has invited Ben Rhodes to testify at a hearing on the Iran nuclear deal. Is this an invitation that the White House has to accept or reject?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with all due respect to the Chairman, if he has an interest in a hearing about false narratives as it relates to the Iran deal, then I've got some suggestions for people that they should swear in. In fact, some members of the committee actually may have some light to shed on this. Congressman Ken Buck from Colorado promised in August of 2015 that Iran would get $100 billion to $200 billion in sanctions relief. Congressman Buck is either wrong or lying, and he can discuss that with the committee. He's a member of the committee, so presumably he knows where the hearing room is, so he can just show up at the appointed time and explain his false declaration.\nPaul Gosar -- I assume I'm pronouncing that correctly -- he was quoted in September of 2015, saying that this would provide immediate access to approximately $100 billion. Again, we now know -- we can verify that's not true. So again, I don't know if Mr. Gosar was just wildly misinformed or was lying to the American public. But presumably, if he feels so strongly about this issue, he can explain himself under oath before the committee. He serves on the committee, too, so it shouldn't be too hard to arrange his schedule.\nCynthia Lummis, congresswoman -- she explained that, in September of 2015, she claimed that the proposed deal \"will lead to a nuclear-armed Iran.\" That, of course, has not turned out to be true. And, in fact, we can verify that that is false. So Congresswoman Lummis serves on the committee. Why don't we swear her in and explain where she got this information. And she can explain whether she was just wrong or lying. She may also explain why she continues to make this argument.\nI don't know what the protocol is for swearing in members of the United States Senate to participate in these kinds of hearings, but there are any number of senators who could participate. Senator Cruz could certainly participate. He claimed, in August of 2015, over $100 billion will flow into Iran as a result of the deal. We've got Senator Tom Cotton, who I know has a special relationship with the Supreme Leader, so maybe he's got some interesting insight into the deal that he would like to share with the committee. He said that the deal \"gives them\" -- meaning, Iran -- \"$150 billion of sanctions relief.\" Not true. Senator Cotton, wildly wrong or lying. And so let's have Chairman Chaffetz get to the bottom of this. Maybe the American people do want to actually understand the Republican false narrative about the Iran deal. So we would welcome the opportunity for those members of Congress to explain themselves.\nThe truth is, what the administration has said about the Iran deal, what Mr. Rhodes has said about the Iran deal, what the President of the United States has said about the Iran deal has come true. Our critics said that Iran would never go along with an agreement. They did. They signed on the dotted line. Our critics said that there would never be a way to verify that Iran would live up to the terms of the agreement. We know they did. International, impartial inspectors did exactly that, and they were given the access that they needed to confirm that Iran had lived up to their end of the bargain. And our critics said -- and I just recited many of them -- that Iran would get, as Steve Scalise, who could also testify, said that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. That's false. That's not true. Even Iran says that that's not true. In fact, they're saying that they are hoping that they can get access to more money.\nSo again, I don't know whether our critics were just wildly misinformed, mistaken, or lying. But if Republicans are interested in getting to the bottom of this, then they should just swear in some members of their own conference and figure it out.\nQ: So I take that as a no. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are some people who have some explaining to do when it comes to the wildly false accusations that they made about the Iran deal. And it's not the administration; it's Republicans who are demonstrably wrong when it comes to the Iran deal. So we'll look at the letter, but I assume that -- if Congressman Chaffetz is actually interested in getting to the bottom of this deal, then I assume that similar letters were received through the interoffice mail in the House of Representatives.\nQ: Just one quick follow-up on that. You've taken issue with the more than -- the predictions of more than $100 billion in sanctions relief. Do you know how much has actually resulted in --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know it's a whole lot less than that. What we had said in the context of the deal before it went through, that the kind of benefit that Iran was likely to enjoy was something around $50 billion, but even a significant chunk of that money was committed to repaying debts that Iran owed. That's why you saw Iran's central bank governor come out and indicate that their expectations about the amount of sanctions relief that they would receive was around $30 billion. I don't have an updated assessment to share in terms of the amount that they have actually received, but it is by all accounts far less than the false criticism that was put forward by Republicans.\nTim.\nQ: Any reaction now that Rousseff in Brazil has been suspended by the senate?\nMR. EARNEST: Not any one that's different than I've shared from here a couple of times. This is an outcome that many observers expected. And the President does continue to have confidence in the durability of Brazil's democratic institutions to withstand the political turmoil there.\nQ: Anyone in the White House reaching out to the acting President?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any calls that have been placed by the White House to the acting President's office. But you might check with the State Department to see if there have been any sort of diplomatic conversations.\nQ: And on the global steel glut that President Obama spoke about with Australia PM Turnbull, as the readout said last night. We saw the comments from USTR and Penny Pritzker last month, but does this suggest that there is some new White House initiative that might be going on? A broader initiative to tackle the glut?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what both Ambassador Froman and Secretary Pritzker made clear in those statements is that the United States is working both bilaterally and through multilateral institutions, including the OECD, to build a policy consensus on addressing the excess capacity in the steel market and some other industries as well.\nSo we're going to continue to pursue vigorous international engagement as part of a broader effort that includes aggressive enforcement right here at home. So, for instance, the United States government has initiated an historic number of trade remedy proceedings in 2015, assessing more than $45 million in penalties on importers of steel products for violating their obligation to pay anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\nSo the enforcement of these rules is something that the administration takes quite seriously, and it's also an important part of our foreign policy. So when President Obama is on the phone with world leaders, including the leader of Australia, we're talking about a range of issues. We're talking about important national security issues; we're talking about broader economic issues; but we're also talking about the importance of addressing something as technical as excess capacity in steel.\nAnd so I think those who follow this issue closely will recognize that that's not a particularly surprising development. But for those who don't, this should be a revealing look at the priority that the President places on enforcing trade agreements.\nQ: Also, Prime Minister Turnbull told the press in Australia that Obama advised him that the new time frame for TPP would be at the end of the year, after the elections. And that sort of contradicts what President Obama said in Germany. He said he thought it could be done after the primaries. So does the White House see the new congressional window for TPP is in doubt in the lame duck?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any more information to share about the conversation between Prime Minister Turnbull and President Obama. Our view is that Congress should act as quickly as possible to implement this agreement; that delaying the implementation of the agreement only puts off the significant benefits that American businesses and American workers can enjoy as a result of the agreement.\nFor example, once this deal is implemented, we'll conduct the work of cutting 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods. So the longer that Congress delays the implementation of the TPP the longer American businesses and American goods will be subject to these 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American products.\nSo the good news is that many Republicans on Capitol Hill share the President's view that cutting those taxes would be good for the American economy and they'd be good for American businesses and it would be good for American workers. So we're going to work with those Republicans to identify the most expeditious timeframe possible for Congress to do the work that's necessary to implement this agreement.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask about Merrick Garland's upcoming speech at a high school commencement. This is a little bit unusual for a Supreme Court nominee. And I'm wondering if he's going to be specifically addressing the nomination fight during his speech to students.\nMR. EARNEST: He will not, Jordan. He will be specifically addressing the class of 2016 at Niles West. Obviously, he is an alum of that fine institution, and he was invited by the principal of the school to deliver the commencement address. And obviously that community, and that high school in particular, is quite proud of the accomplishments of what probably is now their most famous graduate. And so it seemed like a good opportunity for him to address the class of 2016.\nI had an opportunity to talk to him about this a couple of weeks ago, and I know that he's very much looking forward to going back and reliving some old high school memories, but also having an opportunity hopefully to impart some wisdom and inspiration to the class of 2016.\nQ: Any more details on the subjects he's going to speak about during that?\nMR. EARNEST: No, you'll have to show up and find out. It should be fun.\nRacquel.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. So President Dilma, as was mentioned before, she was suspended from office for the duration of her impeachment trial. Michel Temer, who was her Vice President, became now the acting President with authority to appoint ministers and enact policies. How does the U.S. government view this impeachment process? And also, what does the White House expect from this new government? Will President Obama call the acting President, Michel Temer?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any planned calls, but if a call like that were to take place, we would certainly let you know. As a government, we intend to respect the government institutions and traditions and procedures that the Brazilian government follows for governing that country. That's what we would expect other countries to do when they're observing our legislative process, for example. All too often, a legislative process here in the United States doesn't work nearly as rapidly as we would like, and there may be other countries who get a little frustrated about that kind of inaction. But we assured them, invariably, that the President is pretty frustrated by how slow that process works as well. But our expectation is that we're going to follow the rules and laws and institutions of the United States government in handling the affairs of the United States. And we certainly are going to respect the Brazilian government as they follow the rules and traditions for governing their country, and that's what we'll do.\nQ: One more question. The White House says Brazil has a mature democracy, and today the suspended President, Dilma Rousseff, said that Brazil has a young democracy and called it a coup. Does the government, the U.S. government have any concern that this impeachment process is following the Brazilian laws?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly no expert on the Brazilian constitution, but our expectation is that the institutions of the Brazilian government that have been built up over the last few decades are sufficiently mature and durable to withstand the political turmoil that that country is facing right now. And that is not to downplay the obvious significance of the events of the last few weeks, but it is an effort to convey to the Brazilian government and to the Brazilian people that the United States values the important relationship that our two countries have. We cooperate on a wide range of issues, and the President had the opportunity to visit Brazil in his first term, and that was an opportunity for him to state affirmatively, early in his presidency, about the importance of the relationship between our two countries. That, of course, was renewed when President Rousseff visited the White House not too long ago.\nSo the United States will stand with Brazil, even through these challenging times, and we continue to have confidence in the capacity of the government to rely on their well-established traditions and laws to manage their way through this challenging time for their country's politics.\nJames. Nice to see you today. It's been a little while.\nQ: Likewise. Yes, sir. Three subjects I want to cover, very quickly on each one.\nFirst, the remarks this week by the FBI Director, James Comey, in a briefing to reporters at the Bureau, in which he once again described what he has alternately termed the \"Ferguson effect\" and the \"viral video effect.\" Previously, when he discussed those matters, it led to direct rebuke from the White House, both from this podium and you, and from the President himself. But the FBI Director appears to be doubling down on those comments in his most recent statement to reporters saying -- and I quote, \"There's a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal, additional policing that suppresses crime -- the getting out of your car at two in the morning and saying to a group of guys, hey, what are you doing here?\" I take it that in the time since this was last an issue between the White House and Director Comey in October and November of last year, nothing has arisen in crime statistics or any other external phenomena to cause the White House to now side with Director Comey in interpreting these events.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, James, I anticipated that somebody might ask this question today. I think it's certainly a relevant one, and I had an opportunity to talk to the President about it a little bit this morning.\nSo what I can tell you is that we have observed over the last year or so an uptick, in some communities across the country, in violent crime rates. And that's a source of some concern. And last year when this potential trend was first noticed, the President tasked his Attorney General with supporting the law enforcement agencies in those communities to help them confront the challenge of fighting that potential increase in violent crime.\nAnd there are a number of steps that the Department of Justice has taken. Earlier this spring, the Department of Justice announced that the U.S. Marshals Service had conducted a high-impact national fugitive apprehension initiative that was focused on the country's most violent offenders. And that six-week initiative resulted in the arrest of more than 8,000 gang members, sex offenders, and other violent criminals. That is an indication of the important role that federal law enforcement can play in supporting the work of local law enforcement in these communities.\nWhat's also true, though, is that, more broadly, crime rates across the country remain at or near historic lows. So the challenge for the Department of Justice has been to try to focus on those communities where the uptick has been noticed and try to blunt the impact of that.\nNow, as it relates to getting to the undermining cause of those upticks in violence, there still is no evidence to substantiate the claim that the increase in violent crime is related to an unwillingness of police officers to do their job. And I know that this is an observation that the Fraternal Order of Police has made in indicating that they don't believe that their members are afraid to get out of their cars and do their jobs.\nAnd so the President's point is that as we consider policy approaches to addressing those communities where we've seen an uptick in violent crime, we need to be making policy decisions that are based on facts and evidence, and not anecdotes.\nQ: And so what we have before us then is the spectacle of the FBI Director twice in six months, before the national press, making assertions about crime and incidents of crime that are, in the view of the White House, based not on the facts or the evidence, but on anecdotes, and doing so in a very public way. And so the resulting question is why this doesn't shake your confidence in the FBI Director.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in part because the FBI Director actually made clear that he didn't know exactly what was going on, either. And I think, look, the fact is, this is a complicated issue, and that's exactly the way that he described it. He said, \"Why does Dallas see a dramatic spike and Houston doesn't?\" He acknowledged -- he continued saying, \"It's a complicated, hard issue, but the stakes couldn't be higher.\" Later on, he said, \"I don't know for sure what's going on, but something has happened.\" Clearly, it has. We just need to make sure that our policy approach to addressing this situation is rooted in evidence and facts. And Director Comey has indicated -- and I think this was sort of part of the reason that this discussion arose -- is that Director Comey indicated that he was seeking out additional information and additional evidence about what was exactly happening in these communities.\nBut it's clear that we don't have enough evidence at this point to substantiate the claim that police officers not doing their job is the reason for this uptick. I think the President's concern actually is really focused on rebuking this false choice between protecting civil rights and fighting crime. The truth is, the vast majority of law enforcement officers that put on the uniform every day do both. They both are committed to fighting crime and doing it in a fair way. The best law enforcement agencies have made clear and have funded training and put in place policies that actually make it easier for their officers to pursue their job to fight crime and to do it in a fair way.\nAnd so the President is quite interested at a federal level of figuring out what additional support can be provided by the federal government to local law enforcement agencies as they pursue both tasks: fighting crime but also protecting civil rights.\nQ: Two other subjects, much more quickly, I hope. Returning to Iran and Ben Rhodes, did Mr. Rhodes seek approval from anyone in the White House management before agreeing to allow Mr. Samuels of the New York Times Magazine to shadow him and quote him as he did?\nMR. EARNEST: There was a decision made by the White House to cooperate with Mr. Samuels's reporting.\nQ: And that decision involved individuals aside from Rhodes himself?\nMR. EARNEST: Correct.\nQ: Has Mr. Rhodes been rebuked by anyone in the White House management structure following the publication of that article?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. Mr. Rhodes is somebody who has served this White House and this President with distinction. And that's true when you consider that he led the effort to open up a diplomatic channel with the Cubans to bring about an effort to normalize the relations between our two countries. Mr. Rhodes was at the forefront of our policy effort to transform our diplomatic relationship with Burma and to encourage the democracy that was forming there. And Ben has also played a leading role in trying to establish these programs that are focused on cultivating young leaders in regions across the country and helping them -- giving them access to the United States and cementing our relationship with them.\nSo Ben has had a very broad policy portfolio at the White House and he has carried out his responsibilities honorably and with distinction. And I think everybody here at the White House is quite proud to work with Mr. Rhodes.\nQ: But no one has told him that they considered his comments in The New York Times Magazine article to have been ill-advised?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware.\nQ: Final question on him, and following up on the earlier questions about the request for his testimony by the House Oversight Committee. I take it from your comments in saying that you're reviewing the letter from Congressman Chaffetz that the White House is not reflexively asserting an executive privilege claim with respect to this request.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. This has nothing to do with executive privilege.\nQ: Last subject. Both you and the President have, for a long time now, months now, jettisoned the standard posture of White House officials and the White House press briefing with respect to the opposing party's nominating process. Normally, it has been my experience in Washington, the White House waits until there's a nominee from the other party, doesn't wade into the process, doesn't comment on specific candidates or what they have to say, and says typically, the time will come for that.\nThat posture has been jettisoned here for months now with respect to Donald Trump, long before he cleared the field in his party. And one of the sets of comments by the President and others here has been to the effect that Mr. Trump's candidacy is already creating a great deal of consternation amongst foreign leaders and allies of the United States who are supposedly conveying these sentiments and these concerns to the White House and the State Department and so on. Put very simply, does President Obama view that the election of Donald Trump to the presidency would constitute a direct threat to the national security of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say it this way. President Obama has been asked on a number of occasions to weigh in on Mr. Trump's candidacy, and I think more often than not, the President has shared his opinions on this. So what I have tried to do is to choose my moments carefully and making a point about the impact of the election on the ability of President Obama to do his job. I've also made clear that President Obama's priority is focused on protecting the important progress that we've made over the last seven or eight years. And his interest in the election is rooted in the idea that he wants his successor to be somebody who's committed to building on that progress and not tearing it down.\nAnd that's the way that he has engaged in the debate so far. And the President has certainly expressed concerns in the past about some of the rhetoric that a number of Republican presidential candidates have used. And the President has observed that those kinds of comments and that kind of rhetoric does have an impact on our national security, and certainly has an impact on our standing in the world. It certainly has an impact on our relationships with other countries, and the President has observed that it's not at all unusual for world leaders to ask questions about comments that were uttered on the campaign trail.\nSo it clearly is having an impact. But I'll let the President, at the next opportunity that he has to take questions, choose to describe what impact he believes electing Mr. Trump would have on our national security.\nQ: Speak for yourself then. Do you see him as a threat to national security?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I try to choose my spots, and I don't think I'm going to choose this one.\nGo ahead Suzanne.\nQ: To follow up on that, Donald Trump has met with Republican leaders throughout the day here in Washington -- Reince Priebus and Speaker Ryan. And they've come out of these meetings and they've described them as productive, and that they're really uniting around their core principles -- at least that's what they're saying publicly -- to deny, what they say, is a third Obama administration. Is there any concern from the White House or allies of the White House that Democrats are now falling behind now that it seems some of the Republicans are kind of trying to coalesce around Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: You certainly have better-informed, more-experienced, and surely higher-paid analysts who can examine the fault lines of the Republican Party. But even as a novice, I suspect that -- well, even the joint statement that I read with some amusement today from Speaker Ryan and the Republican nominee, presumptive nominee, indicate that this was merely their first meeting. So I'm certainly not surprised to hear that.\nI think what I find to be interesting about this process is that Speaker Ryan has described his view that the entire Republican Party, including the presumptive presidential nominee, should rally behind the agenda that Speaker Ryan has put forward. I think the reason that he may be encountering some difficulty is that he's the Speaker of the House. He should already be using the responsibility that he has to implement that agenda. And that is not at all what Republicans have done. That certainly is not what Leader McConnell has done on the Senate side, and it's not what Speaker Ryan has done on the House side.\nThere are any number of important, critical priorities that Republicans could be focused on in the House of Representatives right now and in the United States Senate that are an important part of the job they have right now. Unfortunately, Republicans seem much more focused on the elections than they do on embracing the responsibility to deal with the results of the last elections that gave them a majority in the United States Congress. But right now, we see Republicans much more focused on their relationship with the presumptive nominee than they are on things like passing a budget or passing funding for the Zika virus to avert a public health disaster, or passing much-needed funding to relieve the financial turmoil on Puerto Rico that's having a negative impact on 3 million Americans who live there. We certainly haven't seen any action in either House of Congress on funding programs to fight opioid addiction. We see the House trying to take victory laps on legislation that doesn't actually provide any money to ensure that any more people can get access to treatment.\nSo if Republicans had much conviction about their agenda, they'd be trying to implement it now as opposed to trying to convince other members of the Republican Party or the presumptive Republican nominee that what they propose is the right thing to do. If they thought it was the right thing to do, why wouldn't they be trying to implement it right now?\nAll the things that I've just outlined are things that Republicans at one point or another have indicated is a priority to them, and all those are things that I have said President Obama believes are a priority. In fact, we have been working hard to try to cajole Congress to act on a budget, to act on Zika, to act on Puerto Rico, to act on opioids. But they haven't. So I think that's why there might be skepticism both inside the Republican Party and outside the Republican Party that Republicans actually do have a governing agenda, because they've had an opportunity to present it and implement it, and they haven't done it. In fact, on this scorecard that I've just laid out, they haven't done anything.\nQ: But do you think it's just a show -- I mean, this show of unity, do you think it's genuine? And if it is, does that signal something that's even perhaps a little bit more dangerous from the administration's point of view?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know anybody here that's going to lose any sleep over the meeting.\nKenneth.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Going back to -- you mentioned Zika funding. We've talked about Brazil. With the summer games, in light of what's happening in Brazil with the impeachment proceeding starting, with the outgoing Zika crisis, outbreak in Brazil, will that impact the President's potential decision to attend the summer games? And also, does the President and the White House believe that the Olympics should be moved or delayed from Brazil?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the White House doesn't have that view. We're going to be strongly supportive of our friends in Brazil as they tackle the significant challenges that they're facing right now. And we've talked about the support that we have offered in terms of confronting this public health challenge related to the Zika virus, and there is some assistance that the United States has already provided. And we stand ready to provide additional assistance as needed to help Brazil fight Zika. We do that because, as we learned from Ebola, our investments and the capacity that other countries have to confront public health challenges ultimately has an impact on the public health and wellbeing and safety of the American people.\nSo we know that the preponderance of the Zika virus is much more intense in Brazil. And so we certainly stand ready to help them confront that challenge.\nAs it relates to the Olympics, I think hosting the Summer Olympics is a significant undertaking for any country that chooses to assume that challenge. And the truth is, the world is rooting for Brazil to succeed in hosting a Games that go off without a hitch. Ultimately, we want to be supportive of the effort of the Brazilians to host a Games where the venues are ready, where the Games take place safely and securely, and where we get to see the world's best athletes compete. So we're rooting for Brazil to succeed -- until it comes down to the actual competition, in which case we're going to be cheering for the Americans. (Laughter.)\nQ: Josh, obviously the President has been outspoken about gun violence, and he spoke out when the incident with Trayvon Martin happened. I'm curious if the White House has any reaction to George Zimmerman, the killer of Trayvon Martin, auctioning off, or trying to auction off the gun that was used to kill Trayvon Martin online. That since has been taken down, it appears. But any reaction to it appears that Zimmerman was using the gun to try to profit off that notoriety?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a reaction to it.\nQ: And one last follow-up for you. I'm pretty sure you're going to give a few more details on the State Dinner. We're curious if the White House feels that it was getting a five-for-one deal with the Nordic leaders. When it comes to state dinners, there's that one-on-one attention. And for those who perceive that this could be a snub, or perceived as a snub, your thoughts on that reaction to the fact that you're getting this five-for-one deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this merely is an opportunity for the President to repay the hospitality that he enjoyed when he traveled to Europe a year or two ago and met with the Nordic leaders in Europe. The United States obviously has an important relationship with these five countries. For those of you scoring along at home, this is Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Denmark. And these are all countries that the United States has important working relationships with. So there are a range of issues related to the economy and to national security that we'll surely discuss -- that the President will surely discuss with his counterparts.\nAnd there's an opportunity to talk about climate change. These countries, in some cases, are dealing with more persistent and severe impacts than we are here in the lower 48. And demonstrating our ongoing commitment to implementing the international agreement to fight carbon pollution will also be a subject of some discussion. So the President and First Lady are quite proud to host the leaders of these countries here at the White House tomorrow. And it will be filled with all the pomp and circumstance that we typically reserve for countries with whom the United States has important relationships. And the United States certainly has important relationships that are worth investing in with these five countries.\nRon.\nQ: Just to follow up on the Trump question. Just a minute ago, when you were answering questions about Donald Trump, you sounded perhaps a bit dismissive of him, and you were emphasizing the problems within the Republican Party, and so on and so forth. But the fact remains that he has won more Republican votes during the primary process than anyone else. And are you --\nMR. EARNEST: As he frequently repeats on television.\nQ: Well, it's true. And again, are you taking him seriously enough? Is the White House taking him seriously enough, or you being too dismissive of him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, first of all, I think that's a question that can primarily be posed to the Democratic candidates for President, because they are the ones who are competing in the election. And based on the robust, competitive primary process that has unfolded over the last several months here on the Democratic side, it seems quite clear that both Democratic candidates take their potential Republican opponent quite seriously. And the President himself stood at this podium last Friday and talked about how the stakes of this election were quite significant, and it shouldn't be reduced to a reality television program but rather should be subject to an intense debate around the issues and around the challenges that the next President will have to confront on behalf of the country.\nSo the President certainly takes this quite seriously. And as I mentioned in response to James's question, the President's principal concern here is we've worked really hard to dig ourselves out of a terrible economic hole over the last seven years. The President has worked hard to rebuild our relationship with our allies and partners around the world in a way that advances our interests and strengthens our national security. And the President doesn't want to see that eroded. In fact, he wants to make sure that he is succeeded by a President who recognizes that progress and is committed to building on it.\nAnd so the President is going to be engaged in the campaign for that reason. The President understands the stakes of this election, and I think that means that everybody who's participating in the election should be taken seriously.\nQ: So again, this day of unity, or whatever you want to call it -- I don't want to do PR for them -- you said --\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't want to either.\nQ: I'm sorry?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't want that job either.\nQ: You did complain about your salary a minute ago. (Laughter.)\nQ: In discussing that, you don't take that seriously, that, in fact, these leaders have come together -- that they do have perhaps an advantage because their nominee has been determined before the Democrat? I mean, I hate to -- six months from now, if we're talking about this, there could be a whole bit of evidence that suggests that the White House didn't take this seriously enough.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the people who primarily should take this seriously are the competitors in the election. And President Obama is keenly aware of the significant stakes of the outcome of the next election. And I assure you that over the next six months the President will be actively engaged in that debate. And he looks forward to his opportunity to engage more deeply.\nI think my point is -- again, you guys have far more-experienced, far better-sourced, and far better-paid analysts who can offer up their own insight about the disruption within the Republican Party. But I would just point out that even in the supposed statement of unity there's an observation that we will be having additional discussions. And the statement closes by indicating that this was our first meeting. So again, there is more work to be done there, and I think that's evident from the statement that the two men issued.\nQ: And on the President's schedule today I don't think there's anything really public on the schedule about what he's doing. And the schedule this week feels -- there was the national security meeting and bill signing -- but it feels to me like -- again, in my limited experience here -- that it's relatively light. And while you were very critical of what the Republicans aren't doing on Zika and Garland and other things, can you give us any more insight as to today exactly what the President is doing with any of these issues, since there's nothing being said publicly about what is it that he's doing? You talked to him about the issue you brought up about policing, but what else are you doing today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President does have a little bit of a lighter day than usual today, principally because he's got a very busy day tomorrow with five world leaders who he will be hosting here at the White House. I'd also point out that the President is going to deliver his commencement address at Rutgers University on Sunday, over the weekend. This is the 250th commencement exercises of that fine institution, and the President is looking forward to speaking to it. He also has got a speech he's got to work on, so he's going to spend some time working on that speech for Sunday, as well.\nQ: He's got a team of speechwriters, though.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, but I think, as April noted, the President tends to spend quite a bit more time on these commencement addresses because he takes them quite personally. So the President is being ably assisted by a couple members of the speechwriting team, but he's putting a lot of his own time and energy into this.\nQ: So in terms of information being presented in his public schedule, he's not being less transparent, you would say? Or he's not slowing down -- he's, as he said, keeping it all on the floor in the final months? It's just a clerical thing, perhaps, that the schedule doesn't reveal as much as it used to?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think I acknowledged that the President's schedule today was a little bit quieter, but that reflects the fact that he President has got a very full day tomorrow and then again on Sunday.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, does the President intend to sign the Senate bill that would authorize the ashes of the WASPs -- the Women Air Force Service Pilots -- to be buried at Arlington?\nMR. EARNEST: The President does intend to sign that legislation.\nQ: Do you have any timeframe on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. I don't know that we've even received it yet from the Congress. But we'll keep you posted on that.\nQ: And on China, or the country unnamed in the readout last night between Turnbull and Obama --\nMR. EARNEST: Really subtle, huh?\nQ: Yeah. A little passive-aggressive. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's the essence of diplomacy sometimes.\nQ: Indeed.\nMR. EARNEST: As you've covered more extensively than even I have.\nQ: I appreciate that. But can you give us a little bit more there? I mean, there was this pretty overt action, this maritime operation near that Chinese-occupied reef in the South China Sea. The U.S. and Australia coming quite close with warships. I mean, that's happening. The President is headed to Asia next week. The steel glut was named in that readout. Obviously, China is the one who's been getting a lot of blame for overproduction there. Would you say that tensions are on the rise with China?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not describe it that way. Our concerns about China's activities in the South China Sea are well-documented, and our concerns are concerns that we have raised both publicly and privately with Chinese officials at a range of levels. The freedom of navigation operation that was carried out by U.S. forces earlier this week is relatively routine. We've done at least a couple of times just in the last four or five months. And it is not intended to be a provocative act. It merely is a demonstration of a principle that the President has laid out on a number of occasions, which is that the United States will fly, operate and sail anywhere that international law allows. And this operation was undertaken consistent with that principle.\nAnd the concerns and the tensions that exist around the South China Sea don't actually directly involve the United States. The United States is not a claimant to any of the land features in the South China Sea. Our concern lies principally with the need for those parties that do have competing claims to resolve them through diplomacy. And we certainly do not want to see the tensions increase because of the risk that that could pose to the extensive international commerce that's conducted in that region of the world.\nSo I think this also underscores the complexity of the U.S. relationship with Australia. Australia is one of our closest allies, and we work with them on a range of issues. And I'll let the Australians describe the concerns that they may have, or the impact on their national security that tensions in the South China Sea may have. But obviously the Australian economy is affected by the glut of capacity in the steel industry in much the same way that the U.S. is, as well. I know that Prime Minister Turnbull has indicated his own priority for ensuring the international trade is conducted fairly. And that common ground is the basis for the kinds of conversations that President Obama and he have on a fairly regular basis.\nSo these are -- I think at the same time, the thing that sort of underlies all of this is we have been able to work with China in pursuit of other priorities. And we've talked about North Korea and the influence that the Chinese government has with North Korea. The sanctions that were imposed by the United Nations against North Korea that went further than any set of previous sanctions that have been imposed on them were only possible because the United States and China were able to cooperate in implementing them. Obviously, we've worked with China to complete the Iran deal that we discussed earlier. That would not have been possible without China's active participation in the discussions, but also, China had to be helpful in terms of imposing and enforcing the sanctions that compelled Iran to the negotiating table in the first place.\nSo I think this illustrates that there are differences of opinion that we have with China, and I'm certainly not seeking to downplay them. They're significant, and they have significant consequences for our economy in particular.\nBut they have not prevented the United States and China from being able to work effectively together to pursue other areas where we're in better agreement.\nQ: But why go out of your way to not name China? I mean, that's obviously who you were talking about. And then that's where the point of tension is. I mean, if you're having a destroyer go near a reef you're concerned are going to turn into an airstrip to land jets on, and that's a U.S. destroyer, I mean, that's a pretty overt signal. But you don't want to say China directly. I mean, it seems like an effort, a very concerted effort to avoid appearing to look confrontational.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we're not just trying to avoid appearing confrontational. I think I said in my previous answer that we certainly did not intend for that to be considered a provocative act. So I think we're being pretty explicit about that. And we've been explicit about that fact, both in public and in private, at a range of levels. And so --\nQ: And this doesn't -- the timeframe, with the President headed to the region, obviously everything is getting scrutinized in the region.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, and that's --\nQ: So that was a factor here, or no?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that Vietnam in particular has some concerns about competing claims in the South China Sea. We know that Vietnam is a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we certainly are looking to broaden our economic relationship with Vietnam. There's a rapidly growing middle class in Vietnam, and U.S. companies could benefit from the opportunity to do business in that part of the world. That would be good for the U.S. economy, it certainly would be good for U.S. workers, and the President is committed to pursuing that priority as he travels overseas.\nAnd look, we know that China sees the same potential benefit if they can increase their ability to do business inside of Vietnam. That's actually the essence of the argument that the President has made with regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- that if the United States and the rest of the international community doesn't go in and write the rules of the road for doing business in Vietnam, then China will. And the benefits of the United States being a part of those rules of road, it means we're going to have high labor standards, we're going to have higher human rights standards, higher environmental standards.\nChina hasn't made those things a priority, and we know that if China is given an opportunity to get a foothold in Vietnam, they certainly are not going to be interested in raising standards. You could even imagine a scenario where they might even allow those standards to be lowered even further.\nSo there's no denying that at least when it comes to our relationship with Vietnam, there are significant consequences for our relationship with China. But we never want to create a scenario in which we can't pursue our common interests with China, and the President has been quite clear about that. And we've been effective in implementing that strategy in a way that has had positive benefits for China and the United States. And, in fact, that's why the other thing that we often say in describing our relationship with China is that we welcome a rising China. In fact, that's the reason that we're hopeful that they can be persuaded to abide by the international rules of the road when it comes to resolving competing claims in the South China Sea.\nWhen you're an economy as large as China, when you're as influential as China is, particularly in that region of the world, then you benefit from the ability of disputes to be resolved without going to war, and you benefit from disputes being resolved with the expectation that everybody is going to follow the rules. And that's certainly the case that we make to China, and I think that's an indication of how we're able to work with China, how we welcome a rising China. But look, we're going to have our differences and we're not going to shy away from expressing those.\nQ: Quick question on Iran. With the Secretary of State in Europe, meeting with businesses, does the White House want to see more European banks do business in Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the White House wants is to fulfill our responsibility to international financial institutions to describe to them exactly what is allowed and what's not allowed when it comes to doing business with Iran. And that's something that has been part of not just Secretary Lew's job description, but Secretary Kerry has gone to great lengths to try to describe the rules of the road to international financial institutions as well.\nThere are a couple of things that I think are relevant to point out here. One of the things that these large -- that the heads of these banks say is that the United States has been forceful in enforcing these sanctions, which is why we want to be sure that we are on the right side of the law here. That's validation of what we have said here many times, which is that we take sanctions enforcement quite seriously, and there are large financial institutions that have had to pay big fines for circumventing those sanctions. So we're quite serious about that.\nI think the second thing that I would say is that Iran has expressed concerns about the fact that they're not getting the kind of engagement with the international business community that they would like to see. And I think our response to that is simply that there certainly is more that Iran can do to encourage that kind of international investment, because that international investment is looking for a stable business climate in which to do business. And if you are routinely testing ballistic missiles that violate United Nations sanctions that govern your ballistic missile program, well, that's not going to inspire the confidence of business leaders that this is a safe place to do business. If you are supporting terrorism around the world, that's not going to be particularly persuasive to business leaders that Iran is a good place to make an investment. So there's more that Iran can do --\nQ: But are you going to provide letters basically legally assuring these firms that they won't be prosecuted if they go ahead and do business? I mean, that's the level of insurance they want.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I'd refer you to the State Department or the Treasury Department or maybe even the Department of Justice in terms of what kind of assurances can be provided to international companies about what is appropriate and what's not when it comes to doing business with Iran.\nBut, look, the fact that you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State at different points sitting down with business leaders from around the world, I think that is an indication that we take quite seriously the responsibility that we have to help people understand what the rules are, because they should know that we're going to enforce them, but they should also know exactly what is allowable under the law that's on the books. And that's what both Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew have done.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, as you know, earlier this week, the lawsuit the Justice Department filed on Monday against North Carolina's anti-LGBT law is separate from the multiagency review of the measure. Do you have an update on that multiagency review?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we've discussed in here, this is a review that agencies are working on together as they evaluate what impact this law would have on programs that are funded by the federal government. The White House has been a part of that review. The Department of Justice has been a part of that review. But all of that has been separate from the Department of Justice conclusion that they needed to take action to enforce the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And what has been concluded as a result of that effort is that the administration will not take action to withhold funding while this enforcement process is playing out in the courts.\nSo these are two separate actions that the government is taking, one sort of questioning, evaluating this policy question about what impact the law has on funding, but also, separately, the Department of Justice has been engaged in a process of enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And while those are two separate processes, it is clear that the decision on the part of the Department of Justice to move forward with enforcement means that, while the process plays out, the administration will not be taking action to withhold funding.\nQ: Have you given the state of North Carolina a heads-up prior to this briefing that they will not withhold federal funding as a result of that statute?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there's been regular communication with state officials in North Carolina from a variety of agencies, but I can't speak to the details of any of those conversations.\nQ: In addition to the review of the North Carolina law, at least four agencies are also reviewing Mississippi's religious freedom law that seems to enable anti-LGBT discrimination. Has the same determination been made with respect to that law that there will be no withholding of federal funds as a result of that statute?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll check with my colleagues here about the status of that. I'm not aware that the Department of Justice has notified the state of Mississippi of any potential enforcement actions as a result of that law, at least at this point. But I'll see if I can get you some more specific guidance on that.\nQ: And what would you say to critics who would say that by saying you're not going to withhold funding until the issue is resolved in the courts, that the administration is not putting its full force in support of equal rights?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has been quite outspoken in making clear that this is a question of values, and when it comes to fighting for justice and fairness and fighting against discrimination, that's something the President is committed to and he's made that a priority. And I think the value statement that the President has offered with regard to this law has been clear.\nBut, look, as it relates to the more narrow question about the need to enforce the Civil Rights Act, I think the Attorney General has been quite clear about the priorities for enforcement that she has laid out and what impact that has on some people in North Carolina who right now might be feeling like the state government, at least, is not sufficiently committed to ensure equal treatment under the law.\nSo I found the Attorney General's words to be quite powerful. And as a native North Carolinian, she had a unique perspective on the situation. So I think anybody who doubts that should take a minute to review her remarks.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Back on the top story today, this meeting between Paul Ryan and Donald Trump and the chaos we've sort of seen playing out in the Republican Party. Yesterday, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz told reporters that Democrats, after their primary, essentially wouldn't have the same thing happen, that they would be unified, there wouldn't be this divisiveness at the convention. But many supporters of Senator Sanders have said that they won't vote for Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. And, at the same time, they're also saying that -- he's saying that if she comes out on top, it's not really his responsibility to get his supporters behind her. And so the President, as the highest-ranking Democrat, he is the leader of the Democratic Party. I'm wondering what the President is going to do to bring the Democratic Party together when his primary -- his party's primary ends here very soon.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President will be making a case not just to Democrats but to independents and Republicans across the country that they should support the presidential candidate who understands the progress that we've made over the last seven or eight years. And the President has been focused on implementing a strategy in the face of extreme Republic obstruction to focus on making economic investments that expand economic opportunity for the middle class. The President has been focused on trying to use diplomacy to advance our interests around the world. And at every step of the way, we've seen Republicans try to block it. And I think that gives you a good sense of where the priorities are not just of this President but of the Democratic Party.\nAnd he'll make that case not just to Democratic voters but to voters all across the country, because the question facing voters will be whether or not they -- whether they support a candidate who is committed to building on that progress -- because there certainly is more work to be done. There's additional work, there's additional progress we need to make. But we're not going to move this country forward by electing a president who is committed to tearing down the strategy that has been so critical to our success over the last several years.\nQ: Well, Republicans found themselves in this position, though, because they were unprepared, essentially, for the primary to have ended so quickly, to have to deal with Donald Trump as the nominee, that sort of thing. So I guess what I'm asking is, what would the President specifically do to bring the two candidates together, the two candidates' supporters together? We saw today, for instance, that Reince Priebus had this meeting on Capitol Hill for them. Would the President be willing to have some sort of meeting here for the two Democratic candidates -- that sort of thing?\nQ: A beer summit?\nMR. EARNEST: Perhaps.\nWell, again, I certainly am not a high qualified analyst when it comes to -- nor highly paid, as James points out -- (laughter) -- when it comes to analyzing the challenges facing the Republican Party. I would just observe that it's not just a matter of timing that has made it more complicated for them to try to paper over the breaches in that party.\nSo, look, I feel confident that the President will have a strong argument to make in the fall about who he believes should succeed him in the Oval Office, and the President will root that argument in the need to build on the progress that we've made thus far. And the President has been deeply invested in that progress and the President believes that there is more that we can do to invest in the middle class, there is more that we can do to make our tax code fairer, there is more that we can do to strengthen our alliances and advance our interests around the world. And the President is committed to supporting a presidential candidate that is interested in building on that progress.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back to China and steel. Today, the bipartisan leaders of the Congressional Steel Caucus requested a meeting with the President to talk about illegal steel imports. Would the President be willing to meet with them?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that request. We'll obviously take a close look at it. I think that, again, the fact that the President spent some time with the Prime Minister of Australia talking about this issue I think should be a clear indication to you and to the members of the bipartisan Steel Caucus that this is an issue that the President believes is an important priority for our country and for our economy.\nQ: And also they also want to discuss whether China should be recognized as having market economy status at the WTO. Has the administration weighed in on that?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a discussion that they should have with the Commerce Department, because the Commerce Department is the one who considers that determination.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, on the Nordic summit, I know you mentioned climate change. Is there anything concrete that you hope will come out of it? And these are countries that are also part of the anti-ISIL coalition. Are they doing enough in that? Would the President like to see them contribute more? Are they spending enough on their militaries? And are they doing enough in the refugee crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't want to talk about any concrete announcements a day before the leaders even arrive, so we can talk about that a little bit more tomorrow. As it relates to our counter-ISIL efforts, we certainly spend a lot of time talking to our coalition partners about additional steps that they could take to enhance our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. So I'm confident that that will be part of the discussion.\nWe know that a number of these countries have generously taken in refugees that are fleeing violence in the Middle East, and I would anticipate that the President will have a discussion with them about the impact that that has had on their country's individual politics, but also to encourage them as they offer up that much-needed humanitarian relief.\nWhen it comes to climate change, this obviously is an issue that the United States and the Nordic countries have been able to work effectively together on in a variety of ways. But stay tuned tomorrow for any announcements.\nMike.\nQ: Will the President be meeting with victims of Agent Orange while he's in Vietnam?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that this afternoon the President's National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, is meeting with a group of veteran service organizations, leaders of veteran service organizations and other veterans to talk about the President's trip to Vietnam and Japan. And she will make clear that, in addition to discussing some of the issues that I outlined with Margaret related to TPP and our economic relationship with Asia that she'll also spend some time talking to them about getting a full accounting of POWs and MIAs in Vietnam. This is obviously a priority for many of these organizations, and it's certainly a priority for the Commander-in-Chief.\nAs it relates to the Agent Orange situation, I'm not aware that the President has any specific meetings planned with victims of Agent Orange. But obviously our veterans organizations that advocate for America's veterans are concerned about this issue, and the President is certainly interested in making sure that our veterans get the benefits that they deserve.\nQ: Also on the trip to Asia, not surprisingly, in your readout of the call to Turnbull last night, you mentioned TPP as one of the subjects. This will be the first trip to Asia since Trump has essentially clinched the Republican nomination, so we now have both the Democratic frontrunner, as you know, and the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump, against TPP. And Trump, in his recent campaigning, has very much focused on trade, including retaliation against companies that would outsource to places like Asia -- in the Indiana primary. In the conversations with the counterparties in Asia to TPP, what sort of -- have they been concerned by the fact that either of his successors will be opposed to the treaty? And what have you been telling them, given that the Congress is dragging its feet on being interested in ratifying this and now we have Democrats and Republicans more and more against it going into the convention? What have they been telling you?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this isn't a surprising development. We saw on the campaign trail for the presidential candidates in both parties that there was not strong support for TPP. That was true last year at this time. But yet, we did succeed, despite that opposition, in advancing Trade Promotion Authority legislation through the Congress. And we did that by painstakingly avoiding some snafus that Jordan referred to, and passing in bipartisan fashion legislation that actually succeed in allowing us to complete those negotiations.\nSo those in other countries that are carefully watching our political system I think understand that there continues to be bipartisan support in the Congress for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and we have succeeded in navigating the cross-currents of the presidential election in building bipartisan support for those kinds of agreements.\nSo we did that last year with Trade Promotion Authority, and we're confident that we'll be able to do that this year when it comes to implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nI think the last observation I would make -- and this, I think, should be a pretty forceful argument for members of Congress who are supportive of TPP and wondering when they should vote on it. I mean, I'd just make the observation that it is very, very unlikely that the next President will be more enthusiastic about TPP than this President. So I think that would be a reason for Congress to take action before this President resigns.\nQ: And more directly, has the counterparties' anxiety about its potential modification increased in recent months in your conversations with them? And is it affecting alternative arrangements they might be thinking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. You could probably get a better read on this from Ambassador Furman's office. He obviously spends more time interacting with the counterparties. But I think most of the parties that we've been dealing with in the context of these negotiations understand the political debate in this country. They understand why the politics of the situation are particularly challenging. But I don't think they've learned anything new that they didn't already know six months or a year ago. The truth is we've been having this conversation with the TPP parties for five or six years now, so they understand the political dynamics here.\nBut the President certainly feels a sense of urgency in working with Democrats and Republicans to see the Trans-Pacific Partnership get implemented.\nI'll do a couple in the back here. John Bennett.\nQ: Senators Warren and Murray have announced a $1.1 billion agreement on an emergency Zika bill. Is the White House satisfied? That's almost a billion dollars beneath your request. Are you satisfied with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we put forward the request that we would like to see, and it obviously had a lot of details in it. That request was forwarded to Congress back in February. So we certainly would have liked to have seen more prompt congressional action on this. I think, frankly, at this point, given the delays and given the heightened stakes, we welcome any sort of forward momentum in Congress.\nAs it relates to the specific package you just mentioned, we'll have to take a close look at it to see if it's sufficient. But Congress has -- I made a reference earlier to the frustrations associated with the slow-moving Congress, and look, it could not be clearer that Congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus. That is critical to the public health and safety of the American people, and it cannot be done -- we can't do everything we need to do to prepare for this virus without congressional action.\nSo as I mentioned yesterday, this is an emergency. It's an emergency now. That's not just my observation, that's the observation of Democratic and Republican governors across the country. It's an observation that's been made by our public professionals. So this isn't about politics; this is about solving problems. And we need Congress to act quickly so we can get to work solving this problem.\nQ: I talked to some experts about the Nordic visit, and they said their impression is the President has really come to respect the Nordic leaders for their pragmatism and kind of a get-things-done attitude. Can you talk a little bit about that? How did that develop over his presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has had an opportunity in a variety of settings to meet with the leaders of these countries, and the observation that the President typically makes about the Nordic countries -- he uses a rather colorful expression -- he describes them as \"punching above their weight.\" And look, these are relatively small countries, but they are countries that make an impactful contribution to our efforts on a variety of issues.\nWe certainly value the contribution that each of these countries has made to fighting carbon pollution. We value the contribution that each of these countries have made to the counter-ISIL coalition. Three of these countries -- Norway, Iceland and Denmark -- are full NATO members, but event Sweden and Finland have a relationship with NATO that allows them to coordinate their activities closely with NATO. So all of them are making a substantial contribution to what we have described as the cornerstone of American national security, which is NATO.\nSo the President is looking forward to hosting them at the White House, repaying the hospitality that he enjoyed last year. And he's looking forward to I think a pretty busy day of meetings on a variety of issues.\nJohn, I give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two brief questions. Number one, you mentioned Mr. Trump. He recently said he would appoint former Mayor Giuliani to chair a special commission on Muslims and on terrorism. And does one think that that would be a good idea in terms of vetting people who can come into the country and would be threats, and letting those who are no threat and just seek refuge come in?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, we actually have a very well-established process for considering individuals who want to enter the country through the refugee process. Refugees, regardless of the way that they worship, are processed through a system that carefully vets their background, collects information from those individuals in in-person interviews, collects biometric information that is then run through a variety of databases maintained by law enforcement, by our national security agencies, by intelligence agencies. In fact, people who enter the United States through the refugee program are subject to more scrutiny than anybody else that comes in the country.\nSo that's a well-established process, and that's the one that President Obama has ensured that our national security agencies are carefully adhering to.\nQ: So you don't think a Giuliani commission is needed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've got a well-established process. And I'll let the presidential candidates make whatever proposals they want.\nQ: The other thing I wanted to ask was, the Philippines elected a new president on Monday, and there's been more talk of a stronger U.S. tie to the Philippines, in part because of some dangers in that part of the world. Will the President ever discuss with President Duterte, President-elect Duterte, the reopening of the Clark airbase, the Subic naval base, or at the very least, the restoration of the Filipino-American holiday that was abolished by one of his predecessors, Corazon Aquino?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President had the opportunity to visit the Philippines last year. He spent about four days in Manila, and spoke with his then-counterpart, President Aquino, on a range of issues. And there was a discussion about deepening the security relationship between the United States and the Philippines.\nObviously, the Philippines has a counterterrorism threat that they have to deal with, and the United States has been supportive of their efforts to confront that threat. Obviously, the Philippines has some concerns about claims that China has made in the South China Sea, and we have strongly supported the Filipino effort to press the Chinese to resolve those differences through diplomacy.\nThe Filipinos also have a challenge when it comes to maritime security. And there is expertise and equipment that the United States has provided the Filipino government to confront that challenge. Those of you who were there will remember that the President visited a vessel that has previously been owned by the United States that is now being operated by the equivalent of the Filipino coast guard there to provide security in the Philippines.\nSo that's an indication of the strong relationship what we already have with the Philippines, and the President would certainly be open to not just continuing but actually deepening that security relationship with President-elect Duterte once his election results have been confirmed officials.\nQ: And that would include possibly the reopening of those two bases and the restoration --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that there's any policy decision that's been made with regard to that, with regard to any of those bases. What we have said is that we're interested in an important national security-counterterrorism relationship with the Philippines that enhances the national security of both of our countries. And I'm confident that conversation will continue with the next President, whether it's Mr. Duterte or someone else.\nQ: So the President has not called Mr. Duterte?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I believe the results of the election -- while the election took place several days ago, I have not seen official results from the election be announced at this point. So I know that there are a bunch of projections out there, but I don't know of any official pronouncement that's been made.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Taka, I know that you've been trying to get a question the last couple of days. So why don't I give you the last chance here?\nQ: So on Japan, can you tell me if -- how the President will mention or talk about Nagasaki when he goes to Hiroshima?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry. Can you say that one more time?\nQ: Can you say if and how the President will talk about Nagasaki?\nMR. EARNEST: I see. Yes, at this point, I don't have much to say about the President's remarks that he'll deliver at Hiroshima. The President does not intend to deliver a major address while he's at Hiroshima. I think that will be an opportunity for him in a rather solemn place to share his reflections on having the opportunity to visit this sight. He will also have an opportunity to talk about the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship and make an observation about the profound transformation in that relationship just in the space of 70 years or so.\nAnd while, on one hand, you might say 70 years is a long time, it's a lifetime. On the other hand, 70 years ago, the United States and Japan were at war. And the way that we cooperate now on such a wide range of issues that enhances importantly the national security of both our countries I think is a testament to the tremendous progress that's been made in both our countries. And I think it's served both our countries and citizens in both of our countries quite well. And the President will have an opportunity to make that observation not just when he's in Hiroshima but during his visit to Japan.\nQ: Will he have any message to the people in Nagasaki?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Any message to the people --\nMR. EARNEST: The message. At this point, we'll wait for the President's remarks before we make any observation.\nAll right, thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:28 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-05-12", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Bernie Sanders on Thursday came to this Oglala Lakota reservation to put a spotlight on poverty and to detail proposals to create jobs, raise wages and reduce growing wealth and income inequality in America.\n\"There is a lot of pain in the community,\" Sanders told a forum that focused on poverty, inadequate health care and schools. \"We've got a lot of work to do but nothing ever good happens if people give up. You've got to stand up and be involved in the political process.\"\n\"The reason we are here today is to try to understand what is going on in Pine Ridge and other reservations,\" Sanders said. \"There are a lot of problems here. Poverty is much too high. There are not enough decent jobs in the area. The health care system is inadequate. And we need to fundamentally change the relationship between the U.S. government and the Native American community.\"\nThe reservation sprawls across three counties that are among the poorest in the United States. Forty-nine percent of residents in Pine Ridge live below the poverty line including 61 percent of those under the age of 18. Per capita annual income is just $6,286. The infant mortality rate on the reservation is five times greater than the national average. Life expectancy is just 48 years for men and 52 for women. The high school dropout rate is 70 percent and the teacher turnover rate is eight times the national average.\n\"In America today, we have a massive level of income and wealth inequality. We are living in a country where some people have unbelievable wealth but a lot of other people are living in dire poverty,\" Sanders said.\nHe called for a federal jobs program to put millions of people back to work. He has introduced legislation to create 13 million good-paying jobs by investing $1 trillion in repairing the nation's crumbling roads, bridges, water systems, schools and other infrastructure projects.\nSanders also said the federal minimum wage should go up. \"In America today, many people are working for wages that are much too low. That is why we have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,\" he said.\nTold that the Indian Health Service is a \"failure,\" Sanders called for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care as a right for all Americans. He also said he would lower sky-high prices for prescription drugs and push for tuition-free public colleges and universities.\nSpeaking at the site of the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890, Sanders said the United States and Native Americans must develop \"a new relationship.\" He added, \"We owe a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.\"", "timestamp": "2016-05-12", "title": "Press Release - Sanders at Pine Ridge Reservation Calls for 'New Relationship' with Native Americans"}

I fully expect that today's decision will be reversed.\n\"The last eight years have proven that Republicans have no interest in universal health care. Instead they have tried time and time again to take health care away from the 20 million newly insured Americans. We should be talking about how to make health care a right for all Americans, not finding new ways to make health care unaffordable.\n\"Instead of gutting the Affordable Care Act, we need to expand on the improvements that it has made to our health care system.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117431", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:24 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Friday. Glad it's finally here. I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKathleen, would you like to start?\nQ: Sure. Thank you. I'm going to start with the administration's letter on transgender bathroom guidance for schools.\nMR. EARNEST: I thought you might.\nQ: I thought I'd give you a chance to respond to Texas's – the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, who said that the letter -- he called the letter \"blackmail,\" and said that the administration is doing everything it can to -- or he said it's going to divide the country and it has everything to do with keeping the federal government out of local issues.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to a statewide elected office. So let's just walk through the facts here. The first is, this was guidance that was issued by the Department of Education and the Department of Justice in response to requests for information and guidance from school administrators across the country.\nJust last week, for example, the National Association of Secondary School Principals put forward a specific formal request to the Department of Education about how to create the kind of respectful, inclusive environment that school administrators across the country are seeking to maintain. These principals also are interested in making sure that they're acting consistent with the law. And they sought guidance because they're not interested in a political argument, they're actually interested in practical suggestions about how they confront this challenge that they face every day.\nSo let's just be clear about what's included in the guidance. The guidance does not add additional requirements to the applicable law. The guidance does not require any student to use shared facilities when schools make alternate arrangements. But what the framework does provide is advice for how school administrators can protect the dignity and safety of every student under their charge. And that advice includes practical, tangible, real-world suggestions to school administrators who have to deal with this issue. They can't rely on political arguments that are framed as a solution to a problem that nobody can prove exists. They actually have to deal with the responsibility that they have to promote an inclusive, respectful environment for all of their students.\nAnd what the Department of Education has issued today is specific, tangible, real-world advice and suggestions to school administrators across the country about exactly they can do that.\nQ: But you wouldn't argue -- or it seems as though the administration is also trying to paint this as a major civil rights issue, right? This isn't just a pragmatic sort of everyday guidance to schools. Attorney General Lynch has compared this to racial segregation.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think Attorney General Lynch was talking about a very specific enforcement action that the Department of Education announced -- or the Department of Justice announced with regard to a specific law that was passed by the state of North Carolina. In this instance, this is not an enforcement action. As I pointed out, this does not add any additional requirements to any school district or state under the applicable law. This is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for information and advice that have been put forward by school administrators and teachers and, in some cases, even parents who are seeking practical solutions to this challenge.\nAnd the challenge here is not to isolate anybody, it's not to discriminate against anybody, it's not to make anybody unsafe -- it's actually to ensure that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they can possibly be. And that's why the guidance that we've put forward includes tangible, specific suggestions for how that can be achieved.\nSo let me just give you one example. There are some school districts across the country that have sought to enhance the privacy of their students by making relatively minor changes to shared-use facilities. In some cases, that means just putting up curtains so that people have more privacy when they're changing their clothes or taking showers in what had previously been shared-use facilities. So that is something that benefits all students, and that's what we're looking for -- solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in the school.\nQ: And if schools individually decide not to follow this guidance, there isn't a threat that they could lose federal funding --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, if there are schools -- first of all, let me just state that it is my strongly held belief -- and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be right about this -- that the vast majority of schools and school districts and school administrators across the country will welcome this guidance and will implement it. For those that don't, there's an established process for them to raise any concerns that they may have. And there's an established process for that, and we'll go through it. But the vast majority of schools and school administrators will incorporate this advice as they confront the challenge of ensuring that they're promoting the kind of respectful, safe learning environment that can ensure the success of all of their students.\nQ: Okay, and I'm going to just switch topics. Chairman Rogers is saying he's put together a Zika measure -- and he didn't put a dollar figure amount, but it's safe to say it's going to be well under what you all have asked, even under the Senate, of $1.1 trillion [sic]. So are you willing to accept $1.1 trillion? Is that enough money to fight Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I haven't seen the details related to Chairman Rogers's proposal. I think what I would encourage him to do before he puts it forward -- I don't know if he has yet -- but if he hasn't, if there's still time, he should consult with the public health professionals that the administration talked to in putting forward our funding request for what is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. Time's a-wastin'. And you saw that from the graphic that we presented in the briefing earlier this week. As the weather warms up, as the mosquito population grows, the risk to pregnant women and their babies all across the country grows.\nAnd so it's long past time for people like Chairman Rogers, who's got a substantial responsibility here -- he's the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee -- when our public health professionals say that they need resources to protect the American people, they're looking exactly at Chairman Rogers to see exactly what he's doing. And here we are, three months after the administration has put forward our proposal, that he comes forward with a much smaller one that is inconsistent with the recommendations of our public health professionals. It's also inconsistent of the request that was put forward by Democratic and Republican governors from across the country who said that they needed urgent congressional action to provide the necessary resources to keep the American people safe.\nSo before that proposal is put forward, I would encourage the Chairman to consult with governors who are responsible for the safety of the citizens of their state and the public health professionals who have taken a look at this, and understand exactly what can be done and what should be done to ensure the safety and security of the American people, and particularly pregnant women and their babies.\nRoberta.\nQ: Hezbollah's top military commander has been killed, and I'm wondering, does the administration have any understanding of who was responsible for that, and any comment on what impact this may have on the group?\nMR. EARNEST: I've certainly seen reports that Mustafa Badreddine was killed this week in Syria. And we noted the fact that preparations are underway for his funeral. Badreddine was Hezbollah's top military commander. In June of 2011, a special tribunal for Lebanon charged him with the 2005 attack that killed former Prime Minister Hariri. In September of 2012, the United States imposed sanctions against Hezbollah leaders, including Bedreddine, in part to expose Hezbollah's support for the Assad regime and its role in conducting indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Syria and Lebanon.\nWe've noted that the Syrian regime and Hezbollah have a long military alliance, and Hezbollah leaders have previously sought safe haven in Syria and have even routed weapons from Iran into Lebanon. So the interplay between the Assad regime and Hezbollah has been well chronicled.\nSo we've seen the reports of his death. I can't independently confirm them. And I guess the thing that I can confirm is that there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft in the area where he was reported to be killed. But I can't further confirm the reports.\nQ: Can you speak to what impact the U.S. feels this will have on the group and its activities?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that the Assad regime relied heavily on Hezbollah for military support in the ongoing chaos inside of Syria. The Assad regime, and President Assad himself, has personally benefitted from the activities that Hezbollah has carried out, so it's hard for me to draw any firm conclusions about what operational impact this would have. But obviously the concerns that we've previously expressed about Hezbollah I think are consistent with our ongoing efforts to reduce the violence inside of Syria and get all of the parties, including the Assad regime, to abide by the ceasefire. Those are our priorities because we want to try to bring about a political solution to the chaos inside of Syria.\nQ: On the school bathroom issue, how concerned is the administration about the legal challenges? The Texas attorney general is saying that this oversteps the administration's constitutional authority. And can you speak to -- I mean, you said very clearly to Kathleen that you expect the vast majority of schools will implement the guidance. But for those that don't, what happens with them? Is the administration actively going to follow up with them and punish them in some way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's an established process for schools and the Department of Education to discuss guidance that they've been provided. I just want to reiterate -- and this is important for people who are interested in the legal aspect of this -- there's no additional requirement under the applicable law that's being imposed on schools. There's just not, despite the claims of political opponents of the administration.\nThere is a strong desire on the part of some politicians to try and score some cheap political points by presenting a solution to a problem that they can't prove exists. And what the administration has tried to do is to provide, at the request of school administrators, practical, real-world advice they can use in their school communities to address this challenge. That's the practical offering that we have put forward here.\nIt's a lot different than the argument that others are making. For example, is the Texas attorney general suggesting somehow that it would be practical to station a law enforcement officer outside of every public bathroom in an educational facility and check people's birth certificates on the way in? That doesn't sound like a practical application to me. It also doesn't sound like small government to me. It certainly sounds like a government intrusion to me. But, again, that's what's hard to sift through in all of this. What exactly is the practical argument or suggestion that they're making?\nI recognize that they've got some sharp political arguments that were honed over years of morning drive-time radio in Houston, but school administrators don't have the benefit of just talking. They actually have a functional responsibility to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school. And the vast majority of school administrators take that responsibility quite seriously. And I think we'll welcome and implement the guidance that's been issued by the Department of Education today.\nWe'll move around. Gregory.\nQ: A lot of times when a guidance or regulation or directive comes from a federal agency, it's portrayed as a White House action. Could you address what this transgender bathroom issue -- did this come from the White House? Was the White House consulted? How unitary is the unitary executive on things like this? I guess what I'm asking is, is the White House and the Obama administration synonymous, for all intents and purposes, to --\nMR. EARNEST: Putting forward guidance like this is the responsibility of the Department of Education. And they have to consider a broad range of policy implications for schools all across the country. So this is the responsibility of the Department of Education, but you would expect the White House to be responsible for coordinating policy decisions that are made by agencies.\nSo of course the White House was aware of the policy deliberations that have been underway at the Department of Education for quite some time, but ultimately this is the responsibility and the function of the Department of Education, and they are the ones who received requests from schools all across the country, and they are the ones who are putting forward guidance for how schools can deal with this particular situation.\nRon.\nQ: What is the rationale that the administration has come to, to base this guidance on Title IX, just to be clear about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm happy to be overruled by an attorney at the Department of Justice or the Department of Education that you can consult after this hearing -- or after this briefing, but let me try.\nMy understanding is that Title IX applies specifically to preventing sex discrimination in educational institutions. And the idea that individuals are discriminated against because of their gender identity is the basis for the guidance that we're putting forward. Nobody should be discriminated against because of who they are. And our suggestion is that the rules should apply to everybody equally, and that's the basis of this guidance -- that every student should have access to facilities that every other student has access to. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are. And that's the basis for this guidance.\nThat's also why we say no student is forced to use shared facilities. And if there are alternate facilities available, that are made available by administrators, then every student should have access to those as well.\nQ: But why shouldn't local communities be making these very intimate decisions? How does the federal government know what's best in so many different communities where there are different cultural sensitivities? Why is this not a local matter?\nMR. EARNEST: It is a local matter. That is exactly the position of the Obama administration.\nQ: But why is the federal government involved?\nMR. EARNEST: The federal government is providing specific suggestions based on examples that we've collected from across the country. And the guidance is presented -- it is not an additional requirement under the applicable law. It doesn't provide any obligation to a student, for example, to use a shared facility. Rather, what it does is we have consulted with schools all across the country and surfaced good suggestions, good examples -- in some cases, even best practices -- for addressing this situation. That's the essence of guidance that's at the essence of the coordinating role that the Department of Education plays. At the same time, Ron, there's a long history in our country of the federal government playing a very important role in ensuring that people aren't discriminated against.\nQ: With regard to the health care law and the new rule, what's different? How does this apply to the transgender community specifically now? What's different?\nMR. EARNEST: So this is a good example of what I was just talking about. There is a new rule that is part of the Affordable Care Act, or the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, gender identity, age or disability, and it ensures that individuals with limited English proficiency can access language assistance when they're seeking health care.\nAgain, a basic responsibility of the federal government -- and this has been true throughout our nation's history -- is ensuring that people aren't discriminated against. And that's particularly true when it comes to health care as well. And that's true of any potential sex discrimination, but that also is relevant to discrimination that could be targeted at people because of their race, because of a perceived disability, because somebody is pregnant, because somebody doesn't speak English very well. We believe people should be treated the same and afforded the same kind of opportunities, regardless of these specific individual characteristics.\nQ: Isn't the mention of transgender patients -- isn't that specific? Isn't that new? Isn't that different?\nMR. EARNEST: All of what I've laid out is a new part of the rule that's been issued today.\nQ: What was the harm, in terms of the transgender community? Was there some identifiable problem out there that required this clarification or this augmentation to the rule?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ron, this is much broader than just applying to the transgender community. But the transgender community is included. In the same way that we want to prevent discrimination against pregnant women, we want to make sure that we're preventing discrimination against transgendered women. In the same way that we're preventing discrimination against people who don't speak English very well or people who have a specific disability, we want to make sure that transgendered men are not discriminated against either.\nQ: Specifically because there's some concern in that community about access to transition drugs and medications and services, was that something that the administration was concerned about in terms of trying to, I guess you could say, refine this rule?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess in terms of the way that it has an impact on individual health care decisions, I'd refer you to Health and Human Services for answering that question. But, look, the idea behind this specific rule is to prevent discrimination against a wide range of groups.\nQ: One other area. There are these reports about immigration raids that are supposedly happening during May. You've heard even Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders comment on this. There's the belief that the administration is going to conduct huge raids during May and June, rallying up significant numbers of women and children, recent people who have crossed the country in significant numbers. Is that true? Is there something different happening now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is an excellent question. We're talking about a DHS enforcement action, so there are some limitations about what I can say, but let me help you understand exactly the policy that DHS is implementing. And I think I can largely answer your question.\nThe first is -- and this is something that Secretary Johnson himself has said -- that the operations that are underway are merely the continuation of operations that were announced in January and in March. And those operations are conducted under the rubric of the guidance that President Obama and Secretary Johnson put in place in November of 2014. And that is guidance that made a priority of individuals who are convicted criminals or otherwise a threat to public safety, or individuals who were apprehended after crossing the border after January 1st of 2014.\nSo we've made clear that our priorities are people who pose a threat to the community, people who are convicted criminals, or people who have only recently crossed the border. So those priorities remain in place, and those priorities are followed even as these operations continue.\nLet me say two more things. The first is, no one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief. People are given access to due process. And that is a foundational principle for all of this. So the only people who are the targets of these operations are people who are subject to an order by an immigration court for removal and people who have also, in addition to being subject to that order, have exhausted any potential claims that they have for humanitarian relief.\nThe last thing is DHS enforcement agents also follow what I understand is to be longstanding guidance that ensures that these operations are not conducted in sensitive places. These operations are not conducted in schools or hospitals or places of worship, for example.\nQ: So is there no reason to fear that the numbers of deportations aren't going to increase or spike -- whatever words you want to use now -- because there's something, a specific operation underway that's different from what's normally happening there along the border?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, what Secretary Johnson has described is that the operations that are underway now are a continuation of operations that were previously announced.\nBut look, I think we would anticipate that the deportation numbers would continue to go up. This administration is serious about enforcing the law. And I recognize that our political opponents don't like to acknowledge that fact. But we've made clear how we're going to use law enforcement resources to enhance or border security and to enhance the security of communities across the country. Most importantly, we're going to enforce our laws.\nAnd this is something that President Obama is committed to. And the truth is, we would have a whole lot more resources to do exactly that if Republicans in the House of Representatives had not blocked comprehensive immigration reform legislation that did include an historic investment in our border security. But we do not enjoy the benefits of that border security today because House Republicans blocked the passage of that legislation.\nQ: And just lastly, it's not your political opponents -- well, some of the people who are objecting to this or raising concerns about this are Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, who I wouldn't think you'd consider political opponents.\nMR. EARNEST: No, but it's our political opponents who suggest that President Obama is not interested in enforcing the law. And I think that is demonstrably false. That's that point that I'm making. That's the reason that we're having this conversation right now.\nAnita. Oh, Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nQ: That's okay. She was here yesterday.\nMR. EARNEST: She was. It's nice to see you, Leslie.\nQ: That's fine, thanks. I had a couple questions on the gender guidelines you sent out last night. Given that North Carolina's House Bill 2, that's sort of part of this, is headed to the courts, why did the White House feel the need to put out this directive to the law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a directive that is responsive to requests that we've received all across the country from school administrators and teachers and parents and others. So this is not a response to the ongoing legal dispute related to HB2. This is a response to requests that the Department of Education has received from teachers and administrators all across the country.\nQ: But you've cautioned before about being careful of not putting your finger on the scale. Doesn't this sort of suggest that you're putting the White House's finger on the scale?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've been quite clear about the need to keep enforcement actions separate from any sort of political interference. This is not an enforcement action. This is a policy decision that was made by the Department of Education. And, yes, the White House was appropriately involved in coordinating that policy decision. But ultimately it's the responsibility of the Department of Education to make this policy decision and to communicate it to the schools and administrators all across the country.\nNotably, it's not an enforcement action. It does not add a requirement to the applicable law. And it doesn't pose any requirements on students for the use of shared facilities.\nQ: One of the other questions I had for you. You mentioned -- you were asked about the lieutenant governor's comments on it, and you said that it runs the risk -- or it underscores the risk of electing a right-wing radio host.\nMR. EARNEST: To statewide office, yes.\nQ: Yes, to statewide office. Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. (Laughter.)\nQ: Given that the White House last year when the Supreme Court ruled on same-sex marriage, the White House put the lights out on the fountain, how much of this was a political consideration in doing these guidelines?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think as I pointed out before, the guidelines contain practical advice and suggestions for school administrators across the country that have to deal with this challenge inside their communities. They don't have the luxury of relying on political arguments that are an attempt to try to score some political points that propose to address a solution to a problem that doesn't actually exist. These are school administrators who are trying to do the right thing. They're trying to promote an atmosphere of dignity and security for the students and their schools. And so what the Department of Education has put forward are practical suggestions for how exactly they can do that consistent with civil rights law.\nQ: And the White House is not looking to score any political points on it, even though it's been hailed by a number of organizations as a new frontier in same-sex law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not surprised to hear that there are people who agree that we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they are. I think most Americans agree with that notion. So that's part of why I anticipate that school administrators across the country would welcome this guidance.\nLook, I'll also say, I think school administrators across the country who don't agree with the politics of this administration will also welcome these suggestions, because they recognize that they have a challenge that they have to deal with and that, frankly, they don't have the luxury of engaging in a partisan political argument with a right-wing radio host. In fact, what they have to do is they have to provide for the safety and dignity of the students who are under their care. And that's exactly what this guidance does, is it gives them some useful tools for considering a range of options that they can use to do exactly that.\nSo this has very little to do with politics, except for our critics who want to make this entirely about politics. This administration is interested in providing workable, practical solutions to school administrators who are trying to provide for the safety and dignity of the students under their care.\nThanks, Leslie. Mark.\nQ: Josh, is it the intention of the administration that the guidance letter be seen as a threat to deny federal funds to school districts that don't comply with the policy decisions as interpreted by DOE and DOJ?\nMR. EARNEST: No, they should not view it that way. They should view this as guidance, as specific suggestions and a framework for dealing with a very straightforward challenge: How do school administrators, all across the country, ensure that they're protecting both the safety and dignity of every single student at the school. It's as simple as that. And what the Department of Education has done is they've drawn on their own internal expertise, and they've drawn on the creative solutions that have been implemented by school administrators all across the country to put all that good information in one place and provide some practical advice to school administrators who are trying to solve this problem. And that's a good thing.\nI think what is true, what is undeniably true is the foundation of this guidance is the principle that people shouldn't be discriminated against just because of who they are. And school administrators don't have a glamorous job. These are individuals who, I think in most cases, feel quite passionate about their work. They view their work as a calling. They're looking to prepare the next generation of Americans to succeed. And they want to create a learning environment where every student can feel safe, where every student can feel included, where every student can feel respected. That's what the vast majority of school administrators are interested in, and that's why I think the vast majority of school administrators are going to use this guidance, they're going to carefully consider the suggestions that have been put forward by the Department of Education, and they're going to put forward a solution that works in their community. That's the way this should work.\nQ: Could you see how some might see the guidance letter as an implied threat of loss of federal funds, being that you mentioned that under the provisions of Title IX, schools that receive federal funds are obligated to comply with the provisions that are stated forth in the guidance letter?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there is a desire in the guidance to be as clear as possible about why this guidance is being issued. But look, it's quite clear what we're interested in here. The Department of Education is interested in providing guidance and suggestions to school administrators who are trying to do the right thing. And that right thing is to prevent people from being discriminated against, but also make sure that every single student in their school has their safety and their dignity protected.\nQ: On another issue -- do you have any further guidance on the WASPs legislation?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not. This is the bill about the --\nQ: Women Airforce Service Pilots.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the World War II women Airforce veterans -- pilots. I do not believe that we have received that from Congress yet. I don't know if we've got an update on that. But we'll be tracking that, and we'll keep you posted on that status. But the President does intend to sign it.\nQ: Right. And you said yesterday. Do you know why the President could not have, as Commander-in-Chief, directed the Army to allow a burial for these women at Arlington without legislation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know exactly how the law works. I don't know if his authority as Commander-in-Chief could have been used for that purpose. But we certainly welcomed the bipartisan legislation from Congress that would make the use of that -- or the exercise of that authority unnecessary, because Congress has passed a law making it possible.\nChris.\nQ: Thanks. Everyone is in my business today.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Everyone is in my business today. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I know, man. (Laughter.) You got to elbow those people out.\nQ: Yesterday, you said that there was a determination, as a result of multiagency review, that there would be no loss of federal funds at this time to North Carolina as a result of possible suit. But at the same time, this guidance on transgender students is issued. Isn't that sending a mixed message?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, I don't think it's a mixed message. I think it's important for people to understand what's happening here. This guidance that was put forward by the Department of Education does not impose any new requirements under the applicable law. It's guidance that's issued to school administrators in school districts all across the country.\nThe conversation that we've been having over the course of this week has largely been centered on the state of North Carolina and what impact their law could have on their compliance with the Civil Rights Act. So it was related to a specific piece of legislation that was passed almost literally in the dark of night by the legislation that convened a one-day special session to pass this bill. It was signed the same day by the governor. And the rebuke from business leaders in North Carolina and business leaders who are contemplating doing business in North Carolina has been forceful. And I think it's an indication that the legislation that was passed by the state legislature was much more -- was much broader than just something that would apply in an educational setting.\nSo the situations are quite different. I think they do illustrate how consistent and forceful this administration has been about fighting against the idea that people could be discriminated against because of who they are. That's a principle the President does feel strongly about. It's obviously a principle that Attorney General Lynch spoke movingly about. And preventing discrimination and treating people fairly is a core principle that does guide a lot of the policy that's made by the Obama administration. But the enforcement action that was announced by the Attorney General this week was enforcement action that was the decision of attorneys at the Department of Justice. That decision was not influenced by White House officials. The notification that was distributed by the Department of Education today is not an enforcement action; it was a policy decision that did include some White House involvement, but was the realm and responsibility of the Department of Education.\nQ: But nonetheless, given that the major component of House Bill 2 is that transgender students in North Carolina are prohibited from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity, doesn't that necessarily mean that even if schools not to follow this guidance that the Department of Education has put out, that they will not suffer a loss of federal funds?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what this says is -- well, the way this works is that if there are schools -- and I think they will be in the minority -- but if there are schools across the country that do come forward and indicate that they do not intend to be in compliance with this guidance, then there is an established process for litigating those differences with the Department of Education. So there's an established process for this. We don't have to invent one.\nQ: And was it planned to make the announcement that there would be no loss of federal funds for North Carolina at this time, in conjunction with the announcement from the Department of Education and Justice for this guidance for transgender students? Was that coincidental?\nMR. EARNEST: No, these were separate actions. So, again, as it relates to North Carolina in consideration of HB2, the policy decision that was made, even as agencies were considering whether or not the passage and implementation of HB2 would put a range of federally funded programs at risk in the state of North Carolina, the decision that was made was to not withhold any funding until the enforcement action that was announced by the Department of Justice had made its way through the courts. So that was a very specific thing, and that was a response to developments that occurred this week with regard to the situation in North Carolina.\nThis guidance is guidance that has been in the works for years, but it is guidance that is broadly consistent with the kinds of principles that this President and this administration has long fought for.\nQ: One last question. Even after you said yesterday, with regard to HB2, that there would be no loss of federal funds to the state as the enforcement action is ongoing in the courts, a Department of Education spokesperson said the review there is ongoing. Do you know why the spokesperson would have said that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. But this is a little complicated, so it may have just been a bit of a miscommunication. But as it relates specifically to HB2, no federal agencies will be making a decision to withhold funding as a result of HB2 until the DOJ enforcement process has worked its way through the courts.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, is this the extent of guidance like this? Or do you foresee similar directives to come from the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any other -- I mean, when you say \"like this,\" you mean guidance that could have an impact on --\nQ: Well, you said that you had received inquiries from the educational community, that you're responding to it. Have you received inquiries from other industries, companies, elsewhere, also demanding this kind of clarity on how they should be treating transgender people?\nMR. EARNEST: It's certainly possible. I'm not aware of any guidance that's likely to attract the amount of interest that this one has.\nQ: I'm going to go back to an idea you were talking about here with Kathleen. Can you just clarify: Does the President see this as a clear-cut civil rights issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there obviously is a question of civil rights here. And there is a question of how can we ensure that the civil rights of every student is protected. There's also a question of how do we ensure that the dignity and safety of every student is protected. And the guidance that we have put forward would do both. And again, I think that's why we're going to see a lot of school administrators come forward and announce their intent to implement this guidance, or they're going just going to implement the guidance without announcing it. Or, like many school administrators, they're already doing this kind of work to ensure the safety and dignity of every student at the school.\nAnd this is the thing that I was mentioning before. This is something that over the last week or two has been a pretty loud part of the political debate. But this is something that school administrators all across the country have been dealing with for quite some time. So they don't have the luxury of falling back on talking points. They've got to implement practical, real-world solutions that make a difference when it comes to the safety and dignity of students at their school. Posting a law enforcement officer outside of every bathroom, and checking the birth certificate of people who are walking through the door -- that's not a practical solution. That's not going to enhance anybody's safety. It's not going to enhance anybody's dignity. That's impractical. It's rooted in a political argument that has very little grounding in actual facts.\nSo I recognize that that is sort of something that politicians frequently do, which is make arguments that may sound good politically just to score some political points. But to do that at the expense of students all across the country is something I don't think that they should do.\nQ: And the question of civil rights, I mean, are you parsing here that it's not a civil rights issue? I mean, is this because the courts still haven't ruled on whether there is protection under the law of transgender persons as a protected class, as an extension of sex discrimination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what's undeniable is this is an issue where case law is still being built up. But, look, I think the reading of this guidance I think is pretty common-sense. You can't discriminate against people because of their gender identity. You can't force people with a specific gender identity to use a different facility. That's discriminating against them.\nWhat we should do is we should treat every student the same. We should protect every student's safety. We should protect every student's dignity. We should give every student access to individual-use facilities if that's what they prefer and they're available. That's the cornerstone here of our argument.\nQ: You're saying the case law is still being built up, but you're not going so far as to say that this is on shaky legal ground because we still haven't seen the federal protection?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't mean to telegraph any lack of confidence in the legal conclusion that's been reached here. The law is clear. And I think it should be notable that it's not just the Department of Education that signed on to this, but the Department of Justice has too.\nThe point that I'm trying to make, Margaret, is that this is something that is relatively new. This is a relatively new policy consideration that school administrators are having to make. This is a relatively new element of our political debate.\nI was thinking about Chris earlier today because there was some discussion about whether or not the word \"transgender\" had ever been uttered from the White House podium before. And I think that's a pretty apt illustration of how this debate is changing and has emerged. So it's new to our political debate, but this is not new when you consider what school administrators have had to do to ensure the safety and security of every student at their school. This is something that they have to deal with every day. And that's why most of them don't have a lot of tolerance for a bunch of cheap political rhetoric. They're looking for solutions. And solutions are exactly what were provided by the Department of Education in their letter today.\nRich.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You're saying that this is a problem that school administrators are dealing with, but then it was also a problem that didn't exist until it entered this political realm. How long has the administration been getting questions about this? And did the North Carolina law prompt this guidance or speed its timeline?\nMR. EARNEST: It did not. This is guidance that had been in the works for years. This is relatively new to our political debate, but again, this is something that has been the source of questions that the Department of Education has received for a number of years now. And again, those questions to the Department of Education were not rooted in the desire of a high school principal to make a political argument. It was rooted in the desire of a high school principal to get some advice and to rely on the experts at the Department of Education to help him or her ensure the safety and dignity of every single student at their school. That's what these principals are looking for.\nLook, in most cases, principals aren't making a whole lot of money. It's not a glamorous job. But they do it because they care deeply about our children. They care deeply about providing a good, quality education to our kids. They care deeply about the future of this country. They care deeply about ensuring that a learning environment that they are responsible for managing is one that's respectful, that's inclusive, and that is safe. And that's the kind of guidance that they were seeking from the Department of Education about how best to accomplish those goals.\nQ: Doesn't the administration think, though, or acknowledge at least, that there still is a very difficult process here? For example, the guidance says that when a student or the student's parent or guardian, as appropriate, notifies the administration that the student will assert a gender identity that differs from their previous representations, the school will begin treating that student consistent with the gender identity. And then it goes on to say the gender transition can happen swiftly or over a long duration of time. If a principal is sitting in front of a student, there could be questions of clarity, sincerity. These are all things that are still not answered and out there, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this goes to Ron's question. We acknowledge -- and, in fact, this is what should happen: School administrators do have to make decisions about the best way to protect the dignity and safety of the students at their school. And, yes, these are complicated issues, and that's setting aside even the kinds of arrangements that might be available to a school administrator. And so many of our schools are so wildly underfunded, right? So you face this question about are we going to build a new bathroom, or are we going to provide up-to-date textbooks in our science classrooms. These are practical questions that administrators are going to have to answer for themselves.\nThat's why it would not be wise for the federal government to be imposing a solution or adding an additional requirement under the law. That's, in fact, why we have not done that, because we believe in the value and the importance of local control of schools. So we want schools and we want school administrators to be reaching the kinds of conclusions and the kinds of solutions that are in the best interests of that community and that are in the best interests of the students who attend that school.\nSo that's also why you've seen the U.S. Department of Education draw upon solutions that have been implemented by schools all across the country and surfacing those good ideas and sharing them with other school administrators that are trying to solve the same problem. That's a pretty high-functioning U.S. Department of Education providing a valuable service to school administrators all across the country that are simply just trying to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment for their kids.\nQ: Lastly, the administration has come out very strongly on these issues, with the action against North Carolina, with its guidance today. And those are domestic issues. Internationally, the United States still has relationships with and gives aid to countries that puts LGBT people behind bars, charges them and executes them. Is the U.S. going to exert its influence internationally on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, I would tell you that we do. The President strongly advocates for the rights of all people when he travels around the world. And we certainly have made direct statements -- let me say it this way. The President has been crystal-clear both in public settings, but also in private settings, in his conversations with world leaders about our expectation and the priority that we place in this country on human rights.\nQ: So we threaten funding?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that that has been a question that has been discussed in a number of other settings about whether or not significant human rights violations undermine the relationship that the United States has with other countries, or in some cases, could even interrupt funding that is provided by the United States to other countries.\nThere was an amusing situation a couple of years ago where there were questions about whether or not the United States was going to interrupt the federal aid that we provide to Egypt in the aftermath of a crackdown on political dissidents there. Now, that situation is not funny, but it did provoke an amusing response here as I tried to describe the way that funding is provided to individual countries and tranches, and so some people had some fun with that.\nBut it underscores that this is a policy priority of the President when he travels around the world. I've sat in rooms where the President is talking to world leaders, and the President of the United States respectfully but directly raises concerns about the treatment of minorities in their countries, including the rights of gays and lesbians, and the rights of political dissidents, the rights of women, the rights of journalists. And, look, as a country, these are values that we are deeply invested in and we use our influence around the world to try to advance those values. And the President makes that case rather forcefully, both in public and in private, on American soil and when he's abroad.\nQ: Quickly on the guidance. Do you expect lawsuits?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, what I expect is that the vast majority of school administrators are going to take a look at this guidance and figure out a way to implement it in their schools.\nKenneth.\nQ: Josh, thank you. To follow up to the follow-up to the follow-up on the question of transgender guidance.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm summoning a lot of patience today.\nQ: Does the administration in its final months expect to issue any more guidance on topics, issues that the Education Department is dealing with? For instance, there's a hearing that happened this morning where mothers said that football slowly killed her son because of concussions. So I'm curious, are there any other directives or issues or guidance that the administration plans to give out that impacts the nation's children, like guidance on CTE?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any announcements about additional Department of Education guidance that's likely to be issued in the months ahead. You can certainly check with the Department of Education to see if they can give you a preview of what other policies they may have in store.\nQ: On Zika, back to that for a second here. You mentioned yesterday a list of things that the Republican-led Congress has not done, such as Zika, Puerto Rico, opioid addiction. Well, the House passed --\nMR. EARNEST: Passing a budget.\nQ: Passing a budget. The House passed 18 bills on opioid addiction yesterday. And on Zika, I know you mentioned that the funding is not on the current legislation that's making its way through right now. Does the President expect to pass these pieces of legislation if they reach his desk? And are you championing the bipartisan effort by the Florida senators, Rubio and Nelson, to give fully funded $1.9 billion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly welcome the bipartisan support that our Zika proposal has received, including from Senator Rubio. I think this reflects the degree to which, for all of our policy differences with Senator Rubio, when it comes to looking out for the public health and wellbeing of the American people, there shouldn't be a partisan difference. And I think Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson both understand the consequences for mothers and babies in Florida of not doing everything possible to fight Zika. So we certainly welcome that show of bipartisan support from Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson, and hope that the United States Senate and the United States House will listen to the advice of our public health experts.\nThe $1.9 billion number was not chosen at random -- it actually reflects the sum total of efforts that our public health professionals say they can and should take over the long term to protect the American people from Zika. So if there are some public health professionals in the United States Congress that have looked at this carefully enough to offer up their own alternative, they can do that. But $1.9 billion is what our public health professionals say that we need. $1.9 billion is what our bipartisan governors from all across the country believe that Congress should provide so that they can fight Zika in their communities.\nSo there's strong bipartisan support for our proposal because it's rooted in the facts, because it's rooted based on the advice of the top scientists in the country. That's why we welcome the support of Republican senators like Senator Rubio. That's why we welcome the support of Democratic and Republican governors. And we would welcome bipartisan congressional passage of some legislation that's long overdue.\nQ: But would the President sign anything less than the $1.9 billion request?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a process that, unfortunately, is still working its way through the United States Congress. We would have liked to have seen Congress begin this effort many months ago. The President convened a meeting with his national security team and his public health experts in January to discuss this issue. Just a couple of weeks later, he signaled his intent to request resources from Congress. Just a couple of weeks after that, we put forward a specific proposal that detailed how that $1.9 billion would be spent.\nSo we worked at a very rapid pace over the winter to put forward this request. Three months now have gone by, almost three months, and we've seen very little movement from Congress, and that's been quite disappointing. But maybe as people like Senator Rubio weigh in and demonstrate bipartisan support for this recommendation from our public health professionals, maybe we'll build up some momentum here.\nSuzanne.\nQ: Josh, on another issue. On the day that the President is hosting several world leaders -- the refugee crisis, it was back in September that he pledged he wanted to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country by the end of fiscal 2016, October. So you have some time, but the latest State Department statistic is showing just a little more than 2,000. Is the administration confident that you'll reach your goal of 10,000 by October? And can you also explain some of the delays and the slower-than-expected process that they've gone through? What's been some of the issues?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Suzanne, the challenge here is simply this -- that individuals who enter the United States through the refugee program are subjected to more screening, more background checks than any other individual who tries to enter the United States. These individuals have to undergo a background check, they're interviewed in person, biometric data about them is collected, and then all of that information is then run through databases that are maintained by the United States military, U.S. intelligence agencies, other national security organizations in the United States, but also law enforcement organizations in the United States and law enforcement organizations overseas.\nSo all of that work takes time. And the President was clear that we're not going to cut corners when it comes to security, even as we meet this ambitious goal. So I don't think anybody was under the expectation that there would be a linear increase in the number of refugees that would be admitted to the United States. I think we always contemplated that this is a program that would ramp up over time as we added capacity and as we added our capacity to conduct these background checks.\nSo there's no denying that there's a lot of work to do to meet this goal. It is an ambitious goal and it will be challenging to get it done. But last year around this time, there were questions raised about whether or not we would meet our previous refugee goal because we'd fallen behind pace. But yet, based on the good work of our professionals at the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security, we did succeed in meeting that goal last year. And the President has made clear that meeting the more ambitious goal this year is a top priority. And I'm confident that all the people who are working on this problem understands the priority that the President has placed on this issue.\nQ: How has the political rhetoric, the harsh language, and some of the fear that's been drummed up around immigration and around the refugee crisis impacted the administration's ability to get them through the pipeline?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think it's had an impact. The people who are working on this inside the U.S. government are professionals, and they understand exactly what needs to be done when it comes to implementing these vigorous background checks. They understand why it's important that a thorough vetting be conducted before refugees are admitted to this country. And that's what they're doing. And the political noise has not impacted their ability to do their jobs.\nQ: And just to be clear, the administration is confident it will be able to reach its goal of 10,000?\nMR. EARNEST: I am confident that the people who are operating this program understand that the President of the United States thinks this is a top priority, and they have work to do to meet this challenging goal. So we certainly intend to reach this goal.\nJanet.\nQ: Hi, Josh. Thank you. Going back to immigration, many of the critics -- immigration critics have called for refugee status for the Central American families. Will there be any action on that? And would you say that this is in correlation to the spike of Central American families crossing the border, that have been apprehended at the border in the last few months?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's not. As Secretary Johnson has indicated, the operations that are underway are a continuation of operations that were previously announced. At the same time, I do think it is important for people who are in Central America and contemplating making the dangerous journey through Mexico to try to get to the United States, these operations should make clear that that's not an option -- that's not a viable option.\nIt should also make clear to parents in particular that child smugglers who say they can sneak their kids into the United States are not telling the truth. And, in fact, entrusting your children to those smugglers is dangerous and we strongly encourage people not to do it.\nSo that's an important thing. It's important for people to understand what the policy is in the United States. It's also important for people to understand what we have tried to do. And what we have tried to do is to enhance the assistance that the United States provides to countries like Guatemala and Honduras. Last year, in the omnibus budget proposal, about $700 million was provided by Congress to improve the security situation in some of those countries or make contributions to try to improve the security situation there and try to address some of the root causes that would prompt people to undertake this dangerous journey.\nSo if this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing. But our motivation for carrying out these operations is rooted in President Obama and Secretary Johnson's commitment to enforcing the law. We're going to do that in a way that is humane. We're going to make sure that people have access to due process. The only people who would be subject to operations like this are people who are subject to an order of removal by an immigration court.\nThe only people who could be part of an operation like this and removed from the country would be people who have exhausted any sort of claims for asylum or humanitarian relief. So there are rules that govern this, but at the end of the day, the President is serious about enforcing the law. The President does continue to believe that there is a better way, and that comprehensive immigration reform legislation through Congress would improve the way that we manage our immigration system in this country.\nQ: But there is no viable way for refugee status for these Central American families?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there has been a discussion about working with the United Nations to allow people in Central America to apply for asylum and be considered, be carefully vetted for inclusion in some sort of refugee process. And we have worked diligently with the United Nations to try to get that process up and running. There's still a lot of work to do with regard to establishing that program, but there has been some consideration that's been given to that idea.\nWhat's notable about that is that is an application process that doesn't begin in the United States, it actually begins in Central America. And, again, that should serve as an encouragement for people who are interested and think that they may be eligible for that kind of humanitarian relief that they can apply for it in their home country. They don't have to undertake the dangerous journey to try to get to the United States. They don't have to trust a smuggler. They can apply for that status in their home country.\nGardiner.\nQ: Josh, as you know, data out today show pretty sharp increases in murder rates in the last few months in about 20 different cities. Is that a reason for concern? And do you have any more to say on Comey's interpretation of that data?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything to say beyond what I said yesterday. I will say that when Director Comey was talking about this he acknowledged that there's a lot of ambiguity about the broader trends, because in some parts of the country we haven't seen an increase in violent crime and, overall, crime across the country is at or near historic lows. The example that he raised that I think is an illustrative one is that we have seen a spike in violent crime in Dallas, but not in Houston. So the question is what accounts for that differing environment?\nAnd so we've got experts at the Department of Justice who are taking a look at these situations. What President Obama did last year was actually direct his Attorney General to ramp up the assistance that we can provide to local law enforcement that is trying to fight these violent crime spikes in some communities in the country. And that additional assistance has taken a variety of forms. It has included widespread sting operations that were carried out by U.S. marshals to round up individuals who were wanted for violent crimes. There's also additional assistance that's been provided to individual law enforcement organizations to improve training of their law enforcement officers to make them more effective.\nSo there is some assistance that the federal government can provide to law enforcement agencies that are dealing with these kinds of spikes. But it is unclear what's contributing to those spikes, because we do know that as a general matter, all across the country crime rates remain at or near historic lows.\nQ: You dismissed his notion that there is some sort of Ferguson effect and I think you talked about there's no evidence to back that up. I guess what I'm trying to understand is do you think that he is wrong, or do you think that he just doesn't have the evidence to substantiate what he said? There's sort of a difference -- either you're not sure, or you're sure he's wrong. Can you help me untangle that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the point that I was making yesterday is -- and this is based on a conversation I had with the President -- this administration makes policy decisions that are rooted in evidence, that are rooted in science. We can't make broad, sweeping policy decisions or draw policy conclusions based on anecdotal evidence. That's irresponsible and ultimately counterproductive.\nThe President actually has a lot of confidence in the vast majority of law enforcement officers all across the country to do their jobs and to do them well and to do them selflessly and to do them in a way that is effective in fighting crime and protecting civil rights at the same time. The President does not believe -- at least he has not seen evidence to substantiate the suggestion that there are a significant number of police officers out there who are unwilling to do their job because they fear being filmed by somebody's cellphone.\nBut, look, if there's evidence that materializes to substantiate that claim, then we should figure out something to do about it. So I guess the point is there isn't evidence out there to draw any firm conclusions about what's happening. The President does have a lot of confidence in the vast majority of law enforcement officers that are selflessly protecting our communities and doing it in the right way. But we should look at this problem and get to the bottom of what exactly is going on.\nAnd Director Comey did indicate that it's unclear what's going on. He acknowledged that it's a complicated situation. That's where he used the Dallas-Houston comparison to illustrate that there is no clear answer to what's going on here, and what Director Comey said is we need to spend more time trying to figure out what's happening. And he's right about that. And we should use the evidence that is uncovered to formulate an appropriate politics response. And that's what the President believes the priority should be.\nQ: Josh, I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty about everything. You guys are swimming in uncertainty. We all are. I mean, one has to act in the face of uncertainty anyway. You're suggesting, it seems to me, that you're not acting because you don't have evidence, when, in fact, in nearly every case, you have to act in the face of uncertainty anyway. Can you help me sort of, again, untangle that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would say is we do often -- the President often talks about this, about how often uncertainty impacts the decisions that he's required to make as the President of the United States. That uncertainty typically applies to situations in which there are no guarantees that what the President is prepared to choose will work.\nSo, for example, if we determine that the so-called Ferguson effect is potentially contributing to an increase in crime, then we need to sit down and figure out what can we do to address it. And there will be some uncertainty about whether or not that will work. But there won't be uncertainty about the fact that we're trying to solve the right problem, that we're trying to solve a problem that actually exists, and so collecting evidence to verify what is possible to know even if, once we get to the stage of considering solutions, there will naturally be some uncertainty about what the future holds. But even in that case, there will be some evidence to inform the choices that the President has to make.\nQ: You've got more dead bodies. I mean, that's clearly a problem. Whether --\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, I'm not denying that there is a problem as it relates to the spike in violent crime in some communities across the country. That's why the President, last year, ordered the Attorney General to provide some additional assistance to law enforcement agencies. We saw the Marshals Service carry out a widespread sweep that resulted in about 8,000 fugitives being captured. So there's plenty of evidence to indicate that there are some communities -- again, this is not a widespread phenomenon, at least based on what we know now -- but there is evidence to indicate that there are some communities, including the President's hometown of Chicago, that are experiencing a troubling surge in violent crime. And the President has ordered action, specific action to try to address it.\nBut there's not evidence at this point to link that surge in violent crime to the so-called viral video effect, or the Ferguson effect. There's just no evidence to substantiate that. And there's some anecdotal evidence to indicate that that may be having some impact, but there's plenty of anecdotal evidence that the vast majority of law enforcement officers, men and women across the country, are doing their job as well as ever; that they're fighting crime, that they're protecting people's civil rights, that they're acting selflessly and bravely to communicate -- or to protect the communities that they are sworn to serve and protect.\nSo that's the ambiguity that exists. And that's what we need to get to the bottom of before we start offering up specific solutions.\nQ: On the transgender question, can you help us untangle the President's role himself? Like did he play a direct role in the guidance? Did he meet with his Attorney General in the last week or recent weeks to discuss this? Did he meet with his Education Secretary in the last week or the week before to discuss this? Did he encourage the issue himself of this guidance? And what in particular might have persuaded him that this was the right thing to do? So can you -- a little bit more about what President Obama himself, what role he played in this?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you about the President is he was he was regularly updated as this policy process moved forward. So he was certainly aware of the policy that was under deliberation by the Department of Education. And I can tell you that the outcome does reflect his view that the Department of Education should be responsive to requests that they've received from school administrators and that the Department of Education has an obligation to put forward tangible, real-world suggestions for how this problem can be addressed in communities all across the country.\nThe President also agrees that imposing an additional requirement under the existing law is not something the Department of Education needs to be doing right now. So it's possible, and in fact, important for the U.S. Department of Education to play an appropriate role in offering this guidance to school administrators that are trying to enhance the safety and protect the dignity of every student in their community.\nQ: The suggestion is that he's sort of a bystander to this guidance coming out -- that it was part of a process, that it came out of the departments, and he didn't really do much to encourage or discourage, it just sort of happened. Is that an appropriate interpretation? Or did he play a more active role?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the President sets a longer-term vision for the priorities that his administration is going to pursue. I can't speak to all of the conversations that President Obama has had with the Education Secretary about this or other matters. But I think it is fair to say -- and I think it's important -- that this kind of announcement reflects the President's strongly held view about the need to prevent discrimination, but also the need to protect the safety and dignity of every student in America.\nSo this does reflect the President's view. But, at the same time, there's an established policy process for considering these kinds of questions and ensuring that the outcome reflects the priorities that were set by the President of the United States. In this case, they were.\nQ: In an interview with the Rutgers student newspaper, President Obama defended his administration's crackdown on leaks and press freedom by saying the prosecutions were a small sampling. But the truth is the administration has targeted more whistleblowers and prosecuted more leak investigations -- including of my colleagues -- than all previous administrations combined. Can you explain the President's remarks? Does he -- is he aware of just how many more leak investigations this administration has conducted versus all of his predecessors?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think we're going to get deep into this today. But let me say a couple of things about this. The first is, what the President said is true, that a number of those investigations were initiated by the previous administration. What is also true is questions of criminal investigations and criminal prosecutions are not influenced by the President or any other political operatives in the White House. These are decisions that are made by Department of Justice prosecutors.\nThat's the way the process should work. And it would be inappropriate for the President to intervene either way. It would be inappropriate for the President of the United States to intervene with the federal prosecutor and say, you should go investigate this individual. It would be just as inappropriate for the President to intervene and say, you should lay off that guy from The New York Times. That would be inappropriate too.\nWe've got a Department of Justice that is insulated from politics for a very good reason. And you should check with them for insight into the prosecutorial decisions that attorneys at the Department of Justice were making.\nQ: -- that these prosecutions took place during his administration? I mean, he then went on to sort of talk about how his notion himself is that there should be as much freedom as possible. As you say, these prosecutions took place during his administration, and your suggestion is that it took place essentially without any input from him or any of his direct -- in the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: And I'm suggesting it would be a genuine scandal if that were not the case.\nQ: I think that's right. So is he sorry that this number of prosecutions took place during his administration, given the fact that he can do nothing about it?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think the President does believe that people who swore an oath to protect sensitive information should follow it. And the President does believe that the Department of Justice and other agencies have a role in enforcing that oath. And that enforcement should take place without regard to political considerations. And there's just such an inquiry that's going on right now that I'm not going to comment on, but I think is an indication that this is something, at least when it comes to the handling of these kinds of matters by the Department of Justice, that should be firmly insulated from politics, and therefore, insulated from influence by the President of the United States.\nQ: Do you know of any previous state dinner that celebrated five countries at once, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. That would make tonight's event all the more special.\nAll right. Jonathan, I'll give you the last one. And then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: Okay, thank you. The President is going to Rutgers on Sunday. Why did he decide to go to Rutgers? Were any loud voices urging him to go? And can you give us an advance preview of what he's going to say there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for years, students and other leaders at Rutgers have been encouraging President Obama to consider delivering the commencement address this year because it's the 250th anniversary of the first commencement address -- the first commencement ceremonies that were hosted at Rutgers. So the President is looking forward to participating in this historic occasion. It certainly is the mark of a remarkable institution of higher learning. I know that Rutgers, in particular, is quite proud of the class of 2016, and the President is looking forward to congratulating that class on all that they have achieved.\nI think he'll have some observations about the world that they're prepared to enter. They're prepared to enter a country and a planet that's rapidly changing. And these students are as well-prepared as any students have ever been to confront those challenges and use this changing environment to create a better world. And that's what makes the President so fundamentally optimistic about the future of our country, and that optimism is manifested quite well in this year's graduating class at Rutgers.\nSo with that, why don't I do a week ahead?\nQ: Will he visit the (inaudible) at all while he's at Rutgers?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any notes about any unplanned, any unscheduled movements for the President, but we'll see if he is able to make the most of his visit to Rutgers.\nSo on Sunday -- this is not written down here, but obviously on Sunday, the President will travel to New Jersey and deliver the commencement address at the 250th commencement at Rutgers University.\nOn Monday, the President will host a Medal of Valor ceremony at the White House. The Medal of Valor is awarded to public safety officers who have exhibited exceptional courage, regardless of personal safety, in the attempt to save or protect others from harm.\nOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\nOn Wednesday, the President will participate in a DNC roundtable.\nOn Thursday, the President will award the National Medals of Science and Technology and Innovation to 17 scientists, engineers, mathematicians and innovators. The Medal of Science recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science, engineering and mathematics. The National Medal of Technology and Innovation recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America's competitiveness and quality of life and helped the nation's technological workforce.\nOn Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nAnd then on Saturday, the President will depart Washington, D.C. en route Hanoi, Vietnam. This trip will highlight the President's ongoing commitment to the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, designed to increase U.S. diplomatic, economic, and security engagement with the country and peoples of the region. So this is obviously next Saturday, a week from tomorrow, and we'll have a lot more to say about the President's trip to the Asia Pacific during next week's briefings.\nSo with all that, I hope you guys all have a great weekend. See you on Monday.\nQ: Starting now? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I resisted making that joke out of deference, but we'll pick it back up next week.\nEND 2:45 P.M.

Bernie Sanders staged big rallies here and in Fargo, North Dakota, on Friday, as he campaigned to extend a string of victories that so have garnered more than 45 percent of the delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention.\nAt both North Dakota stops, Sanders spoke about ending the corrupt campaign finance system that props up a rigged economy. He proposed taxing Wall Street speculators to help pay for tuition-free public colleges and universities. He called for strengthening Social Security to boost benefits. He advocated a Medicare-for-all health care system to provide health care for all Americans and bring down the sky-high price of prescription drugs.\nSanders and Hillary Clinton differ on those and other issues, he said, but one thing unites them in the closing weeks of a long contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. \"We may have differences of opinion but we do share one common goal and that is that Donald Trump must be defeated,\" Sanders said.\nDemocrats who want to improve their chances for success on Nov. 8 should consider who has the broadest support, he added. \"If you look at virtually every poll in the last six weeks we do better and often much better against Trump than Secretary Clinton,\" Sanders said. \"So if the goal is to defeat Donald Trump, we are the campaign to do that.\"\nAs a freight train whistled by, Sanders spoke from a platform outside the Depot Building where Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy campaigned leading up to White House bids.\nAt Sanders' rally, more than 2,200 hardy supporters clad in layers of sweatshirts and winter coats turned out on a chilly spring evening. The temperature was 49 degrees when the rally began.\n\"Our goal in the next five weeks...is to win as many delegates as we can and go into the Democratic National Convention with more delegates than Secretary Clinton,\" Sanders said. \"That will be hard,\" he allowed but added, \"We're going to fight for every remaining vote and every remaining delegate.\"\nThere are 18 pledged delegates at stake when North Dakota Democrats caucus on June 7.\n\"We have now won 19 primaries and caucuses and on June 7, if the people of North Dakota come out in large numbers, we're going to win here in North Dakota,\" Sanders said.", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Press Release - 'Trump Must be Defeated,' Sanders Tells 2,200 at Rally in North Dakota"}

This great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House. It cannot afford to put Democrats in charge of Congress. It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee, Mr. Donald J. Trump, and maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\"\n\"Any other outcome is a danger to economic growth, puts our national security in peril, enshrines ObamaCare as the law of the land, entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence, and undermines our constitutional republic.\"\n\"There is a path to winning in November, and it comes through unity. To solidify this partnership, we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him.\"\nIn response, Mr. Trump released the following statement upon news of the endorsements:\n\"It is tremendous to be working with these leaders and their colleagues on winning solutions that will really move us forward. A strong House Republican Majority is imperative to fixing the problems facing America and making our country better and stronger than ever before.\"\nMr. Trump has surged in recent polls against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, both nationally and in key battleground states such as Ohio, where he leads Clinton by a significant margin.", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Press Release - House Chairmen Endorse Donald J.

The Statement builds on a history of collaboration and reinforces commitments made on climate change and the Arctic in 2013. In the Joint Statement released today, leaders recognize that climate change is one of the foremost challenges the world is facing. In particular, the leaders reinforce that no effort should be spared in making concrete progress domestically and abroad over the coming decades by shifting to low carbon economies and creating more resilient communities. The statement reflects cooperation across a number of areas including showing leadership in the Arctic, implementing the Paris Agreement, promoting clean energy cooperation, advancing climate action globally, and promoting energy access. Today's statement is another indication of the United States' commitment to Paris and to do everything we can within our borders and beyond to take ambitious actions to address climate change.\nThe Arctic: The science of climate change in the Arctic is increasingly clear. Temperatures are rising about twice as fast as the global average; thawing permafrost destabilizes the earth on which 100,000 Alaskans live; warmer, more acidic oceans and rivers, and the migration of entire species, threatens the livelihoods of indigenous peoples; and Alaska's glaciers alone are losing about 75 gigatons of ice each year.\nWith today's Joint Statement, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have in the last two months alone committed to working towards conditioning commercial activity in the Arctic in part on world-class environmental standards and international and national climate change goals. These seven states account for about half of the Arctic waters where a state has primary rights to explore and use marine resources.\nPresident Obama and the six other leaders, including Prime Minister Trudeau and today the five Nordic leaders, have also committed to advance scientifically-based protection and conservation of ecologically important marine areas, in close consultation with subsistence communities, based on the best available science and traditional and local knowledge. In the case of the United States and Canada, we have committed to set a new long-term conservation goal later this year. Furthering these goals and more will be a key topic at the first-ever  Arctic Science Ministerial, which will be held on September 28, 2016—just after the one-year anniversary of President Obama's historic trip to Alaska. Also today, the White House is issuing a call to action for individuals, organizations, and institutions from all sectors to take new, specific, and measurable steps to help all people better understand and cope with the changing conditions in the Arctic.\nImplementing the Paris Agreement: Last month, more than 170 nations signed the Paris Agreement, including the United States, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. To reinforce their commitment, today, Iceland pledged to join the Paris agreement this year and the United States and Norway are reaffirming their commitment to join this year, alongside more than 30 countries that have already joined or have committed to do so this year. In addition, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark are committing to join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. The leaders also called on countries to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, as they implement their respective climate targets\nTo scale up support to developing countries to implement their respective Nationally Determined Contributions, the United States and the Nordic leaders are also committing to provide leadership on climate finance, including by using public resources to mobilize robust increases in private capital, and to support developing countries in strengthening their adaptation and mitigation efforts.\nThe joint collaboration announced today builds on a strong U.S. commitment to implement the Paris Agreement at home, including:\n•      Mid-Century Strategy: The United States reaffirms its commitment to, in 2016, complete a midcentury, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy.\n•      Support for Transparency: The United States reiterates its pledge of $15 million dollars to the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) that will support developing countries' efforts to meet the enhanced transparency requirements under the Paris Agreement.\n•      Support for Adaptation: The United States reaffirms its pledge to double its grant-based, public climate finance for adaptation by 2020.\nCooperation on Clean Energy: The leaders are committing to scale up the deployment of clean energy. In particular, the leaders are calling for the mobilization of private capital to finance clean energy. To reinforce that commitment, five countries announced they intend to provide funding to institutionalize the Clean Energy Ministerial, a high-level effort by 23 of the world's major economies and the European Union to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies. The United States and Denmark are also announcing a new memorandum to work together in developing offshore wind as a clean and sustainable energy source. This memorandum is a testimony to the strong Transatlantic ties between Denmark and the United States. Today's statement builds on a series of actions that the United States has taken to drive clean energy research and deployment through Mission Innovation, securing long-term extensions of the production tax credit (PTC) for wind and other renewables and the investment tax credit (ITC) for solar, and issuing eleven commercial wind leases along the Atlantic coast, which when the leases are fully developed, would generate enough energy to power over 4 million homes.\nPhasing Down HFCs: The leaders affirmed their commitment to adopt a Montreal Protocol HFC phasedown amendment in 2016 and provide additional support through the Protocol's Multilateral Fund following adoption of an amendment. Today's statement is reinforced by actions that the United States is taking to reduce the use and emissions of HFCs. The United States has been working to negotiate a Montreal Protocol HFC phasedown amendment, including putting forth a proposed amendment with Canada and Mexico. Strong international action on HFCs could avoid up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century. In terms of domestic actions, in 2014 and 2015, the White House announced a suite of private-sector commitments and other executive actions that will reduce cumulative global consumption of HFCs by the equivalent of more than 1 billion metric tons of CO2 through 2025.\nTackling Carbon Emissions from Aviation: Today, the leaders committed to work together through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to reduce international aviation's climate impact by furthering the development and deployment of sustainable alternative jet fuels, and adopting a strong market-based measure to enable carbon neutral growth from 2020 at ICAO's fall assembly. Earlier this year, the United States and 22 other countries reached  consensus on the first-ever global carbon standards for commercial aircraft. When fully implemented, the standards are expected to reduce carbon emissions more than 650 million tons between 2020 and 2040, equivalent to removing over 140 million cars from the road for a year.\nReducing Methane Emissions: In the Joint Statement, the United States and Nordic countries committed to ensure each country has developed a national methane reduction plan or otherwise identified and implemented enhanced actions to significantly reduce our overall methane emissions, and to expand technical cooperation, where appropriate.\n•      The leaders pledged to continue to drive down our oil and gas methane emissions, where applicable, through sound regulation, climate targets, and voluntary initiatives. In particular, to strongly encourage companies working within their countries to develop company-wide methane reduction goals, and to join the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Oil & Gas Methane Partnership.\n•      The Nordic countries welcome the announcement of new U.S.-Canadian methane reduction goal to reduce methane emission from the oil and gas sector 40 – 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.\n•      The Nordic countries pledged their support for the development of a global methane emission goal for the oil and gas sector.\nThe United States took two domestic actions yesterday to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. In particular, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized the first ever standards to reduce methane emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sector sources. The final New Source Performance Standards for new and modified sources are expected to reduce the equivalent of 11 million metric tons carbon dioxide and have substantial health benefits. Fulfilling one of the commitments made during the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, the United States also took the first step on the path to regulating existing oil and gas operations by issuing for public comment the first draft of an Information Collection Request (ICR) that, once finalized, will require companies operating existing oil and gas sources to provide information to access different regulatory approaches to reduce emissions from these sources.\nCollaboration on the Important Role of Forests: The United States and the Nordic countries are determined to cooperate on the important role of forests in addressing climate change by supporting and incentivizing developing country forest partners to conserve, restore and sustainably manage forests, as well as strengthen their respective efforts to combat illegal logging and associated trade. The leaders also committed to facilitate private sector efforts to eliminate deforestation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, cattle and soy. To reinforce these commitments:\n•      The United States and Norway are announcing that they will sign a joint statement to reinforce their intention to enhance cooperation on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and sustainable landscapes.\n•      Yesterday, the United States announced the first results of a detailed action plan to reduce emissions and increase carbon storage in soils and forests through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Building Blocks for Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry. Through this initiative, USDA committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon stored in forests and soils by over 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2025 and announced yesterday that they are providing more than $70 million in funding for conservation practices that advance this commitment, including for forestry management.\nPromoting Energy for All:The Nordic countries and the United States commit to further strengthen efforts to achieve global access to sustainable, reliable, affordable and modern energy for all, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, more than two-thirds of the population is without access to power. To support a doubling of electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa the United States and Nordic countries have expressed our support for the Power Africa initiative and commit to work together to provide technical assistance, financing, and other support to enable additional investment in energy projects throughout the region. In 2014, Sweden became the first bilateral partner to join Power Africa, committing to catalyze investments of $1 billion dollars in support of our shared goals under Power Africa. In 2015, Power Africa announced a new partnership with Norway, through which Norway is committing to bringing 1,500 megawatts (MW) online over a five-year period, contributing to Power Africa's 30,000 MW electricity generation goal by 2030.", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Fact Sheet on U.S.-Nordic Collaboration on Climate Change, the Arctic, and Clean Energy"}

In his remarks, he referred to Swedish musician Tim Bergling, known as \"Avicii.\" Prime Minister Solberg referred to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117483", "text": "President Obama. Good morning, everybody. Due to the possibility of thunderstorms, we decided to move our arrival ceremony indoors. Of course, our Nordic friends are used to tough weather. You should know that here in Washington we have not seen the sun for about 3 weeks, which you experience for months on end. But despite that fact, we want you to know that we are deeply happy to have all of you here.\nWe're honored to welcome not one nation, but five, our great Nordic friends and partners: President Niinistö and Mrs. Haukio of Finland; Prime Minister Solberg and Mr. Finnes of Norway; Prime Minister and Mrs. Löfven of Sweden; Prime Minister and Mrs. Rasmussen of Denmark; and Prime Minister Jóhannsson and Mrs. Ingjaldsdóttir of Iceland.\nTo you and your delegations, welcome to the United States. I'm going to try this as best as I can. Tervetuloa.\nPresident Niinistö. Excellent. [Laugher]\nPresident Obama. Velkommen. Välkommen. [Laughter] And Velkomin. [Laugher] Those I'm not sure were delivered perfectly, but I think the spirit was understood.\nToday is an opportunity for Michelle and me to return some of the warmth and hospitality that we've received on our visits to Copenhagen and Oslo and during my visit to Stockholm. And to Americans who cannot visit themselves, don't worry, I understand that Sweden has a phone number where you can call a Swede and learn about all things Swedish. Iceland invites you to send your questions to #AskGudmunder—[laughter]—I gather that Iceland has a lot of folks named Gudmunder—and they'll answer.\nBut they are extraordinary countries. And most importantly, for our purposes here today, they are extraordinarily friendly—extraordinary friends. This is also a special day for the millions of Americans who proudly trace their ancestry to Nordic countries, particularly in the Midwest, including my home State of Illinois. They'll remind you that Leif Erikson reached this continent more than a thousand years ago. They honor their parents and grandparents who crossed oceans and carved out new lives and helped build our country. They wear their wooly sweaters; they display Dala horses and love lutefisk and lefse. [Laughter] This is the history and the heritage and the ties of family and friendship that bring us together here today.\nAround the world, America's closest partners are democracies. And we only need to look at our Nordic friends to see why. We share the same interests and we share the same values. We believe that our citizens have the right to live in freedom and security: free from terrorism and in a Europe where smaller nations are not bullied by larger nations. We believe in free markets and trade that support jobs and strong protections for workers and the environment and a strong safety net that provides a basic measure of security in life. We believe that we have a moral obligation—to this and future generations—to confront the reality of climate change and to protect our planet, including our beautiful Arctic. We believe in societies that create opportunity for all people, through education, health care, and equal opportunity—including for women. In fact, in a world of growing economic disparities, Nordic countries have some of the least income inequality in the world, which may explain one of the reasons that they're some of the happiest people in the world, despite not getting much sun. [Laughter]\nAnd we believe in the inherent dignity of every human being. We believe in pluralism and tolerance and respect for free speech and freedom of religion. It's why we welcome the refugee who seeks a better life. It's why we stand up for human rights around the world. It's why our nations are leading contributors of humanitarian and development aid: to spare a child, even on the other side of the world, a preventable disease; to give girls, even on the other side of the world, the chance at an education; and to end the outrage of extreme poverty.\nIn their own region and with the world, the Nordic countries are a model of cooperation, and they consistently punch above their weight in meeting the challenges of our time. Our Nordic partners are not large countries, but there are almost no issues that we deal with—whether in terms of security or economics or humanitarian assistance—where the Nordic countries are not some of our most reliable and effective and important partners. And that's why I wanted to invite them here today, because sometimes, we have a tendency to take our best friends for granted, and it's important that we not do so. They have been extraordinarily important for us in shaping and maintaining an international order that is rule based, that is fair, that is just.\nSo I really do believe that the world would be more secure and more prosperous if we just had more partners like our Nordic countries. [Laughter] There have been times where I've said, why don't we just put all these small countries in charge for a while? [Laughter] And they could clean things up. [Laughter]\nNow, I will admit that, to our American ears, Nordic languages and expressions can sometimes be a little confusing. We have a television program here called \"Game of Thrones\"—that's what it sounds like sometimes. [Laughter]\nBut the truth is, they—we are grateful to everything that our Nordic friends have contributed to us, not just in terms of partnerships and politics, but also our culture. We read our children Hans Christian Andersen and Pippi Longstocking. Our children's imaginations come to life with Legos. Our homes and lives are infused with Scandinavian furniture and design. Some of us dance and sing to ABBA and Avicii. [Laughter] I do want to point out that Finland has perhaps the most heavy metal bands in the world—[laughter]—per capita and also ranks high on good governance. I don't know that there's any correlation there. [Laughter] Thanks to Nordic innovators, we share our music on Spotify, stay in touch by Skype, and millions spend what would otherwise be productive hours on Minecraft, Angry Birds, and Candy Crush. [Laughter]\nThe poet Henrik Ibsen once wrote that \"a community is like a ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.\" As democratic societies, we believe that our ship is stronger when everyone has the opportunity to succeed. As free nations, we believe our world is safer when all of us contribute to security and peace. So, to my fellow leaders, this is the work I look forward to advancing with you here today. And in that spirit, I welcome you all, once again, to the United States of America.\nNow, given the unique nature of this visit, we have an unusual arrangement to our program. Throughout the day, we are going to hear from all five Nordic leaders, but we're not going to have them speak consecutively in each occasion. Otherwise, we'd be here all day. [Laughter] So because the Nordic countries are famous for their cooperation, there has been an allocation of time, and we're going to begin this morning with President Niinistö of Finland and Prime Minister Solberg of Norway. So they will provide us some brief remarks, and you will hear from the other leaders later in the—today.\nMr. Prime Minister.\nPresident Niinistö. Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, we, the leaders of the five Nordic countries and our spouses are grateful to you for inviting us and convening this second U.S.-Nordic summit. Thank you for the wonderful welcome.\nAlready, upon arrival, the flags on Pennsylvania Avenue gave a heartening feeling to us. Dear President, I have to apologize that we forgot to take the sun with us. [Laughter] We have had a lot of sunshine this spring. [Laughter]\nThe Nordics are a family with a profound commonality of values and history and with strong ties of cooperation. With you, Mr. President, we feel we have a kindred spirit. Gender equality, equal opportunities, and human rights for all, democracy, the rule of law, and respect of international law—these are hallmarks of our societies and an agenda that we share. Together, the Nordics are a superpower; not militarily, but when it comes to innovation, education, competitiveness, sustainable development, and clean technologies. See, together, we are the world's 12th largest economy. Free trade is clearly in our interest. We also claim superpower status as far as culture and sports are concerned. And as you see, we are champions in modesty too. [Laughter]\nMr. President, we are grateful for the leadership that the United States has shown in combating the most existential threat in the world—that is climate change—and focusing attention to the Arctic, where we are practically neighbors. The Arctic Council can be used also as an instrument of confidence building. The Nordic countries give high value to multilateral cooperation, which you have stressed during your tenure. This is vitally important.\nTimes are turbulent in many respects. Security threats abound. The situation has become more tense, even in the Baltic Sea region and northern Europe, our neck of the woods. Strengthening security and stability there is called for, and this includes appropriate dialogue with Russia to enhance transparency and reduce risks.\nThe Nordic countries are, in many ways, security providers in our own region and Europe, but also globally. We shoulder our responsibilities. We seek solutions instead of problems. We are willing and able to continue to cooperate with you in promoting security and stability. We value highly the U.S. commitment to Europe and to our security.\nFinland is proud of the longstanding and firm friendship with the U.S. It is based on common values and interests, proud contacts between our people, and vibrant interaction, economically and socially. We are committed to strengthening this partnership even further.\nToday I am honored to say to you on behalf of the Nordic countries: In us, Nordic countries, Mr. President, the United States has a solid friend and a strong partner. We are willing to work together with the United States to build a better future for the whole mankind. Thank you.\nPrime Minister Solberg. President, First Lady, Nordic colleagues, distinguished guests, and dear friends: Thank you very much for the very warm welcome you've given both to my husband and me and the other members of our delegation. As you make the most of your final year in the White House, we are delighted to note, Mr. President, you have clearly saved the best for last. [Laughter]\nA few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of welcoming some special American guests to Norway. It was our annual NATO exercise, Cold Response. The exercise provided valuable joint training in winter warfare. But I'll be honest, and I'll confess that one of the highlights for the Norwegians is watching U.S. marines learning how to ski—cross-country ski. [Laughter]\nMr. President, you stand shoulder to shoulder with us in the deep snows of Norway, just as our navy proudly patrolled waters of Hawaii, your birth State, 2 years ago during the RIMPAC exercise; just as we stood together after 9/11, and just as we now have joined forces in the fight against ISIL. This is the nature of our alliance and our partnership. We are bound by the experiences and the history that we share.\nOne of the Marines I met in the NATO exercise in Norway was called Cage—Cage Solberg. [Laughter] As his name illustrates, there are millions of people of Norwegian descent in the United States. In fact, there are more here than there are in Norway. [Laughter] Thousands of Norwegians crossed the huge, expansive Atlantic Ocean in the mid-19th century to pursue the new opportunities for themselves and their children. They carried the dream of a better life in the United States.\nToday, the Atlantic Ocean unites us more than it separates us. It has made Norway a seafaring nation, open to trade with the world and committed to developing our fish, gas, and oil resources in a sustainable matter. The Norwegian coastline reaches to the North Cape. Keeping close eyes on the development in the high north is a key priority for us. Preserving stability and predictability in our own region benefits the entire NATO alliance.\nAnd as close allies, we share common values. And that is, of course, no coincidence. In 1814, our Founding Fathers looked to America for inspiration in drafting the Norwegian Constitution. Our common values remain steadfast: freedom, democracy, equality, and human rights. Our values reflect the nature of our friendship and the partnership that we hold dear.\nToday's U.S.-Nordic summit is a strong reminder of what we have achieved together. But we know there's more to be done. The United States is a great power, and the five Nordic countries have different roles to play in the international arena, but we can achieve great things when we pursue the same goals.\nMr. President, I would like to commend you on your leadership. Your commitment to achieving real progress in climate change was essential for the Paris Agreement. American leadership is key to ensuring the future of the planet. We share your dedication to disarmament and nuclear security. Nonproliferation, disarmament, and arms controls are key elements of international security. And we will support your request for bold new reductions on a reciprocal basis to make the world safer.\nMr. President, in New York last year, the international community established a roadmap for the future by agreeing on the sustainable development goals. If we make the right choices, over the next 15 years, we can eradicate extreme poverty, and we can have a fair and more peaceful future. And we can do all this in a way that safeguards the planet. Broad partnerships and innovative new approaches will be needed to achieve these goals. The United States and the Nordics will be in front. And we know of few ventures that will provide a better return than girls' education. I greatly appreciate the leadership of the First Lady, who has provided in this cause. It's a cause we share as women and as mothers and as leaders. Today's summit is an important opportunity to advance the U.S.-Nordic cooperation and to reiterate the values that we share and the truths that we hold for being self-evident. Because we are stronger and more effective together, let us ensure that the bonds between us and our countries remain as powerful as they are today. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Thank you, everybody. We're going to go get to work. We're very grateful for the presence of our leaders here.", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for President Sauli Niinistö of Finland, Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen of Denmark, and Prime Minister Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson of Iceland"}

Well, once again, I want to welcome our Nordic partners. The last time that we met together was 3 years ago in Sweden, and we had a very productive meeting again here today.\nAs I said this morning, the United States is grateful for the partnership that we have with all the countries represented around this table. They are, individually, not large countries in terms of population, but in terms of effectiveness, contributions, ideas, energy, they are enormously important players on the international stage. And the fact that our values and our interests align make them one of our most important partners. So we very much want to thank their presence.\nGiven the threats of terrorism, our Nordic partners are making significant contributions in the fight against ISIL, including more special operations forces and aircrafts and trainers, more assistance to stabilize areas that have been liberated from ISIL and more humanitarian assistance to Syrians and Iraqis.\nWe discussed our counterterrorism cooperation, and that includes the need to share more information. And I want to thank Denmark for new commitments to the NATO mission in Afghanistan.\nBeyond our military campaign, we agreed that we need to work together in support of a political settlement to end the Syrian civil war. And our countries will continue to work together to counter violent extremism and to prevent people from being radicalized in the first place.\nI want to commend the contributions that these countries have made in absorbing refugees. And we had a significant discussion around the issue of migrants and refugees. I think it's useful for the American press to understand that, although some of the absolute numbers that are going into these respective countries may not seem that large, when you look at it on a per-capita basis, they are making an enormously generous effort to help people in great need. But it's important for the world to carry this burden alongside them and not allow any individual country to carry those burdens alone, which is part of the reason why I'm glad we'll get strong cooperation and participation in the summit on refugees that I intend to host in September in the margins of the U.N. General Assembly.\nWith regard to European security, as we head into the NATO summit in Warsaw, I'm pleased that Denmark and Norway will be joining the United States in contributing to an enhanced, allied, forward presence to bolster our collective defense in Europe. And all of our nations agreed to increase cooperation between NATO and the EU.\nWe agreed on the need to continue to support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia until we can get a resolution, as was outlined in the Minsk agreements, and that those need to be fully implemented. We're united in our concern about Russia's growing aggressive military presence and posture in the Baltic-Nordic region. We will be maintaining ongoing dialogue and seek cooperation with Russia, but we also want to make sure that we are prepared and strong, and we want to encourage Russia to keep its military activities in full compliance with international obligations.\nAs members of the EU, Denmark, Finland, Sweden are strong supporters of T-TIP. I reaffirmed my intention to try to get this done before the end of the year. And we discussed the importance of Europe's energy security, including diversification of suppliers and sources and routes.\nOur six nations remain strong partners in climate change, including the implementation of the Paris Agreement and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. And as Arctic nations, we committed to conservation and sustainable development that prioritize our efforts to combat climate change. And we look forward to hosting the first-ever White House Arctic Science Ministerial this fall to ensure that we're working together on that issue.\nAnd finally, all the leaders here are key partners in global development. The Nordic countries are some of the few countries—and by the way, the United States doesn't fall into this category of meeting the goals that had been set with respect to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance. And I'd like us to do even more. They're doing a great job. And the coordination in terms of global health security, in terms of encouraging women's education and inclusion in economies, developing sustainable development in poor countries, and eradicating extreme poverty, as was outlined in the 2030 agenda—all these countries have been outstanding leaders in this process. And one of the things we discussed is how we can coordinate better so that we get more effect from the common contributions that we're making in that regard.\nSo I thought this was a very useful and important conversation—although there was probably too much agreement—[laughter]—to make for as exciting a multilateral meeting as I sometimes participate in.\nWith that, what I'd like to do is to turn it over to Prime Minister Löfven, who is going to be sharing, I think, for the group their perspective on how the meeting went.\nStefan.\nPrime Minister Löfven. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you once again for inviting us Nordic leaders to this summit. We appreciate it very much.\nWe know that the United States and the Nordic countries, we share a great history. More than 11 million Americans have Scandinavian heritage. So we share that, but we also share many values. And that was clear today. Let me just give two examples.\nFirst, we agree on the need of global response to common challenges. And the transatlantic link is more important than ever. It is actually key to preserving European and global security. And in times when basic rules and norms of international standards are contested, we stand side by side to defend them. We will not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea or accept Russian aggression in Ukraine. We are convinced that a negotiated two-state solution in—is urgently needed for peace and security for both Israel and Palestine and will require actions and responsibility.\nWe welcome the military progress made by the coalition against Daesh, while seeking to complement these efforts with strong political and civilian support. We have also agreed to work together to tackle the root causes of forced migration. I believe that we need a globally shared responsibility in handling the flows of migration, and we welcome the U.S.-led leaders' summit on refugees in September, to which Sweden will seek to actively contribute. And I will personally attend that summit. I think it's very, very important to have a global perspective on the migration issue.\nThe same goes for climate change. And I applaud President Obama's instrumental role in pushing for the climate agenda and a clean energy revolution in U.S. and globally. And our Nordic countries will gladly both cooperate and compete in the race to reduce emission. And I can also say that Sweden aims to be the first fossil-free welfare nation in the world.\nSecondly, the U.S. and the Nordic countries share the belief that the best foundation for individual freedom are jobs, growth, and social investments. To create jobs, we need free trade, sustainable investment that embraces innovation and new technology. That is why I'm a staunch supporter of bringing the U.S. and EU closer together through a strong Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.\nBut with freedom comes also responsibility. We strive for trade that is both free and fair, enables social development, creates better working conditions, and protects our environment. We share the belief that women's empowerment and participation in the workforce are necessary to achieve real, sustainable development. Gender equality is both financially smart and a fundamental matter of human rights.\nOur five countries have developed what has been known as the Nordic welfare model to enable more people to work, to increase gender equality, and to create socially inclusive societies. And we are proud to see that those ideas are also discussed and developed here in the United States, with President Obama's strong efforts for affordable health care, socially—social safety nets, and higher education system for all.\nI believe that seeing U.S. advance on these issues will create new ripples of hope for all of us who believe in social justice and individual freedom. And as we have read in the Atlantic, President Obama likes to say, if only everyone could be like the Scandinavians, this would all be easy. [Laughter] We don't know about that. But let me just add that we Scandinavians truly enjoy cooperation with the United States to make life not only easier, but better and freer for all.\nThank you very much.\nPresident Obama. Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland, Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen of Denmark, and Prime Minister Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson of Iceland"}

Transparency, accountability and good governance, strong market economies, free trade, shared prosperity, open space for civil society, and sustainable development are keys to political stability and social well-being. We reaffirm our commitment to pursue these values and objectives and to work together to encourage other countries to do the same.\nBuilding on the U.S.-Nordic meeting in 2013 in Stockholm, today we have pledged to deepen our cooperation on key international issues related to security and defense; migration and refugees; climate, energy and the Arctic; and economic growth and global development.\nSecurity and Defense\nThe Nordic countries and the United States stress the importance of upholding the European security order and the fundamental principles of international law. Our countries are committed to strengthening investments in defense and military capabilities, as well as in diplomacy and regional cooperation, commensurate with a more challenging security environment. The Nordic countries greatly value the United States' commitment to Europe and its security. NATO remains key to transatlantic and European security, and the contributions of Sweden and Finland, including those they make as NATO enhanced opportunity partners, are highly valuable. The United States, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway are committed to building on NATO's enhanced opportunity partners' framework in order to promote a close political dialogue and military cooperation between Finland and Sweden and NATO Allies (28+2). Through their overlapping memberships in NATO and the EU, the Nordic states, and the United States take measures to increase regional security that are mutually reinforcing and contribute substantially to stability in Europe. The Nordic countries and the United States strongly support closer cooperation between NATO and the EU, and consider new areas of practical cooperation between the two to be a priority for the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July.\nWe share with the Baltic States an interest in strengthening the security and stability of the Baltic Sea region. The United States welcomes Nordic Defense Cooperation and intends to support its initiatives, including participation in training, exercises, and creative frameworks that deepen regional ties and promote security. We commit to improving our individual and collective capacity to withstand hybrid threats and to leverage appropriate political, economic, and military tools to strengthen national and regional resilience. In anticipation of the NATO Summit in Warsaw, Denmark and Norway are prepared to join the United States in contributing to enhanced allied forward presence. Concrete contributions will be developed in consultations with NATO allies in preparation for the NATO Summit. The United States and the Nordic countries share a firm conviction that there can be no compromises over the international security order and its fundamental principles. Russia's illegal occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea, which we do not accept, its aggression in Donbas, and its attempts to destabilize Ukraine are inconsistent with international law and violate the established European security order. The United States and the Nordic countries reaffirm our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Europe and the United States have reacted firmly to Russia's violations of international law in Ukraine. Sanctions against Russia for its actions in eastern Ukraine cannot be lifted until Russia fully implements its Minsk commitments. Our Crimea-related sanctions are also to remain in force until Russia returns this territory to Ukrainian control.\nWe expect the Ukrainian government to redouble efforts to adopt and implement effective reforms. The United States and the Nordic countries will continue to assist Ukraine actively in this effort. We strongly support the EU's Eastern Partnership.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are concerned by Russia's growing military presence in the Baltic Sea region, its nuclear posturing, its undeclared exercises, and the provocative actions taken by Russian aircraft and naval vessels. We call on Russia to ensure that its military maneuvers and exercises are in full compliance with its international obligations and commitments to security and stability. Our countries recognize the need for an appropriate dialogue with Russia to be maintained to enhance transparency and reduce risk, and to address issues of common concern, including the counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict in Syria.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are committed to partnering together to strengthen international security and address global issues beyond Europe. Global stability requires determined steps to address the problems faced by fragile states and to address the root causes of conflict and instability. We together recognize Sweden's leadership on the International Dialogue for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding and acknowledge that the world's poorest and most vulnerable are increasingly concentrated in fragile states. We reaffirm our shared commitment to work together to promote resilient, democratic societies and to address the drivers of state fragility. We share a long-term commitment to stabilization and development in Afghanistan and are working to bolster the Afghan government and its security forces, maintain international support for Afghanistan, and encourage the Taliban to join a meaningful and inclusive peace process with the Afghan government. Denmark will further strengthen its contribution to NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan to around 100 military personnel and has also decided to sustain its financial support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces with $15 million annually until 2020, setting a strong example for the international community heading into the NATO Summit in Warsaw. Achieving a negotiated settlement to the war in Syria is an immediate and pressing issue. The United States and the Nordic countries have a common aim in stabilizing the situation in Mali and the Sahel region as well as in Somalia and the Horn of Africa. The long-term stability of the Middle East requires that key players assume their responsibilities to make progress on Middle East peace. The situation on the ground shows the urgent need for a negotiated two-state solution, which remains the only way to achieve a sustainable, long-term peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Norway, as chair of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, will continue its efforts to support a sustainable Palestinian economy as a critical component of a political solution.\nTerrorism and violent extremism are major challenges for the international community. The United States and the Nordic countries intend to work together to counter these threats as well as to address their root causes. As members of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, our collective aim is to degrade the capabilities of and to defeat Da'esh. We confirm our continued engagement in all lines of effort in the Coalition's fight against Da'esh in Iraq and Syria and in advancing stabilization, civilian support, and humanitarian aid in the region.\nDenmark will redeploy F16 fighter jets, a C130J transport aircraft, and make additional troop contributions, including special operation forces, for operations in Iraq and Syria. Denmark will also support stabilization efforts in Iraq and Syria with at least $40 million over the next three years, and has pledged $47 million in 2016 for humanitarian relief in Syria. Finland is enhancing its contribution to Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq by providing up to 100 training staff in the fall of 2016. Finland is committing $29 million for humanitarian relief in Syria in 2016. From the beginning of the crisis, Finnish humanitarian assistance has amounted to more than $120 million. Norway has stepped up its military contribution to the coalition against ISIL, and will continue to train Iraqi soldiers and will deploy a contingent of around 60 soldiers that will provide training, advice and operational support to Syrian local forces fighting ISIL. Norway has recently pledged $1.2 billion over 4 years in humanitarian aid to Syria and has pledged $24 million to stabilization efforts, including $3.1 million in 2016 for demining in Iraq. Sweden is contributing military trainers in Iraq, has provided over $400 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq and Syria since 2011, and has committed $200 million in development assistance to address the Syrian crisis over 5 years. The US is leading the global coalition to counter ISIL and is the largest contributor of stabilization and humanitarian assistance to Iraq and Syria, most recently announcing an additional $155 million in humanitarian relief for Iraq and contributing over $600 million for Syria, as announced at the recent London Conference.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries will continue to work together, exchange information, and share experiences on preventing and countering violent extremism. Nordic and U.S. local officials and civil society leaders plan to exchange best practices for local CVE programming. We encourage Nordic and U.S. cities to join the Strong Cities Network in order to share their experiences and reach out to other cities around the world. We also encourage youth to join the Youth Civil Activism Network to find innovative ways to counter violent extremism.\nCivilian support and stabilization in post-conflict countries must address the humanitarian hazards posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). Building on the U.S.-Norwegian Demining Initiative for Colombia, The United States and Nordic countries commit to establishing a new U.S.-Nordic partnership to support the removal of such weapons, making post-conflict communities safer and setting the stage for recovery and development. The United States and Nordic countries encourage other countries as well as private sector participants to join this new partnership. Nordic countries commit to provide more than $13 million toward UXO removal in Syria and Iraq, with a focus on efforts in Ramadi and other areas liberated from ISIL.\nCyberspace issues, including cybersecurity, the application of international law and norms in cyberspace, and Internet governance pose pressing and continuously evolving challenges. We acknowledge that cyber threats undermine our collective ability to use the Internet to bolster economic growth and development around the world. In cyberspace, just as elsewhere, states have a special responsibility to promote security, stability, and economic ties with other nations. In support of that objective, we affirm that no state should conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors. We also endorse the 2015 report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, affirm that existing international law, in particular the UN Charter, applies to state conduct in cyberspace, and commit ourselves to the view that all states should abide by voluntary and non-binding norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace during peacetime.\nMajor progress has been made in promoting crisis management—both military and civilian—as highlighted by the Leaders' Summit on UN peacekeeping in September 2015. The United States and the Nordic countries intend to continue to engage in making UN peace operations more effective, efficient and responsive, based on the recommendations of the High-Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations. Preventive action and peacebuilding are essential.\nWomen's full and meaningful participation in all aspects of social and political life is key to sustainable peace, security and development. The Nordic countries and the United States believe that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls are important goals in their own right, as well as powerful instruments for building human capacity and promoting social and political stability. The United States and the Nordic countries will continue empowering women and highlighting the importance of women's active participation in conflict prevention and resolution, peace processes, mediation, peacemaking, peacekeeping, humanitarian response, and post-conflict reconstruction as set forth in UNSCR 1325 and its progeny. Both the Nordic Women Mediators' Network and the Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations are valuable contributions. We reaffirm the importance of making all efforts to prevent gender-based and sexual violence, to support victims, and to hold perpetrators to account in order to redress the culture of impunity that often surrounds such acts of violence. The United States and the Nordic countries encourage partners to join the initiative Call to Action on Protection from gender-based Violence in Emergencies, for which Sweden recently took over the chairmanship from the United States. We are committed to strengthening the UN Peace and Security Agenda.\nArms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation are major areas for cooperation for the United States and Nordic countries. Our countries are committed to working together in promoting nuclear security, disarmament and non-proliferation. Building on the achievements of the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, the United States and the Nordic countries intend to work together within the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, INTERPOL, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Global Partnership to promote improvements in nuclear security and to counter nuclear smuggling. We are committed to full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors. The United States and Nordic countries intend to continue to show leadership toward minimizing the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian applications. The destruction of Syria's declared chemical weapons was an important achievement in which cooperation between the United States, Denmark, Finland, and Norway played a prominent role, and we continue to press Syria with respect to omissions and discrepancies in its declaration. We share a common view on the importance of implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. Norway contributed to the removal of Iran's low-enriched uranium in December 2015. The Nordic countries and the United States support the objectives set out in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and commit to assist a number of developing countries to meet their obligations under international health regulations, including by developing and assisting with implementation of a national plan to achieve the targets of the GHSA. In this regard, the United States will assist at least 31 countries, and Nordic Countries will collectively assist 10 countries. The United States and Nordic Countries will also support Joint External Evaluations, developed under the leadership of the United States and Finland, including by providing technical and/or financial assistance.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries reaffirm our support for the UN and for mediation, conflict prevention and peacebuilding, as well as for the development of peacebuilding and peacekeeping operations. The U.S.-Nordic Security Dialogue continues to be an important forum for deliberations on these issues.\nMigration and Refugees\nToday the number of irregular migrants, refugees, and internally displaced people is on a scale unprecedented since World War II. This is a global challenge requiring a comprehensive and systematic response. The United States and the Nordic countries commit to work together to meet urgent humanitarian needs and promote solutions that deal with the root causes of irregular migration, address associated challenges such as human smuggling and trafficking, and seek global solutions that promote respect for the right to seek and attain asylum, taking into account regional responsibility-sharing arrangements.\nLegal pathways to immigration and orderly refugee resettlement are a superior alternative to irregular migratory movements, and also reduce risks of discrimination and abuse to members of more vulnerable groups such as older persons, persons with disabilities, women, and children.\nNordic countries and the United States are world leaders in humanitarian response and have historically taken in a large share of refugees. We intend to maintain our humanitarian record and to advance measures to make the international humanitarian response more effective, efficient and fully able to respond to today's challenges. Further, the United States is committed to working alongside Europe in dealing with the global refugee and migration crisis and by addressing its root causes. Support to the regions hardest affected by the refugee crisis is one of the most effective components of a sustainable solution.\nThere is a clear link between forced displacements and the lack of good governance, rule of law and respect for human rights. We emphasize the responsibility of states to protect their populations from genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes.\nThere is a fundamental need to strengthen humanitarian response, to fashion a long-term approach to managing migration and recurring and protracted crises and to identify global solutions based on responsibility sharing and respect for international human rights. The World Humanitarian Summit in May, the UN High-Level Meeting on Addressing Large Scale Movements of Refugees and Migrants, and the U.S.-led Leaders' Summit on Refugees in September are excellent opportunities for addressing humanitarian challenges and irregular migration, and advancing concrete and comprehensive solutions for vulnerable refugee populations.\nClimate Change, Energy and the Arctic The leaders recognize that climate change is one of the foremost challenges the world is facing. No effort should be spared in making concrete progress domestically and abroad over the coming decades by shifting to low carbon economies and creating more resilient communities. The United States and the Nordic countries acknowledge the foundational role energy plays in our economies and that energy security is key for overall security.\nBuilding on a history of collaboration, the United States and the Nordic countries commit to strengthening European energy security and to join and implement the Paris Agreement, accelerate the transition to a clean energy future, strengthen adaptation efforts, especially in developing countries, protect and restore forests, and continue to take science-based steps to protect the Arctic and its peoples.\nEnergy Security\nThe United States and the Nordic countries agree that a well-functioning, integrated and efficient European energy market is important to producing economic prosperity and energy security. Diversified supply sources and routes are a prerequisite for an efficient energy market and the security of Europe's energy supply. We support the EU goal of increased diversification of supply sources and routes, increased indigenous and sustainable production, greater levels of interconnection, and enhanced energy efficiency. We also support the efforts of EU countries to further improve the functioning of the market, including by establishing more infrastructure to enhance the efficiency of the market and by developing a more effective regulatory framework to promote energy security and support diversification of fuel types, sources, and routes for energy imports. These steps are preconditions for energy security, affordable energy and an effective climate policy in Europe.\nImplementing the Paris Agreement\nThe leaders commit to join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. Norway, Iceland, and the United States have committed to join the Paris Agreement this year, building on more than 30 countries that have already joined or have committed to taking necessary domestic steps with a view to joining this year. As countries implement their respective Nationally Determined Contributions, they should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies pursuant to the Paris Agreement.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are committed to working with developing country partners to assist in strengthening their adaptation and mitigation efforts. We intend to make every effort to enhance the effectiveness of adaptation assistance by coordinating support for adaptation planning and action in appropriate fora, including the National Adaptation Plans Global Network. The United States and the Nordic countries recognize the potential for the effects of climate change to exacerbate conflict and fragility in vulnerable countries and share the view that foreign policy instruments must contribute to addressing this challenge effectively. We commit to prioritizing the prevention of compound risks stemming from climate fragility and to better integrating consideration of those risks into foreign, defense, and development policies, planning, and assistance programs.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries commit to provide leadership on climate finance. Following the Paris Agreement, it is critical to scale up support to developing countries to implement their respective Nationally Determined Contributions, including by using public resources to mobilize robust increases in private capital.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries will also work together to inform robust accounting for the use of international carbon markets, including a new offset program under the UNFCCC, to ensure the environmental integrity and to avoid the double counting of market-based mitigation actions.\nCooperation on Clean Energy\nThe world is facing a dual challenge: we need to meet the increased energy demand following a growing population and economic growth and at the same time, we need to reduce the emissions. A comprehensive change in the global energy system is required in order to reduce emissions. The United States and the Nordic countries will be at the forefront of efforts to develop cleaner energy systems, renewable energy, including renewable fuels, increased energy efficiency and technologies for cleaner energy production.\nThe leaders also intend to cooperate and use their influence in multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to decrease their carbon footprint by promoting an increase in their investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. We will also advocate for public-private partnerships and the mobilization of private capital to finance climate investments and the transition to clean energy, including clean energy systems and other instruments mentioned in the Nordic declaration on innovative climate finance.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are committed to promoting the aims of the Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation and to implement ambitious energy transitions to accelerate the deployment of clean energy sources. In particular, we intend to provide resources, and political support to establish a multilateral secretariat, including a financial contribution of $1.3 million from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and $1 million from the United States, along with continued, extensive support for Clean Energy Ministerial initiatives and campaigns.\nGiven the growing importance of offshore wind to their clean energy future, the United States and several Nordic countries commit to collaborate to increase the deployment of offshore wind in the United States and Europe. To formalize their collaboration, the Government of Denmark and the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are announcing a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) to strengthen cooperation on offshore wind energy. The MOU highlights important priorities for cooperation and information sharing between the countries related to best practices for managing offshore wind, effective regulatory approaches, protection of the environment, and strategies to encourage expansion of offshore wind energy development. The MOU builds on ongoing U.S. engagement with Denmark on offshore wind.\nEnhancing Climate Action through International Fora\nThe United States and the Nordic countries intend to support enhanced climate action by working together to achieve ambitious outcomes within international fora such as the Montreal Protocol and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In particular, the United States and Nordic countries affirm their commitment to adopt a Montreal Protocol HFC phasedown amendment in 2016, and intend to provide additional support through the Protocol's Multilateral Fund following adoption of an amendment for its implementation. The United States and Nordic countries plan to continue to support a range of activities that promote alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high global warming potential and to promote greener technologies in all countries.\nThe leaders also express their strong commitment to work together and through the ICAO to reduce international aviation's climate impact by fostering technological and operational advancements, development and deployment of sustainable alternative jet fuels, and adopting a strong global market-based measure (GMBM) to enable carbon neutral growth from 2020. They encourage world leaders to join them in supporting adoption at ICAO's fall 2016 Assembly of a GMBM that reflects environmental integrity and avoids market distortion.\nThe United States and Iceland reaffirm their support for the Global Geothermal Alliance launched during COP21 in Paris—a concerted effort by governments, international agencies and the private sector to promote wider penetration of geothermal in the global energy mix.\nCombatting Methane Emissions\nThe leaders reconfirm our commitment to combat methane emissions as part of our commitment to implement the Paris Agreement, and in line with other international commitments and national priorities, by ensuring each country has developed a national methane reduction plan or otherwise identified and implemented enhanced actions to significantly reduce our overall methane emissions, and by expanding technical cooperation, where appropriate. We are determined to continue to drive down our oil and gas methane emissions, where applicable, through sound regulation, climate targets, and voluntary initiatives. In particular, we strongly encourage companies working within our countries to develop company-wide methane reduction goals, and to join the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Oil & Gas Methane Partnership. The Nordic countries welcome the announcement of new U.S.-Canadian methane reduction goals from the oil and gas sector, and pledge to keep their respective methane emissions from this sector at or below current levels. The Nordic countries will also encourage other countries to join in this effort and would support the development of a global methane emission goal for this sector. We encourage other countries to do the same, and intend to communicate on our progress through international fora, such as the CCAC, Global Methane Initiative and the Arctic Council.\nCollaboration on the Important Role of Forests\nThe Paris Agreement reflected the importance of forests and other lands in addressing global climate change. The United States and the Nordic countries are determined to cooperate to support and incentivize developing country forest partners to conserve, restore and sustainably manage forests, as well as strengthen their respective efforts to combat illegal logging and associated trade, thereby contributing to the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions by both reducing forest emissions and enhancing sequestration. The United States and the Nordic countries will also collaborate to facilitate private sector efforts to eliminate deforestation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, cattle and soy. Today, the US and Norway are announcing that they will sign a joint statement to reinforce their intention to enhance cooperation on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and sustainable landscapes. As a signal of their commitment, this week the United States announced the first results and a detailed action plan to reduce emissions and increase carbon storage in soils and forests through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Building Blocks for Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry. Through this initiative, USDA committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon stored in forests and soils by over 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2025.\nPromoting Energy for All\nThe Nordic countries and the United States commit to further strengthen efforts to achieve global access to sustainable, reliable, affordable and secure modern energy for all, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This work will be pursued through a range of initiatives, including development support to mechanisms which seek to unlock investments in sustainable energy, such as through Power Africa as well as the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA). We also commit to work to further strengthen the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative through support to the ongoing process of developing a new strategy for SE4All and its implementation. In addition, the United States and the Nordic countries intend to promote access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by encouraging the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies, promoting renewable energies and fuels, and enhancing energy efficiency.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa alone, more than two-thirds of the population is without access to power. To support a doubling of electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa the United States and Nordic countries have expressed our support for the Power Africa initiative and commit to work together to provide technical assistance, financing, and other support to enable additional investment in energy projects throughout the region. Since the launch of the Power Africa initiative in 2013, the Government of Sweden has commited to catalyze investments of one billion dollars to Power Africa. The commitment represents grants for distribution and transmission projects, and guarantees and loans for renewable Power Africa projects. In December 2015, Power Africa announced a new partnership with Norway, which aligns the collective investments of the United States and Norwegian governments in renewable energy and expands off-grid and mini-grid efforts. Through this partnership, Norway is committing to bringing 1,500 MW online over a five-year period, contributing to Power Africa's overall 30,000 MW electricity generation goal.\nThe Arctic\nThe United States, the Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden affirm our commitment to safeguarding the Arctic environment while providing enhanced opportunities for sustainable development for all inhabitants of the Arctic, including indigenous peoples.\nThe Arctic is rapidly changing and attracting global attention. It is a globally unique region that provides livelihoods for its inhabitants, but is also one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Rich with opportunities for transport, tourism, energy, and innovation, the Arctic is characterized by close cooperation on a broad range of issues between the United States and the Nordic Countries, together with our Arctic partners Canada and Russia. Continuing to keep the Arctic region a zone of peace and stability is at the heart of our efforts. We reaffirm the importance of maintaining the Arctic region based on universally recognized principles of international law including those reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nThe Arctic Council celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, reaffirming its commitment to cooperation and coordination on matters of common interest among the Arctic States and indigenous peoples of the region. As the preeminent high-level forum among the Arctic States, the Arctic Council has proven instrumental in addressing new challenges and opportunities, while retaining a core focus on environmental protection and sustainable development.\nThe United States and Nordic countries will continue to work actively in the Arctic Council to ensure progress on shared priorities. The work of the current U.S. chairmanship and subsequent Finnish and Icelandic chairmanships will be closely coordinated to ensure effective progress on these priorities. We will strengthen our work, both within the Arctic and globally, to address the environmental challenges facing the region. We remain committed to managing the region with an ecosystem-based approach, which balances conservation and sustainable use of the environment. We are committed to the pursuit of international and national climate change goals. We will work towards the highest global standards, best international practice, and a precautionary approach, when considering new and existing commercial activities in the Arctic, including oil and gas operations.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are committed to recognizing the rights of the indigenous and local peoples and we reaffirm our commitment to the unique role played by Arctic indigenous and local communities and their traditional and local knowledge.\nWe will advance scientifically based protection and conservation of areas of ecologically important marine, terrestrial and freshwater habitats, taking into account ecological resilience in a changing climate and national and global climate and environmental goals. We are dedicated to promote the active involvement of the people of the Arctic in the management and sustainable use of protected areas.\nWe are committed to deepen the knowledge and understanding of the Arctic, both inside and outside the region, to strengthen Arctic research and transdisciplinary science, and to encourage cooperation between higher education institutions and society as well as synergies between science and traditional and local knowledge. The Nordic countries welcome the White House Arctic Science Ministerial.\nJobs, Growth and Trade\nEconomic freedom, open markets, and free trade are fundamental to maintaining prosperity and promoting welfare for our citizens. The Transatlantic economy is strong, and will remain at the core of the global economy. Together, the United States and the Nordic countries will continue to be a strong voice for open and sustainable trade and investments, and in particular commerce that embraces women's economic empowerment, innovation, and new technology. The Nordic region is among the largest foreign investors in the United States.\nDigitization and sustainable production have the potential to contribute to more competitive economies and to strengthen our industrial sectors. The United States and the Nordic countries will continue to show leadership in R&D, innovation, digitization, the provision of platforms for new technology, and the launch of start-ups, all of which create jobs, enhance competitiveness and pave the way for improving our businesses and societies. Innovation is also central to targeting key challenges, including climate change, health, gender inequality, and urbanization. Ultimately, innovation is about finding ways to achieve sustainable growth and sustainable societies. The United States and the Nordic countries will together promote innovation, including through the Nordic Innovation House in Silicon Valley.\nWe share the view that the multilateral trade system is crucial for the global economy and our intent is to work to bring the benefits of free trade and open economies to all. The United States and the European Union are working to complete negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) in 2016. We also look forward to exploring ways to bolster trade and investment among the United States, Norway, and Iceland. Deepening transatlantic ties through trade and investment is in our economic as well as our strategic interests. The conclusion of an ambitious and comprehensive agreement would lower barriers, create opportunities for small businesses, and boost economic growth and job creation through exports in the United States and Europe. It would also benefit the global economy and further increase economic integration.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries have committed to promote productive employment and decent work as key elements to spreading the benefits of globalization and reducing poverty. We are resolved, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to reduce inequality within and among countries. Rising inequalities have a negative impact on current and potential growth. We also recognize that promoting gender equality and increasing women's labor market participation rates are important elements of sustainable growth.\nThe Nordic countries and the United States have always enjoyed intensive people-to-people contacts and exchanges. We share a joint desire to boost these contacts further and to enhance collaboration in innovation, higher education and research.\nGlobal Development and Humanitarian Assistance\n2015 marked a pivotal year for global development. World leaders from more than 190 countries adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which sets out a global development vision and priorities for the next 15 years, and adopted the Paris Agreement, the most ambitious climate change agreement in history. Sustainable global development is fundamental for peace and prosperity, and is inseparable from democracy, human rights and good governance.\nWe are fully committed to support the global effort to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda). The United States and the Nordic Countries reaffirm the universality of the 2030 Agenda, and commit to implementing it, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, both domestically and internationally. The United States and the Nordic Countries also commit to continue to work together, and individually, to support the efforts of developing countries to reach the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including by enhancing developing countries' ability to mobilize and effectively use their domestic resources and to attract private sector investment for sustainable development.\nTo protect development gains and respond to urgent humanitarian needs, the Nordic countries and the United States intend to maintain a high-level of humanitarian assistance, including in response to drought, floods and other climatic shocks exacerbated or induced by the El Nino and the La Nina phenomena, with special emphasis on the needs of women and girls and vulnerable groups within any affected population.\nGender equality is a central human right and a development issue. The United States and the Nordic Countries have a longstanding commitment to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, particularly adolescent girls around the world who are held back from reaching their full potential. We will support efforts to ensure that adolescent girls are provided opportunities to continue their education. We will continue to promote the empowerment of women and girls by enhancing representation and opportunity especially through global education and health, as well as advancing and protecting their health and their sexual and reproductive rights. Additionally, reducing the barriers to education—such as lack of access, early pregnancy, the contraction of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, as well as harmful practices such as early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting—is critical to advancing the shared foreign policy, security and development priorities of the United States and Nordic countries. Universal human rights belong to all individuals regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The United States and the Nordic countries will work together in multilateral fora and at the national level to promote the protection of LGBTI people, ensuring that they can enjoy the same rights as everyone else.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are committed to high levels of development cooperation, and intend to work to catalyze further private investments for sustainable development.\nThe United States and the Nordic countries are committed to leading by example to fight corruption and promote transparency and accountability. We will support countries in efforts to combat illicit financial flows and help build capacity for civil society to aid in the fight against corruption. Tax evasion and corruption undermine development and drain public resources, and are fundamental development issues. As an important part of financing for development, the United States and Nordic countries will work together to support the Addis Tax Initiative and we will support developing countries in their efforts to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through enhanced taxation and new efforts to combat tax evasion.\nThe relationship between the United States and the Nordic countries runs deep. Our nations share a history of extensive societal ties that firmly bind us together. Through these strong personal and institutional bonds we will continue to promote our common commitment to freedom, democracy, universal human rights, and peace.", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Joint Statement of the United States-Nordic Leaders Summit"}

Connecting every corner of our country and each chapter of our Nation's story, our infrastructure has always played a critical role in helping us solve our shared challenges and in fueling the innovation and productivity that drive our economy. On National Defense Transportation Day and during National Transportation Week, we reflect on the importance of infrastructure throughout our history, and we recognize the need to invest in these essential pathways to our future.\nFrom the National Road envisioned by our Founders to the Interstate Highway System first authorized six decades ago, the history of infrastructure projects in our country reflects the belief that the progress made by each generation is built on the efforts of those who came before. Our investments in transportation systems have not only driven extraordinary and innovative advances, but they have also uplifted our Nation in times of great trial. Authorizing the construction of hundreds of thousands of miles of roads, the Works Progress Administration—established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt—played a major role in lifting our Nation from the depths of the Great Depression. And America would not be what it is today without structures like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Hoover Dam—defining symbols of the daring ingenuity brought about by the grit and unwavering determination of our people.\nIn our time, it is imperative that we carry forward this legacy by rebuilding our roads, transit lines, bridges, ports, and water systems. That is why my Administration has worked to repair and modernize our transportation infrastructure; connected more individuals, businesses, and communities across our country to high-speed broadband; and called on the Congress to commit to making the long-term investments in our infrastructure on which our country depends. And because there is no greater threat to our planet and to future generations than the peril of a changing climate, I have put forward a plan for creating a 21st Century Clean Transportation System to put us on a course to develop secure, resilient infrastructure that can reduce carbon pollution while strengthening our economy.\nOur transportation systems represent important parts of our history and heritage, but they are also critical to our safety and security, and ensuring they are stable and sound for future generations is vital. Our first responders travel our roads to confront danger and save lives; aid workers travel far and wide to bring relief in the wake of tragedy and devastation; and our Armed Forces utilize transportation networks each day to protect our Nation and our values.\nThis year, we mark 50 years since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Department of Transportation Act. Embodying both optimism for the future and a clear understanding of the work needed to shape that future, the founding of the Department of Transportation reminds us that America's progress has never been inevitable, that it has always depended on our people deciding, with boldness and vision, to renew our country's promise. In that spirit, let us reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling this tremendous task in the face of the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow.\nIn recognition of the importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and of the men and women who build, operate, maintain, and utilize it, the Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third Friday in May of each year as \"National Defense Transportation Day,\" and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as \"National Transportation Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 20, 2016, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2016, as National Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and to acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain it.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Proclamation 9446—National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2016"}

The high winds, heavy rains, lightning, and tornadoes that can come with these powerful storms cause serious damage, but with proper preparation we can ensure the safety of ourselves and our loved ones. During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we take deliberate action to safeguard our communities and work together to improve our resilience to hurricanes.\nOur Nation is better prepared than ever before for today's storms. Our technology, forecasting, and models have improved, and we have new ways of disseminating vital warnings and storm-tracking information. Still, it is never too early to prepare for a potential disaster. I urge all Americans to visit www.Ready.gov and www.Hurricanes.gov/prepare to find key information on building an emergency supply kit and knowing what to do when disaster strikes. By having a plan ready, with ideas about how to respond to warnings, you can help avoid tragedy befalling you and your loved ones. Our communities are not resilient unless individuals have taken proper precautions.\nHurricane intensity and rainfall are projected to increase as a result of climate change. My Administration is dedicated to ensuring our resilience in response to these climate change-related impacts. We are working with the Congress, the private sector, and communities across America to build climate-resilient infrastructure, and we are cutting red tape to help those in need of recovery assistance better navigate the environmental reviews necessary to ensure a rapid and resilient recovery. The Federal Government is coordinating with State and local governments to ensure their climate action plans are up to date and to mitigate the worst effects of hurricanes—including through making buildings more resilient, home elevations, and improving drainage—so people are in a better position to avoid loss, damage, and interruption of critical services, and so our communities are in a better position to recover from storms. As a country, we continue to make strides in achieving the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across communities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.\nThis past summer, our Nation commemorated the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina—a tragedy that claimed the lives of more than 1,800 of our fellow Americans. We all have a responsibility to step up and take action to protect our Nation from such devastating disasters. As we enter hurricane season, let us renew our commitment to that responsibility, and let us unite in common purpose to safeguard our communities.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2016, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in the areas of our Nation vulnerable to hurricanes to share information about preparedness and response to help save lives and protect their communities. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Proclamation 9447—National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2016"}

Enduring long shifts in dangerous and unpredictable circumstances, our Nation's peace officers embody the courage and honor that represent the best of America. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for the selfless public servants who wear the badge and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and we pay respect for those who lost their lives in the line of duty.\nIn moments of danger and desperation, the first people we turn to are law enforcement officers. These often unsung heroes risk their lives and sacrifice precious time with loved ones so their fellow Americans can live in peace and security. But more than that, they are leaders in their communities, serving as mentors, coaches, friends, and neighbors—working tirelessly each day to ensure that the people they serve have the opportunities that should be afforded to all Americans. In honor of all they do, we must give these dedicated professionals the support and appreciation they deserve.\nMy Administration continues to work to ensure police departments and other law enforcement agencies throughout our country have the resources required to hire, train, and retain officers, provide officers with modern and necessary equipment, and utilize technology to enhance their communication networks. And our Federal law enforcement officers regularly partner with their State and local counterparts to address some of our Nation's most difficult problems. We know that strong community bonds are essential for law enforcement to do their jobs effectively. I established a Task Force on 21st Century Policing, bringing together law enforcement, academia, youth, civil rights, and community leaders to provide concrete recommendations to enhance public safety while building community trust. Law enforcement officials care deeply about their communities, and together with our partners in law enforcement, we must work to build up our neighborhoods, prevent crime before it happens, and put opportunity within reach for all our people.\nBecause each fallen peace officer is one too many, I proudly signed the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act last year—bipartisan legislation that establishes a national \"Blue Alert\" communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers. The legislation seeks to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer's safety. I also announced new, commonsense gun safety reforms to help keep guns out of the wrong hands and emphasized that the already dangerous job of an officer is far more dangerous than it should be because it remains too easy for criminals and people who are a danger to others or themselves to have access to guns.\nIt takes a special kind of courage to be a peace officer. Whether deputies or detectives, tribal police or forest service officers, beat cops or Federal agents, we hold up those who wear the badge as heroes. Though they too often spend their days witnessing America at its worst, in their extraordinary examples, we see America at its best. On this day and throughout this week, let us celebrate those who nobly serve each day—and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice—to move our world toward a more just and safe tomorrow. May we carry forward their brave and selfless spirit as we keep working together to shape a future worthy of their commitment.\nBy a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as \"Peace Officers Memorial Day\" and the week in which it falls as \"Police Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2016, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2016, as Police Week. I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Proclamation 9448—Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2016"}

With over 95 percent of our Nation's potential customers living outside our borders, trade agreements are a vital part of our agenda for creating jobs and growing our economy—and smart trade agreements that level the playing field for American workers and businesses are a vital piece of middle-class economics. During World Trade Week, we reaffirm the importance of global trade, and we redouble our efforts to pursue trade deals that reflect American values and give our people a fair shot at success.\nAmerica's small businesses employ more than half of all Americans, and they represent 98 percent of our Nation's exporters. I am committed to a trade agenda that includes strong, enforceable provisions in our agreements that help our businesses—large and small—support higher-paying jobs and ship products stamped \"Made in the USA\" around the world. My Administration has ramped up enforcement of our trade laws like never before. Last year, I renewed and expanded the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, providing job training and other assistance to American workers. And earlier this year, I signed bipartisan legislation that helps us enforce our trade agreements—helping ensure that other countries play by the rules.\nSome of our greatest economic opportunities abroad are in the Asia-Pacific region. For more than 5 years, the United States negotiated a new, forward-looking trade deal that puts workers first and ensures we write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st century. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) brings 12 countries representing nearly 40 percent of the global economy together to trade and invest in the Asia-Pacific—one of the world's fastest growing regions. The TPP includes fully enforceable provisions that ensure a free and open Internet, respect intellectual property rights, protect the environment, and uphold worker rights. It eliminates more than 18,000 taxes imposed by other countries on American products, and it bolsters our leadership abroad while supporting good jobs here at home. The United States signed TPP this year, and I will continue working with the Congress to enact it as soon as possible.\nThe largest trade and investment relationship in the world is between the United States and the European Union—yet too many barriers remain in the way of even greater trade and investment between us. That is why, together, we have moved forward with the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), which will eliminate tariffs, simplify procedures, bridge differences in regulations, and cut red tape. T-TIP also enforces strong standards, and it will reinforce our larger trans-Atlantic relationship—the foundation of our prosperity and security since World War II.\nOur global economy's growth is fueled by trade. While understandable skepticism exists about trade, particularly in places that have been hit hard by trade deals of the past, we cannot ignore the realities of the new economy. Rather, we must set the highest standards for our trade agreements, enforce the commitments and obligations of our trading partners, and help write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st-century global economy, as we have done with TPP and will do through T-TIP. And we must continue to harness the dynamism and entrepreneurship inherent to who we are as a people and enable Americans to sell the best products and ideas in the world to every corner of the world. This week, let us renew our commitment to that mission and work together toward a future of greater opportunity for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2016, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/Trade and to observe this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate and inform Americans about the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-13", "title": "Proclamation 9449—World Trade Week, 2016"}

And welcome to this very special dinner as we celebrate the great ties and longstanding friendship between the United States and our five Nordic partners.\nPlease join me in welcoming President Niinistö and Mrs. Haukio of Finland, Prime Minister Solberg and Mr. Finnes of Norway, Prime Minister and Mrs. Löfven of Sweden, Prime Minister and Mrs. Rasmussen of Denmark, and Prime Minister Jóhannsson and Mrs. Ingjaldsdóttir of Iceland.\nNow, we all know that our Nordic friends share a pride in their common Viking heritage. But I think we can all admit that the Vikings could be a little rough. [Laughter] They didn't always have the best manners at the dining table. [Laughter] Their outfits were not always appropriate. [Laughter] But times have changed, and tonight our Nordic friends are much better behaved. [Laughter] We are honored to have you here. And as you can see from our decor, winter is coming. [Laughter]\nThis evening we have three toasts. So I'm going to be brief. And I don't want things to get out of hand. One of the great Old Norse poems, the Hávamál from Iceland, offered advice on how to welcome a guest, sort of like a Miss Manners for Vikings. [Laughter]\nLess good than they say for the sons of men\nIs the drinking oft of ale\nFor the more they drink the less they can think\nAnd keep a watch o'ver their wits. [Laughter]\nGood advice. It's perhaps easier said than done. It is true that our Nordic friends have a reputation today, unlike the past, for modesty and propriety. But don't let them fool you. In these Nordic countries, things actually can get a little wild. I understand that in Norway, for example, one of the big hits on TV is—[laughter]—\"National Firewood Night.\" [Laughter] This is true. A video of logs burning for hours—[laughter]—and hours and hours. That's crazy. [Laughter] Another show involved a video camera being strapped to the front of a train, so viewers could watch the rails for 7 hours. [Laughter] This sounds like riveting entertainment. [Laughter]\nSo we're not going to do anything that crazy tonight. [Laughter] But we are grateful for our friendship with the Nordic peoples, even if we do sometimes get a little jealous about how perfect they seem to be.\nIf you've visited any of these Nordic countries, everything is orderly. Everything is clean. Everybody is well behaved. It even prompted a best selling book called \"The Almost Nearly Perfect People.\" But there were some shockers. Apparently, Nordic countries can sometimes get into heated arguments about which country is happiest. [Laughter] They also do get into arguments about who has the better hockey players, until America steals them away. [Laughter] And they also have arguments about who has the honor of being the true hometown of Santa Claus. So these are fierce debates that take place among our Nordic friends. [Laughter]\nBut our work today actually does remind us of why we so value our Nordic partners so much. In each other, we find those who we work with in pursuit of common values that we cherish the most. We stand together so that citizens can live in security and peace. We labor so our economies can create opportunity where prosperity goes not just to the top, but to the many. Together, we're on the forefront of the fight against climate change, to preserve our glaciers, our fjords, to protect indigenous peoples of the Arctic. And in our own countries and around the world, we stand for the dignity and equality of all people.\nAnd many of our Nordic friends are familiar with the great Danish pastor and philosopher Grundtvig. And among other causes, he championed the idea of the folk school: education that was not just made available to the elite, but to the many; training that prepared a person for active citizenship that improves society. Over time, the folk school movement spread, including here to the United States. And one of those schools was in the State of Tennessee; it was called the Highlander Folk School.\nAt Highlander, especially during the 1950s, a new generation of Americans came together to share their ideas and strategies for advancing civil rights, for advancing equality, and for advancing justice. We know the names of some of those who were trained or participated in the Highlander School: Ralph Abernathy, John Lewis, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They were all shaped, in part, by Highlander and the teachings of a great Nordic philosopher. And they ended up having a ripple effect on the civil rights movement and ultimately on making America a better place. We would not have been here had it not been for that stone that was thrown in a lake and created ripples of hope that ultimately spread across an ocean to the United States of America. And I might not be standing here were it not for the efforts of people like Ella Baker and others who participated in the Highlander Folk School.\nSo that's just one small measure of the enormous positive influence that our Nordic friends have had on our country. It's part of the reason why we so value their friendship. I've said before—and I will repeat—they punch above their weight. And their values, their contributions not just to making their own countries function well, but making the whole world a better place makes them one of our most valuable partners everywhere in the world. And we are very grateful for the outstanding work that they do.\nSo I propose a toast: To the friendship between us and the values that we share. May our nations keep standing together and bending that arc of the moral universe in the direction of justice and peace and equality for all. Skål! Cheers!\n[At this point, the President offered a toast.]\nAnd with that, I want to welcome Prime Minister Jóhannsson of Iceland, to be followed by Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark.\nPrime Minister Jóhannsson. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, let me begin by expressing my pleasure of being here tonight, for your gracious hosting of the Nordic leaders and for the warm welcome you have extended to Iceland. We are honored to be here as allies, as partners, and most importantly, as friends of the United States. We bring with us the warm greetings and good wishes of our people. Relations between Iceland and the United States have always been strong. Our initial and ongoing defense partnership has blossomed into a broad friendship that includes deep commercial, academic, and cultural ties. And yes, that does sometimes include artists in swan dresses. [Laughter]\nOur friendship is based on solidarity and cooperation on some of today's most complex problems. Building on our 2013 meeting in Stockholm at today's summit, I am pleased, we have recognized the excellent Nordic-U.S. cooperation and shared achievements. I'm also pleased that we have committed in our joint statement to further deepen and broaden our cooperation on several key international issues.\nOur world views and interests align. We share the same values: respect for freedom and democracy, an unshakeable commitment to justice, human rights, and the rule of law. We are committed to the principles of gender equality and women's empowerment. We work together for peace and security.\nAs we near the end of your time in office, Mr. President, I would like to use this opportunity to commend your leadership, not least on the challenges of climate change, the conclusion of the Paris climate agreement, and on the Arctic.\nThe population of Iceland is a thousand smaller—a thousand times smaller than that of the United States. As you might expect from Viking-descended Northmen, we do not hide behind our apparent lack of superpower status. [Laughter] What we lack in manpower we make up in volcanoes. [Laughter] We are still figuring out how to aim them—[laughter]—however, so bear with us. [Laughter]\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to propose a toast: To the President, to the First Lady, to the people of the United States of America, and to the enduring friendship between our peoples. Skål!\n[Prime Minister Johannsson offered a toast.]\nPrime Minister Rasmussen. Mr. President; First Lady; dear colleagues from my neighboring countries; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen: \"Once, I was 7 years old, my mama told me, go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely.\" [Laughter] Those lyrics are from the Danish singer Lukas Graham's number-one hit song here in the U.S. And I'm a lucky guy because my predecessors didn't wait for this song to be released before they actually followed this advice.\nAnd therefore, I'm so privileged and happy to be here tonight, surrounded by friends from the Nordic countries, but first and foremost, you, Mr. President, and your fantastic and dedicated wife, Michelle, and all of your fellow Americans. The United States is truly one of Denmark's closest friends.\nThe first time you invited me into the Oval Office, Mr. President, you said that Denmark is punching above our weight. It made me proud. It made us Danes feel a little special. Now, some 6 years later, I understand that not only Denmark, but all the Nordic countries punch above our weight. [Laughter] But nevertheless, I'm still proud. [Laughter]\nAnd I truly believe the same goes for my colleagues. So you can count on us. And you know that. And that's probably why we are all invited here tonight, because we punch above our weight. And we will continue to do so. And after tonight's splendid dinner, we will definitely step up into a whole new weight class. [Laughter] The ties between the United States and the Nordics are strong and go way back. As you said, Nordic Vikings cross the Atlantic centuries ago and discovered amazing America. And ever since, millions have—and ever since, millions left our rainy and windy countries looking for a new start in America. Many of them settled in Minnesota. [Laughter] I guess the weather there made them feel right at home. [Laughter] And the Nordic settlers took part in making America bright and beautiful.\nScarlett Johansson, of Danish descent, is just a living proof of that. [Laughter] And the Swedes and the Finns and the Icelanders did their part too, contributing to the gene pool that gave you Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and Uma Thurman. And the Norwegians, well, they gave you Karl Rove—[laughter]—among many other things. [Laughter]\nSo I guess it's true to say that we have had a certain impact on America—[laughter]—in many different ways. So the good question is, can we Nordics still contribute to America? And the answer is a simple as it is famous: Yes, we can!\nNordic architects like Bjarke Ingels contribute to transforming American cities with projects like the New York Dryline and the redesign of the Smithsonian here in Washington, based on a vision of making urban areas more livable, smart, and sustainable. Both the U.S. and the Nordic countries try to set positive standards for the world of tomorrow, taking the lead, so to speak.\nAnd speaking of taking the lead, speaking of leadership, it is easy to see the importance and value of your leadership, Mr. President. So without interfering in American politics, I can truly and without a doubt say that you have been the best President Europe never had.\nNow your Presidency is coming to an end. And I have something to admit. I'm very fond of Donald too. [Laughter] I support him as a President. He's really smart, shows great leadership skills, a true visionary. And I'm, of course, talking about Donald Tusk, our Polish President of the European Council. [Laughter] Which, in your absence, is the best President Europe could have. [Laughter]\nWell, being a role model is not always easy, so I've heard. But you, Mr. President, have come to represent a dream for millions of Americans and people across the world. We share a common vision of securing good, affordable health care to all. And I greatly respect your achievement in this regard. Your leadership was also key to the Paris Agreement on climate change last year. And we continue—well, both of us were disappointed after Copenhagen, but then, we worked hard, and finally, in Paris, we succeeded. And we continue our work together on the green transition.\nAnd recently, Mr. President, you swept the White House in the rainbow colors. Being the first country on Earth to allow same-sex partnership, Denmark admires and supports your fight for diversity and equal rights.\nNevertheless, your Presidency is slowly coming to an end. So Congress will probably try to block both of your initiatives in the time to come. I guess that can be frustrating. Believe me, being leader of a very small minority Government, I know that from personal experience. [Laughter] And if I may, allow me to give you a piece of personal advice. When I get too frustrated, I let off steam by cooking. [Laughter] And I can recommend that. And if you do take my advice, I think you could be inspired by the new Nordic cuisine. It already involves edible rarities such as moss, bark, and living ants. [Laughter] But maybe you could be helpful in our search for a recipe for lame duck. [Laughter] Mr. President, you are a great friend and ally. Sólrun and I will always be very happy to welcome you and your family in Copenhagen. And Denmark would, as all the Nordic countries, I believe, be honored to receive one of the most inspirational and charming figures in America—along with her husband, of course. [Laughter]\nSo, dear Michelle, dear Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me propose a toast for the strong relations between our nations, the very special cross-Atlantic friendship between U.S. and the Nordic countries. To friendship. Skål! Cheers!\n[Prime Minister Rasmussen offered a toast.]\nPresident Obama. The dinner is now served. But I think we've just identified the next comic for the White House Correspondents' dinner. [Laughter]\nEnjoy, everybody.

McConnell, the senior senator from Kentucky and the Republican leader in the Senate, pulled the provision from the package, according to The Washington Post.\nSanders introduced a separate bill last year that would protect the pensions of mine workers and 1.5 million other workers throughout the country in troubled, multi-employer pension plans.\nSanders cited McConnell's role in blocking help for retired miners during a stop at a campaign field office here. It was part of a series of Sanders events this weekend in one of two states holding Democratic Party presidential primary elections on Tuesday. There are 55 pledged delegates at stake here and 61 in Oregon, the other state where Democrats will go to the polls on Tuesday.\n\"We cannot allow the pension and retirement benefits of the United Mine Workers of America to be slashed,\" Sanders said. \"When a worker is promised a pension we have a responsibility to make sure that promise is not broken. Senator McConnell should drop his opposition to this deal and save the pension benefits of more than 90,000 coal miners in this country and he should do it now.\"\nWatch the Video:", "timestamp": "2016-05-14", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Presses McConnell to Save Coal Miners' Pensions"}

Hi, everybody. I've got a special guest with me this week, Macklemore. Now, for those of you who don't share the same love [White House note: \"Same Love\" is the title of Macklemore's hit 2012 song about marriage equality.] for hip-hop that I do, he's a Grammy-winning artist, but he is also an advocate who's giving voice to a disease we too often just whisper about: the disease of addiction.\nMusician Ben \"Macklemore\" Haggerty. Hey, everybody. I'm here with President Obama because I take this personally. I abused prescription drugs, and I battled addiction. If I hadn't gotten the help that I needed when I needed it, I definitely would not be here today. And I want to help others facing the same challenges that I did.\nThe President. Now, drug overdoses now take more lives every year than traffic accidents. Deaths from opioid overdoses have tripled since 2000. A lot of time, they're from legal drugs prescribed by a doctor. So addiction doesn't always start in some dark alley, it often starts in a medicine cabinet. In fact, a new study released this month found that 44 percent of Americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription pain killers.\nMacklemore. I didn't just know someone, I lost someone. My friend Kevin overdosed on painkillers when he was just 21 years old. Addiction is like any other disease. It doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care what color you are, whether you're a guy or a girl, rich or poor, whether you live in a inner city, a suburb, or rural America. This doesn't just happen to other people's kids or in some other neighborhood. It can happen to any of us.\nThe President. That's why just talking about this crisis isn't enough. We need to get treatment to more people who need it. My administration is working with communities to reduce overdose deaths, including with medication. We're working with law enforcement to help people get into treatment instead of jail. And under Obamacare, health plans in the marketplace have to include coverage for treatment.\nMacklemore. I know recovery isn't easy or quick, but along with the 12-step program, treatment has saved my life. And recovery works. We need our leaders in Washington fund it and for people to know how to find it.\nThe President. We all need to do more to make that happen. I've asked Congress to expand access to recovery services and to give first responders the tools they need to treat overdoses before it's too late. This week, the House passed several bills about opioids, which is great, but unless they also make investments in more treatment, it won't get Americans the help that they need.\nOn top of funding, doctors also need more training about the power of pain medication they prescribe and the risks that those pain medications carry. Another way our country can help those suffering in private is to make this conversation public.\nMacklemore. When you're going through it, it's hard to imagine there could be anything worse than addiction. But shame and the stigma associated with the disease keeps too many people from seeking the help that they actually need. Addiction isn't a personal choice or a personal failing. And sometimes, it takes more than a strong will to get better; it takes a strong community and accessible resources.\nThe President. The good news is, there's hope. When we talk about opioid abuse as the public health problem that it is, more people will seek the help that they need. More people will find the strength to recover, just like Macklemore and millions of Americans have. We'll see fewer preventable deaths and fewer broken families.\nMacklemore. We have to tell people who need help that it's okay to ask for it. We've got to make sure they know where to get it.\nThe President. We all have a role to play. Even if we haven't fought this battle in our own lives, there's a good chance we know someone who has or who is.\nMacklemore. President Obama and I just had a powerful conversation here at the White House about opioid abuse and what we can do about it. You can catch it this summer on MTV. And to find treatment in your area, call 1-800-662-HELP.\nThe President. Thanks, everybody, thanks, Macklemore.\nMacklemore. Thank you.\nThe President. And have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-05-14", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Bernie Sanders capped a weekend campaign swing through Kentucky with a Sunday afternoon rally at the Julian Carroll Convention Center.\nMeanwhile, Sanders hoped for a heavy turnout in Oregon, where many voters already have mailed in their votes but others have until Tuesday to cast ballots in designated drop boxes across the state.\nSanders headed into Tuesday's primary elections in both Kentucky and in Oregon hoping to extend a string of victories the past two Tuesdays in West Virginia and Indiana.\nBuoyed by big turnouts at rallies like the 1,900 supporters in Kentucky, Sanders cited new evidence that he is much more likely than Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 general election.\n\"In virtually every national poll and in statewide polls we do better against Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton. We're seeing that all over the country,\" Sanders told the rally. \"Secretary Clinton does very well with Democrats and so do I, but there are a lot of independents in the country and we do very well with independents,\" he added.\nThe polling aggregator RealClearPolitics gives Sanders a 13-point advantage over Trump on average compared to Clinton's 5-point edge. Clinton edges Trump in eight of 10 recent polls. Her margin averages only 4.6 percent. \"Clinton vs Trump is a really tight battle, possibly in Trump's favor. However, on Bernie Sanders side, he beats Trump in every single poll and by an average margin of 14.1 percent,\" polling expert Dustin Woodard told Al Jazeera.\nIn another example, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found Trump and Clinton nearly even. That was a significant shift in Trump's favor in the previous week after it became clear that he is the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee. Just one week earlier, the same pollster said Clinton led Trump by 13 points.\nKentucky will elect 55 pledged delegates on Tuesday. Oregon Democrats will pick 61 pledged delegates who will go to the Democratic National Convention this July in Philadelphia.\nSanders was upbeat about his prospects in both states if voters turn out in strong numbers.\nIn Oregon, signed-and-sealed ballots that voters didn't put in the mail last week still may be hand-delivered to county clerk's offices or any of the 185 ballot drop boxes available at public libraries and other locations around the state.\n\"I am one of the most progressive members of the United States Senate and Oregon is one of the most progressive states,\" Sanders told KPTV-TV in Portland, Oregon, during an interview on Sunday. \"We think we are going to win in Oregon and it will be a very big victory if the voter turnout is high and people bring in their ballots.\"", "timestamp": "2016-05-15", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Campaigns in Kentucky, Urges Oregon Voters to Drop Ballots"}

R-U rah-rah! Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you, President Barchi, for that introduction. Let me congratulate my extraordinarily worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights, Dr. Burnell and Bill Moyers. Matthew, good job. If you are interested, we can talk after this.\nOne of the perks of my job is honorary degrees. [Laughter] But I have to tell you, it impresses nobody in my house. [Laughter] Now Malia and Sasha just say: \"Okay, Dr. Dad, we'll see you later. Can we have some money?\" [Laughter]\nTo the Board of Governors; to Chairman Brown; to Lieutenant Governor Guadagno; Mayor Cahill; Mayor Wahler, Members of Congress, Rutgers administrators, faculty, staff, friends, and family: Thank you for the honor of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution. But most of all, congratulations to the class of 2016!\nAudience members. We love you! [Laughter]\nThe President. I come here for a simple reason: to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question. [Laughter] I'm just kidding. [Laughter] There's not much that I'm afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate. [Laughter]\nThe truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. Well, now, it's true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year. But you are the first to launch a 3-year campaign. [Laughter] Emails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president. [Laughter] And I have to say that really sealed the deal. That was smart, because I have a soft spot for grandmas. [Laughter]\nSo I'm here, off Exit 9, on the banks of the Old Raritan, at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges. Winners of the first-ever college football game. One of the newest members of the Big Ten. Home of what I understand to be a grease truck for a Fat Sandwich. Mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers on your cheesesteaks—I'm sure Michelle would approve. [Laughter]\nBut somehow, you have survived such death-defying acts. [Laughter] You also survived the daily jockeying for buses, from Livingston to Busch, to Cook, to Douglass, and back again. I suspect that a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon after a late night at Olde Queens. You know who you are. [Laughter]\nBut however you got here, you made it. You made it. So today you join a long line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heights its founders could not have imagined. Two hundred and fifty years ago, when America was still just an idea, a charter from the Royal Governor—Ben Franklin's son—established Queen's College. A few years later, a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for the first class. And from that first class at a pub, Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest research institutions in America. So this is a place where you 3-D-print prosthetic hands for children and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean, renewable energy. Every day, tens of thousands of students come here, to this intellectual melting pot, where ideas and cultures flow together among what might just be America's most diverse student body. Here in New Brunswick, you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class and then strike up a conversation on the EE bus with a first-generation Latina student from Jersey City, before sitting down for your psych group project with a veteran who's going to school on the post-9/11 GI bill.\nAmerica converges here. And in so many ways, the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America: the course by which we became bigger, stronger, and richer and more dynamic and a more inclusive nation.\nBut America's progress has never been smooth or steady. Progress doesn't travel in a straight line. It zigs and zags in fits and starts. Progress in America has been hard and contentious and sometimes bloody. It remains uneven, and at times, for every two steps forward, it feels like we take one step back.\nNow, for some of you, this may sound like your college career. [Laughter] It sounds like mine, anyway. [Laughter] Which makes sense, because measured against the whole of human history, America remains a very young nation, younger, even, than this university.\nBut progress is bumpy. It always has been. But because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists, progress has been this Nation's hallmark. I'm fond of quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\" [Applause] It bends towards justice. I believe that. But I also believe that the arc of our Nation, the arc of the world, does not bend towards justice or freedom or equality or prosperity on its own. It depends on us, on the choices we make, particularly at certain inflection points in history, particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs.\nAnd, class of 2016, you are graduating at such an inflection point. Since the start of this new millennia, you've already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks and war and a great recession. You've seen economic and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work and how we communicate, how we live, how we form families. The pace of change is not subsiding; it is accelerating. And these changes offer not only great opportunity, but also great peril.\nFortunately, your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future. I'm confident that you can make the right choices, away from fear and division and paralysis and toward cooperation and innovation and hope. Now, partly, I'm confident because, on average, you're smarter and better educated than my generation, although we probably had better penmanship—[laughter]—and we're certainly better spellers. We did not have spell-check back in my day. You're not only better educated, you've been more exposed to the world, more exposed to other cultures. You're more diverse. You're more environmentally conscious. You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom.\nSo you've got the tools to lead us. And precisely because I have so much confidence in you, I'm not going to spend the remainder of my time telling you exactly how you're going to make the world better. You'll figure it out. [Laughter] You'll look at things with fresh eyes, unencumbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandparents and old heads like me. But I do have a couple of suggestions that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world. Point number one: When you hear someone longing for the \"good old days,\" take it with a grain of salt. [Laughter] Take it with a grain of salt. We live in a great nation, and we are rightly proud of our history. We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before. But I guess it's part of human nature, especially in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked and the economy hummed and all politicians were wise and every child was well mannered and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world.\nGuess what? It ain't so. [Laughter] The \"good old days\" weren't all that good. Yes, there have been some stretches in our history where the economy grew much faster or when government ran more smoothly. There were moments when, immediately after World War II, for example or at the end of the cold war, when the world bent more easily to our will. But those are sporadic, those moments, those episodes. In fact, by almost every measure, America is better—and the world is better—than it was 50 years ago or 30 years ago or even 8 years ago.\nAnd by the way, I'm not—set aside 150 years ago, pre-Civil War, right? There's a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about. Set aside life in the fifties, when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life. Since I graduated, in 1983—which isn't that long ago—[laughter]—I'm just saying. Since I graduated, crime rates, teenage pregnancy, the share of Americans living in poverty—they're all down. The share of Americans with college educations have gone way up. Our life expectancy has, as well. Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and politics. More women are in the workforce. They're earning more money, although it's long past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men.\nMeanwhile, in the 8 years since most of you started high school, we're also better off. You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better prospects than any time since 2007. Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance. We're less dependent on foreign oil. We've doubled the production of clean energy. We have cut the high school dropout rate. We've cut the deficit by two-thirds. Marriage equality is the law of the land.\nAnd just as America is better, the world is better than when I graduated. Since I graduated, an Iron Curtain fell, apartheid ended. There's more democracy. We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio. We've cut extreme poverty drastically. We've cut infant mortality by an enormous amount.\nNow, I say all these things not to make you complacent. We've got a bunch of big problems to solve. But I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history. And the reason America is better is because we didn't look backwards; we didn't fear the future. We seized the future and made it our own. And that's exactly why it's always been young people like you that have brought about big change, because you don't fear the future.\nAnd that leads me to my second point: The world is more interconnected than ever before, and it's becoming more connected every day. Building walls won't change that.\nLook, as President, my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States. And as citizens, we all rightly put our country first. But if the past two decades have taught us anything, it's that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation. When overseas states start falling apart, they become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores. When developing countries don't have functioning health systems, epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans too. And a wall won't stop that.\nIf we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, we've got to have the cooperation of other countries in a global financial system to help enforce financial laws. The point is, to help ourselves, we've got to help others, not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out.\nAnd engagement does not just mean deploying our military. There are times where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our allies, and we are in awe of and we are grateful for the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known. But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military and the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing. They can't shoulder the entire burden. Engagement means using all the levers of our national power and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges.\nYou look at something like trade, for example. We live in an age of global supply chains and cargo ships that crisscross oceans and online commerce that can render borders obsolete. And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed. That's one of the changes that's been taking place: jobs shipped overseas, trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage. But the answer isn't to stop trading with other countries. In this global economy, that's not even possible. The answer is to do trade the right way, by negotiating with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their environmental standards; and we make sure they don't impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual property. That's how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values, including human rights. And ultimately, that's how we help raise wages here in America. That's how we help our workers compete on a level playing field.\nBuilding walls won't do that. It won't boost our economy, and it won't enhance our security either. Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country, that is not just a betrayal of our values—[applause]—that's not just a betrayal of who we are, it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism. Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders and blame our challenges on immigrants, that doesn't just run counter to our history as the world's melting pot, it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe. That's how we became America. Why would we want to stop it now?\nAudience member. Four more years!\nThe President. Can't do it. [Laughter]\nWhich brings me to my third point: Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science—these are good things. These are qualities you want in people making policy. These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens. That might seem obvious. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Preach, preach!\nThe President. That's why we honor Bill Moyers or Dr. Burnell. I—we traditionally have valued those things. But if you were listening to today's political debate, you might wonder where this strain of anti-intellectualism came from. So, class of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be. In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. It's not cool to not know what you're talking about. [Laughter] That's not keeping it real or telling it like it is. [Laughter] That's not challenging political correctness. [Laughter] That's just not knowing what you're talking about. [Laughter] And yet we've become confused about this.\nLook, our Nation's Founders—Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson—they were born of the Enlightenment. They sought to escape superstition and sectarianism and tribalism and know-nothingness. [Laughter] They believed in rational thought and experimentation and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates. That is embedded in our constitutional design. That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers, the Edisons and the Wright brothers and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses. That's what built this country.\nAnd today, in every phone in one of your pockets—[laughter]—we have access to more information than at any time in human history, at a touch of a button. But ironically, the flood of information hasn't made us more discerning of the truth. In some ways, it's just made us more confident in our ignorance. [Laughter] We assume whatever is on the web must be true. We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions. Opinions masquerade as facts. The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel.\nNow, understand, I am sure you've learned during your years of college—and if not, you will learn soon—that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense. [Laughter] That's the truth. You'll meet them if you haven't already. [Laughter] So the fact that they've got a fancy degree—you've got to talk to them to see whether they know what they're talking about. [Laughter] Qualities like kindness and compassion, honesty, hard work—they often matter more than technical skills or know-how.\nBut when our leaders express a disdain for facts, when they're not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we've got a problem.\nYou know, it's interesting that if we get sick, we actually want to make sure the doctor has, like, gone to medical school, they know what they're talking about. If we get on a plane, we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane. [Laughter] And yet, in our public lives, we suddenly think, \"I don't want somebody who's done it before.\" [Laughter] Look, the rejection of facts, the rejection of reason and science, that is the path to decline. It calls to mind the words of Carl Sagan, who graduated high school here in New Jersey. He said, \"We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.\"\nThe debate around climate change is a perfect example of this. Now, I recognize it doesn't feel like the planet is warmer right now. [Laughter] I understand. There was hail when I landed in Newark. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President looked upward and gestured as a gust of wind blew, and audience members laughed in response.]\nThe President. But think about the climate change issue. Every day, there are officials in high office with responsibilities who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world's scientists that human activities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substances are altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways. A while back, you may have seen a United States Senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as \"proof\" that the world was not warming. [Laughter] I mean, listen, climate change is not something subject to political spin. There is evidence. There are facts. We can see it happening right now. If we don't act, if we don't roll—if we don't follow through on the progress we made in Paris, the progress we've been making here at home, your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe.\nSo it's up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate. Imagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that Senator with the snowball, what he would think. Imagine if your fifth grade science teacher had seen that. [Laughter] He'd get a D. [Laughter] And he's a Senator, somebody—[laughter].\nLook, I'm not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion or faith or love or loyalty. I am suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well and proposed budgets add up and our environment is protected. And to accomplish those things, to make collective decisions on behalf of a common good, we have to use our heads. We have to agree that facts and evidence matter. And we've got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they're talking about.\nAll right. I only have two more points. I know it's getting cold and you guys have to graduate. [Laughter] Point four: Have faith in democracy. Look, I know it's not always pretty. Really, I know. [Laughter] I've been living it. But it's how, bit by bit, generation by generation, we have made progress in this Nation. That's how we banned child labor. That's how we cleaned up our air and our water. That's how we passed programs like Social Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty.\nNone of these changes happened overnight. They didn't happen because some charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything. It didn't happen because of some massive political revolution occurred. It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy and organizing and alliance building and deal making and the changing of public opinion. It happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political process. So——\nAudience member. It happened because of you!\nThe President. [Laughter] Well, that's nice. I mean, I helped, but—[laughter].\nLook, if you want to change this country for the better, you've got to—you'd better start participating. I'll give you an example on a lot of people's minds right now, and that's the growing inequality in our economy. Over much of the last century, we've unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen, but over the past few decades, our economy has become more and more unequal. The top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all income in the U.S. In the past, it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the average worker. Today, it's 300 times more. And wages aren't rising fast enough for millions of hard-working families.\nNow, if we want to reverse those trends, there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference. We could raise the minimum wage. We could modernize our infrastructure. We could invest in early childhood education. We could make college more affordable. We could close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with childcare or retirement. And if we do—if we did these things, then we'd help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded, and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody.\nNow, the reason some of these things have not happened, even though the majority of people approve them, is really simple. It's not because I wasn't proposing them. It wasn't because the facts and the evidence showed they wouldn't work. It was because a huge chunk of Americans, especially young people, do not vote.\nIn 2014, voter turnout was the lowest since World War II. Fewer than one in five young people showed up to vote—2014. And the four who stayed home determined the course of this country just as much as the single one who voted, because apathy has consequences. It determines who our Congress is. It determines what policies they prioritize. It even, for example, determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate.\nAnd yes, big money is—big money in politics is a huge problem. We've got to reduce its influence. Yes, special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corridors of power. But, contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right, the system isn't as rigged as you think, and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think. Politicians care about being elected, and they especially care about being reelected. And if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views, you will get what you want. And if you opt out, or stop paying attention, you won't. It's that simple. It's not that complicated.\nNow, one of the reasons that people don't vote is because they don't see the changes they were looking for right away. Well, guess what: None of the great strides in our history happened right away. It took Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v. Board of Education and then another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. And it took a—it took more time after that for it to start working. It took a proud daughter of New Jersey, Alice Paul, years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation and writing letters and giving speeches and working with congressional leaders before she and other suffragists finally helped win women the right to vote.\nEach stage along the way required compromise. Sometimes, you took half a loaf. You forged allies. Sometimes, you lost on an issue, and then you came back to fight another day. That's how democracy works. So you've got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification, but you got to be a citizen full time, all the time.\nAnd if participation means voting, and it means compromise, and organizing and advocacy, it also means listening to those who don't agree with you. I know a couple years ago, folks—some folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement. Now, I don't think it's a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous administration. But the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State or shutting out what she had to say, I believe that's misguided. I don't think that's how democracy works best, when we're not even willing to listen to each other. I believe that's misguided.\nIf you disagree with somebody, bring them in and ask them tough questions. Hold their feet to the fire. Make them defend their positions. If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong. Engage it. Debate it. Stand up for what you believe in. Don't be scared to take somebody on. Don't feel like you've got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities. Go at them if they're not making any sense. Use your logic and reason and words. And by doing so, you'll strengthen your own position, and you'll hone your arguments. And maybe you'll learn something and realize you don't know everything. And you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe, but maybe what you believe. Either way, you win. And more importantly, our democracy wins.\nSo, anyway, I know—all right. That's it, class of 2016—[laughter]—a few suggestions on how you can change the world. Except, maybe I've got one last suggestion. And that—just one. And that is, gear yourself for the long haul. Whatever path you choose—business, nonprofits, government, education, health care, the arts—whatever it is, you're going to have some setbacks. You will deal occasionally with foolish people. [Laughter] You will be frustrated. You'll have a boss that's not great. [Laughter] You won't always get everything you want, at least not as fast as you want it. So you have to stick with it. You have to be persistent. And success, however small, however incomplete, success is still success. It's—I always tell my daughters, you know, better is good. It may not be great—perfect, it may not be great, but it's good. That's how progress happens, in societies and in our own lives.\nSo don't lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock. Don't lose hope in the face of naysayers. And certainly, don't let resistance make you cynical. Cynicism is so easy, and cynics don't accomplish much. As a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey, a guy named Bruce Springsteen, once sang, \"They spend their lives waiting for a moment that just don't come.\" Don't let that be you. Don't waste your time waiting.\nAnd, if you doubt you can make a difference, look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already making. Look at what Matthew has been doing. Look at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan, who began organizing antibullying assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination, and here at Rutgers, helped found the Muslim Public Relations Council to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion.\nLook at somebody like Madison Little, who grew up dealing with some health issues, and started wondering what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else, and so, here at Rutgers, he took charge of a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to address the AIDS epidemic. \"Our generation has so much energy to adapt and impact the world,\" he said. \"My peers give me a lot of hope that we'll overcome the obstacles we face in society.\"\nThat's you! Is it any wonder that I am optimistic? Throughout our history, a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom and more opportunity and more justice. And, class of 2016, it is your turn now to shape our Nation's destiny, as well as your own.\nSo get to work. Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last.\nGood luck. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-05-15", "title": "Commencement Address at Rutgers University-New Brunswick in Piscataway, New Jersey"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117430", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:07 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Hope you all had a wonderful weekend. I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to questions.\nKathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. I'm going to start with the Supreme Court decision or non-decision on the contraceptive agreement. I'm wondering if you view this move as a clear result of the vacancy on the Court, and if you have any thoughts on whether or not you think the Court is intentionally dodging contentious issues at this point.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that we obviously were pleased with the announcement from the Supreme Court today. It will allow millions of women across the country to continue to get the health care coverage that they need. So this obviously is an outcome that we are pleased to see.\nOur concerns about the continued vacancy on the Supreme Court persist. In this case, based on, again, the announcement from the Supreme Court, it's not obvious that an additional justice would have yielded a different result, but I haven't heard anybody make the argument that leaving the Supreme Court of the United States short-staffed is somehow good for the country. The argument that we've heard from Republicans is that they don't want to confirm another of President Obama's nominees to the Supreme Court, and they have made that declaration based solely on partisan reasons. And many Republicans are having a tough time explaining to their constituents why they refuse to do their job simply because the Republican leader in the Senate has requested that they do so.\nThere are Presidents in both parties that made a strong case for the Senate fulfilling their constitutional duty. And it was President Reagan who observed that a protracted vacancy on the Supreme Court didn't serve the American people well. And President Obama has made exactly the same case.\nQ: And as for the substance of the issue, are you confident that the administration and these groups can come to some sort of compromise at this point? Do you think there's a compromise to be had?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is the administration has put forward an accommodation that ensures that women, nationwide, have access to health care, including contraceptive coverage -- without pay, I might add -- while also protecting religious liberty. And we were pleased to announce this accommodation and to demonstrate that we were committed to both principles.\nNow, what's also true is there may be another process that plays out, because ultimately that was the announcement that's been remanded to lower courts. And we'll obviously continue to engage in the process. But we obviously are pleased that the announcement today from the Supreme Court protects the ability of millions of women nationwide to continue to get access to their health care.\nQ: Okay. And switching topics. On Libya, the announcement out of Vienna that the U.S. is backing the decision to lift the embargo and start arming the government there. I'm wondering if -- obviously this has been a decision that the U.S. was reluctant to make because of the concerns of these weapons falling into wrong hands, so I'm wondering if you could speak to why you're confident now that the government there can control some of these arms at this point.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think my understanding of the way that this process is working is that Government of National Accord that the international community has come to rally around is now in a position to make a specific request of weapons that they would like to see provided to forces in Libya that are fighting ISIL and securing the country. And the United Nations will review that request and determine whether or not that is a request that can be agreed to in a way that doesn't exacerbate our concerns that those weapons could fall into the wrong hands.\nSo this is the beginning of the process, not the end of it. But it is an indication that the international community is coming together in support of the Government of National Accord in Libya that's seeking to bring some long-sought political stability to that country. Libya has encountered some significant challenges.\nThey had an authoritarian dictator that ruled that country for more than four decades that eroded almost all of the remaining institutions that typically are needed to govern a country. And it means that the Government of National Accord is essentially having to come in from the bottom up and start building the infrastructure of a government to rule a country that's got a significant economy, particularly based on the natural resources that they can sell on the global market, and a populace that has been divided along tribal lines for a long time.\nSo this is a difficult challenge. And it's important for the international community to come together in support of this Government of National Accord so that the Libyan people can finally have the kind of government that reflects their preferences.\nQ: But as a sign of -- a vote of confidence in this government, should we expect that then, particularly in the campaign against ISIS, that the U.S. and the coalition will start to be more engaged in Libya? Should we expect more Special Operations or airstrikes, or is this sort of the first step towards an increased involvement in Libya on that front?\nMR. EARNEST: Ultimately, our goal would be to build up the capacity of the Government of National Accord so they could begin doing this work of fighting ISIL and securing their own country themselves. That ultimately is the goal, so that the United States and the rest of the international community doesn't have to come in and fight this fight for them.\nBut, as I mentioned, they are doing some very basic work that -- to sort of build up the institutions of that country. And it's going to require a lot of broader international support in order for them to succeed in that effort.\nSo the United States has already taken military strikes against ISIL targets in Libya, and when necessary, to take additional strikes to protect the American people, we won't hesitate to do so. So back in November, as a result of a U.S. military airstrike, there was -- the leading ISIL figure in Libya was killed. There was another strike that was carried out earlier this year that removed a number of ISIL fighters from the battlefield. These are fighters who we were concerned were prepared to go out and carry out a large-scale operation.\nSo we've used -- the President has ordered military action in Libya against ISIL targets in the past, and that continues to be an option. But that is not a substitute for building the capacity of a central government in Libya that can begin to secure that country and begin to take the fight to ISIL in that country.\nTim.\nQ: Just a quick one on the House invitation for Ben Rhodes to appear tomorrow. There's been suggestions that he may not appear. Could you tell us definitively if he will not appear tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, the answers that you heard from me before are still operative here. The truth is, it is Republicans in Congress who criticized the Iran deal, who have got a lot to explain when it comes to saying things about the Iran deal that didn't turn out to be true. And if they want to hold a hearing to determine whether or not Republicans were just wrong and badly misinformed, or if they were purposefully lying to the American people, then they can do that. There obviously would be ample time -- at least they should set aside ample time, because there are any number of witnesses, including individuals who serve on the committee, who could provide some significant insight.\nI think what's true is, Tim, that previous administrations have been fairly skeptical of these kinds of efforts, particularly because this isn't a whole lot more than just a three-ring circus that Republicans are looking to organize up there. And so I don't have an answer for you. We're going to continue to review the letter, but I think you can sense the not-so-thinly-veiled skepticism about this whole exercise that I'm displaying here.\nQ: But to be clear, he's not going?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a definitive answer for you. I don't have a definitive answer for you. Anything else?\nQ: Mr. Trump is saying that he's unlikely to have a good relationship with Britain's David Cameron. Does this have any -- does this jeopardize the relationship the United States has with Britain?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the individual presidential candidates express their own views about what they hope to do to strengthen our alliances around the world.\nPresident Obama, obviously, over the course of his tenure in office has invested deeply in our alliances around the world because of the important benefits those alliances bring to the American people, both in terms of economic security but also when it comes to our national security. And the President has invested deeply in the special relationship that the United States and the UK have enjoyed for centuries, and the President certainly believes that that's an alliance that's worthy of an investment.\nQ: Yesterday at Rutgers, we saw the President criticize policies of a certain Republican, one by one.\nMR. EARNEST: You're talking about Jim Inhofe?\nQ: No, not that one.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, okay. Well, he was the only one that was specifically mentioned in the speech.\nQ: On Mr. Trump's policies, is this kind of a signal that we're going to see the President open up a little bit more?\nMR. EARNEST: Mr. Trump wasn't mentioned in the speech, though, Tim. (Laughter.) Mr. Inhofe was, though.\nQ: Right. Is it likely we'll see --\nMR. EARNEST: I think that what I'm trying to illustrate here is that this is a -- the concerns that President Obama raised were not new but are concerns that extend broadly throughout the Republican Party. The President talked a lot about the continued insistence by Republicans to deny the fact of climate change in the face of overwhelming evidence and already-observed impacts. Republicans continue to deny that this is even taking place, and the President highlighted the example of Senator Inhofe, in the middle of winter, bringing a snowball to the floor of the United States Senate, and suggesting that somehow this confirmed his denial of science. Even years later, it's difficult to explain exactly what he was trying to illustrate.\nIt's not that difficult, however, to make clear what the President was trying to illustrate, which is that our country has long benefitted from political leaders that are not seeking to deny evidence and facts and science in order to advance a political agenda, but actually to focus on evidence and science and facts to make an argument about improving the country and moving the country forward and living up to the values that we have long fought for.\nThese are not new arguments that President Obama has made. For example, the President talked about the fact that, \"The biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation.\" I know that many of your colleagues, Tim, suggested that that might have been a shot at one presidential candidate or another. The truth is, that sounds like just a few more words for \"yes, we can.\" And I think what's important for people to understand about the President's speech is these are values that he fought for as a candidate for President and that he has spent the last seven and a half years fighting for in office. This has been his approach to problem-solving. It's been his approach to leading the country. It's been his approach to leading the world. And the country and the world are better off for it.\nQ: Just one more on the speech yesterday. While he didn't mention Trump's name, he did go after the wall policy and he did go after the temporary ban on Muslims. And I'm curious whether we might hear more from the President on Mr. Trump's treatment of women.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Tim, there are a variety of Republican candidates and a variety of Republican officeholders who have suggested that a religious test should be imposed on individuals seeking to enter the United States. And for the reasons that the President outlined in the speech, that is inconsistent with our values and it's inconsistent with a smart strategy to destroy ISIL. So, again, this is not an argument about one presidential candidate; this is an argument about many leaders in a political party that have eschewed evidence because it is inconvenient to the political argument that they want to make.\nThat's particularly dangerous when you're talking about something like the national security of the United States and the danger that the Republican strategy poses to our efforts to coordinate with Muslims in America and Muslims around the world to fight ISIL. Those are some of our most important partners. And to alienate them is unwise, to put it mildly.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You mentioned being satisfied with this ACA decision, the status quo is intact. But isn't this disappointing that it's going back and, at the very least, will probably lead to a compromise that is less than what you originally would have liked to have seen?\nMR. EARNEST: No, we were gratified by the ruling today. And this announcement does ensure that millions of women across the country can continue to have access to their health care. And it is a reflection of something that we have long believed, which is that it is possible to prioritize both access to health care for everybody while protecting the religious liberty of every American. That's what we sought to do, and we obviously are pleased that this is something that will continue to remain in effect.\nQ: Things could change at the lower court level, though. And I mean, in terms of trying to find a compromise, that could morph in a way that you might not agree with, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't know how the process is going to play out so we'll see.\nQ: Okay. And seeing how this was the result of an evenly divided Court, and looking at how this could have gone another way if the President had a nominee that was accepted prior to this, so do you expect this to just solidify opposition to taking up Garland? And I mean, in a sense, Republicans could see this as the status quo working for them in some ways. Do you feel like that's a possibility?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no idea what Republicans will conclude. The truth is, all the Democrats and at least a couple of the Republicans have concluded that Chief Judge Garland, the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history when you consider his 19 years of service on the federal bench, is somebody who is deserving of a fair hearing and a yes-or-no vote. It's even Republicans who have described him as a consensus nominee.\nAnd I did take note of something that Leader McConnell said last week that in some ways I think actually makes the case as strongly as anything that I've been able to come up with. Senator McConnell, speaking on the floor of the House of -- or I'm sorry, of the United States Senate -- and this is not something that we had to dig into the archives on and find on C-SPAN from three decades ago but rather something that he said last week. Senator McConnell: \"We are going to give the Senate every opportunity to do the basic work of government this year,\" he said. \"Some have said that because it is an election year we can't do much. I would like to remind everyone that we have had a regularly scheduled election in this country every two years since 1788 right on time. I heard some people say we can't do it because we have an election next year, and others have said we can't do whatever it is because we have an election this year. We have elections in this year right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.\" I think Senator McConnell said it quite well.\nQ: Okay. Now that we have sort of the fruits, we're seeing this happen now that we only have eight people on the Supreme Court. So how big of a concern is it that we're going to see this happen again and again?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it is unclear exactly what role the protracted vacancy on the Supreme Court had on this -- the outcome here, in part because the announcement reflected the unanimous view of the justices. Now, would they have been able to cobble together a different agreement if Justice Scalia were still alive and serving on the bench, or if Chief Judge Garland had been confirmed as he should be to the Supreme Court? It's very unclear exactly what the difference would be.\nI think what is undeniable, though, is that even Republicans have failed to make any sort of coherent case that the American people are better served by having a vacancy on the Supreme Court. That flies in the face of certainly the argument that President Obama has made. It also flies in the face of the argument that President Reagan has made.\nSo that's the challenge that we're seeking to overcome. And the truth is I think this is the -- this underscores the discomfort, the obvious discomfort, that Republican senators have shown in trying to defend their position. The fact is, there's no good justification for allowing this vacancy to persist. And it is simply a result of Republican senators refusing to do their job, and refusing to do their job at the specific request of Leader McConnell.\nSo again, I'm not exactly sure exactly what the broader Republican aim is, particularly when you consider the views of most Republican senators about both presidential candidates. But that's something for them to explain.\nQ: Okay. And speaking of presidential candidates, Bill Clinton as economic czar for Hillary Clinton -- is that a good thing for Democrats?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Democrats will have to decide. Ultimately this will factor in, I'm sure, into the decision that some Democrats will have to make in terms of choosing a nominee. I think what I can just say generally is I think those of you who remember -- and I think -- believe at least some of you in here covered the 2012 Democratic convention down in Charlotte -- you may remember a speech that former President Clinton delivered on national television in which he articulated an economic strategy and an economic vision entirely consistent with what President Obama has fought for in his seven and a half years in office.\nAnd I think the results speak for themselves. They certainly spoke volumes in evaluating President Clinton's legacy. They also speak volumes about the progress that we've made in this country over the last seven and a half years of President Obama's tenure in office, even -- again, after all, Leader McConnell himself said it best when he acknowledged that our country was better off -- is better off now than we were when President Obama took office. And a lot of that is because of the economic strategy that President Obama has pursued to grow our economy from the middle out, to be focused on the middle class, to be focused on job creation, and to be focused on the future of our economy that will be critical to our long-term success.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, in the aftermath of the administration's initiatives last week on transgender rights, one issue that remains is the ban prohibiting transgender people from serving openly in the armed services. Last week, Secretary Carter said the issue was complicated, which was detailed in a Washington Post report over the weekend on agreements on lifting that ban. Shouldn't the White House apply the same standard on the Pentagon for transgender access as it has done for education, health care and bathroom use?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I think that we have long acknowledged, even on issues that are relevant to the LGBT community, that ensuring the effective implementation of policies at the Department of Defense has higher stakes than it may in other government agencies.\nWe're talking about our basic national security. And what the Secretary of Defense has concluded -- and the President agrees -- is that qualified American citizens should not be denied an opportunity to serve their country just because of who they are or who they love. Our national security is enhanced when we can draw upon the skills and expertise and patriotism of every American.\nAnd that's part of what motivated Secretary Carter to conduct this review and seek the smooth implementation of a policy that would allow transgender Americans -- again, who meet the relevant qualifications -- to serve our country. But the smooth and effective implementation of this policy is not insignificant. And what Secretary Carter and the other services are conscientiously moving forward to do is to figure out the best way to settle on a policy and implement it effectively and as expeditiously as possible. And that's what they continue to work on.\nQ: Last week you said that the President was regularly updated on the developments of the joint guidance for schools on transgender students. Is the President receiving the same kind of updates with regards to the military service guidance?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President does have a regular opportunity to meet with the Secretary of Defense in the Oval Office when they both happen to be in town. It happens once or twice a week -- I'm sorry -- once a week or once every two weeks. And the President is updated on a range of issues that Secretary Carter is focused on. I'm not going to read out the details of every conversation that they have, but it's fair for you to assume that in those conversations the President is kept apprized as necessary of the progress of this review.\nQ: One such meeting is going to take place this afternoon, according to the President's schedule. Will the President, during this meeting, call on the Secretary to move forward with the conclusion of this review?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President -- again, I'm not going to walk through the agenda for their meeting, but the President continues to have confidence that the Department of Defense is handling this review as conscientiously as they should.\nOlivier.\nQ: Josh, is the President proud of his Syria policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I think the President is certainly pleased that the Syria policy that he has put forward -- and he's confident that the Syria policy that he has put forward and pursued has advanced the national security interest of the United States. What is also true is that we've seen terrible violence in Syria; it's an awful humanitarian situation and it's a genuine human tragedy. And it's a dangerous place and it's a place that poses a heightened risk to the United States and to our allies and interests around the world.\nThat's why the President and his team have spent so much time focused on how to confront that risk, how to counter that risk, and how to work with the international community to ultimately destroy ISIL. But there is no denying that what has happened in Syria has changed millions of lives, and not for the better. And that's a testament to the failed political leadership of Bashar al-Assad. It's a testament to the way that the political chaos in that country has propagated so much violence, not just in Syria but throughout the region. And people fleeing that violence have gone to far-flung countries around the world in a way that has been genuinely destabilizing to some of the countries where they've sought refuge.\nSo the long-term consequences of what's been happening in Syria are serious, but the President does believe that the way that he has handled this situation is entirely consistent with our national security interest.\nQ: So when Ben Rhodes tells Syria activists we are not proud of our Syria policy -- is that a fair characterization of how the White House views its own policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, again, I can't speak to any of that conversation. I wasn't there for that conversation, so I don't really know the context in which it came up. But I think the description that I have just put forward of the situation in Syria and the way that the President has focused on our interests in that situation are consistent with the way that Ben views that situation.\nQ: And at the risk of giving everybody whiplash, in the GQ: interview, the President was asked, \"Have you ever said, give me the JFK assassination files, I want to read them, give me all the secret stuff,\" and the President says, \"I got to tell you, it's a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that's top secret isn't nearly as exciting as you'd expect.\" Why not make it public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't looked at the documents, so it's unclear to me exactly what the equities might be. So maybe at the next news conference you can have the opportunity to ask the President that yourself -- which would be interesting. (Laughter.)\nByron.\nQ: Josh, Reuters is reporting that the U.S. is planning to make some changes in boosting investment and trade in its sanctions regime against Burma -- Myanmar. Can you explain what those changes might be and why they're being implemented?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements about our sanctions against Burma at this point. Obviously those are maintained by the Treasury Department. But we'll keep you posted if we have any changes to announce.\nRon.\nQ: Judge Garland's schedule this week -- can you give us some detail?\nMR. EARNEST: Judge Garland -- Chief Judge Garland is heading back up to Capitol Hill where he'll have a series of meetings this week. He'll be meeting tomorrow with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. On Wednesday, he'll have a meeting with Senator Hirono of Hawaii and Senator Udall and Senator Murphy. And on Thursday, he'll meet with Senators Merkley and Heinrich. So that is another six senators -- all Democrats this week.\nQ: No Republicans?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, no, I'm not aware of any meetings that he has coming up with Republicans this week.\nQ: Has there been any response to the questionnaire that was handed in last week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we did make note of the fact that this is a question that was a questionnaire that was accepted by Republicans and I believe posted on the committee website. So I think it's an indication that at least the American public now has access to even more evidence to illustrate why the President has chosen Chief Judge Garland to assume the important responsibility of serving a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\nQ: We have a team that's been doing some reporting about the number of Americans who are involved in ISIS, trying to join, being recruited, so on and so forth. I'm wondering, how big a problem does the administration see this as -- Americans -- I think the number is about 250 -- who have tried to join. There are a few dozen who have made it to Iraq and Syria. How serious is that part of the problem?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, when we've talked about our counter-ISIL strategy, we've talked a lot about the military aspect of that strategy, particularly as it's focused on taking ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria off the battlefield. And that obviously is an important priority.\nBut another key priority in which the administration has deeply invested is countering violent extremism and countering the efforts of ISIL to radicalize vulnerable populations around the world, including inside the United States. And we've worked diligently with community leaders across the country, include in the Muslim community, to counter the strategy that we know ISIL has, which is to recruit people from around the world to do one of two things -- to either carry out attacks where they are or travel to Iraq and Syria and take up arms in that region of the world.\nSo this is an issue that we take quite seriously. The good news is that when you consider the success that ISIL has had thus far in radicalizing Americans to their cause, that the percentage of people -- based on the sizeable population of the United States -- is much lower than it has been in other countries. But that's not a coincidence. That's a product of hard work, and we remain vigilant in countering those efforts because we understand the potential negative consequences of failing in that effort.\nQ: I understand there are investigations going on in just about every state. Does that sound about right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't have anything to say about any ongoing investigations. You can always check with the FBI about that.\nQ: And have you been able to develop a sense of who are the most -- is there a group, a region, a category of people who you think are most vulnerable to this? And is there any more specifics about what you're doing, or what law enforcement is doing, or what anyone is doing, for that matter, to try and combat this particular -- is the phenomenon getting smaller, bigger? Just trying to get a bit more about just how big a problem this is.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think as even your network's reporting shows that there's -- the people from all walks of life are potentially vulnerable to this kind of radicalization; that it's not focused on just one region of the country or on one specific community. And in some ways, that's what makes them so dangerous. This is a pretty amorphous effort that they have undertaken. Obviously they are able to use social media to interact with the world and that poses some significant challenges.\nOur countering violent extremism efforts are actually based over at the Department of Homeland Security, and they are focused on understanding the way that ISIL has used social media in particular to try to recruit people. We have worked hard to lift up the voices in the Muslim community that can effectively counter the radical ideology that's being propagated by ISIL extremists. But we can certainly get you a more comprehensive rundown from the Department of Homeland Security about what they've done to counter these efforts.\nMargaret.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about a development out of the Treasury Department today that certainly had some coordination with the White House in one of the implications for White House policy. The Treasury Department had disclosed that Saudi Arabia now holds $116 billion in U.S. debt. And I'm wondering, is it now going to be going forward -- the government's policy to release the Saudi data rather than keep it secret, as it had been for a few decades? And do you have a handle on whether that is the full extent of Saudi Arabia's treasury holdings? There had been a New York Times report that there was something like $750 billion in play that the Saudis were going to pull back if that bill went forward. Part three of my one-subject question is what's the state of play now with that legislation? Are you working actively to try to head this bill off? Is there actually a veto threat out there now? What's the state of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for the technical aspects of the report from Treasury in terms of what their disclosure schedule is moving forward, I'd encourage you to check with them.\nQ: But that's a shift in policy. I mean, you --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the Department of Treasure has indicated that that was the case. And those of you who follow these reports closely noticed the difference. So I'm not suggesting that somehow that there hasn't been a change in policy, but for how that policy will be implemented moving forward I encourage you to check with the Treasury Department.\nI haven't seen the latest legislative proposal from Congress as it relates to Saudi Arabia, but obviously the concerns that we have with the way that it was written when it was presented last month are still significant and I know that there has been some talk on Capitol Hill about potentially revising that legislation, but I don't know where that effort stands at this point.\nQ: Can you speak to the question of whether that $116 billion is comprehensive, or are you referring that to Treasury?\nMR. EARNEST: I encourage you to check with Treasury on that as well.\nQ: Can I toss out a Vietnam question?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit from the podium about how the President wants to mark the legacy of the Vietnam War when he goes and about this idea of him being at war longer than any other U.S. President -- largely because of issues that he inherited -- how he will address that broader topic in Vietnam particularly --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, last week, the President's National Security Advisor had an opportunity to meet with Vietnam War-era veterans and veterans service organizations to talk about the President's trip. And it's impossible for any American President to go to Vietnam without acknowledging the history between our two countries.\nThe truth is, there's a whole generation of Americans that proudly served this country in Vietnam. And I think the mistake that most Americans if not all Americans acknowledge that was made in this country at that time is that there was a tendency to allow political concerns with American foreign policy to interfere with showing respect and gratitude to fellow Americans who had put themselves in great peril to serve the country.\nAnd I think this President, like many Americans, is determined to make sure that that never happens again. And so I think you can anticipate that on his trip, the President will acknowledge that history but will do so with the courageous service of hundreds of thousands of patriotic Americans in mind.\nAndrew.\nQ: Josh, do you have a reaction to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's declaration of a state of emergency?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see that announcement from President Maduro. Obviously the reporting, particularly just over the last couple of days about the situation in Venezuela is breathtaking. The conditions for the Venezuelan population are terrible. And obviously we continue to be quite concerned about the wellbeing of the people of Venezuela. And we stand with the international community in expressing that concern. But the solution to these challenges will require the inclusion of all interested parties. And now is the time for leaders to listen to diverse Venezuelan voices and work together peacefully to try to find solutions.\nAnd the failure to do that only puts hundreds of thousands if not millions of Venezuelans at risk of further suffering.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask a couple of questions on two different subjects. One, ACA. With the months that you have remaining here at the White House, what are the lessons learned when it comes to ACA? I mean, you had the ruling today and then also last week you had another one about subsidizing insurance or subsidizing co-pays for some of the people who wanted it. So what are some of the lessons learned?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think certainly one of the lessons that we've seen from Republican critics of the bill is that they're going to stop at nothing to try to tear this bill down. But I continue to be confident that they're going to continue to fail. And as it relates to the district court ruling that we saw last week, it's unfortunate that Republicans have even resorted to getting taxpayers to foot the bill for their political efforts. That's disappointing and I don't think even some Americans who might be skeptical of the impact of the Affordable Care Act I don't think would appreciate that their taxpayer funds are being used in this way.\nSo we continue to have a lot of confidence in the power of the legal arguments that we've been making for some time. I think at this point the Justice Department has built up a pretty effective track record for our success in protecting the Affordable Care Act so that millions of Americans can get access to the health care that they've long been denied. That's a legacy that President Obama is quite proud of.\nQ: So the President himself -- early on, critics were saying things needed to change, and the President said he welcomed ideas about how to tweak it. Looking back, what are some of the areas beyond the Supreme Court issues -- or maybe even with the Supreme Court rulings -- that you would tweak in these waning months? And also, is there a fear that once this administration is over, number 45 comes in, that things could be different for ACA?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, we're quite proud of the record of the ACA. Every single month since President Obama signed that bill into law, our economy has created private-sector jobs. That's a pretty good track record, particularly when you consider that Republicans, even six years later, try to describe that bill as a job-killer. At some point, somebody is going to call them out for, again, either being wrong or lying. But there will be ample time for that, as well.\nThe legacy of the Affordable Care Act is 20 million more people now have access to health care that didn't before, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The growth in health care costs is lower than it's ever been in the history of tracking that measurement; that's more than 50 years now.\nSo we've made a lot of important -- to say nothing of the benefits that millions of Americans who had health insurance before the Affordable Care Act now enjoy because of the patient protections that are included in that legislation. No one in America can be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. Every child, every young adult in America is eligible to stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26 because of the Affordable Care Act.\nA whole range of preventative services are now available to Americans for free because of the Affordable Care Act. That's quite a legacy. And that includes millions of Americans that think that they're unaffected by the Affordable Care Act because they haven't had to go and purchase insurance through the exchanges, but yet they benefit in ways that have a profound impact on their family's budget and on their health.\nSo this is a piece of legislation that the President remains intensely proud of. And the legacy of this legislation is a stronger economy and a country full of citizens whose health prospects are enhanced because of this bill.\nQ: And with that issue of high deductibles for some of these insured -- is that anything that could be tweaked or looked at or viewed through a microscope? Because some people have complained about higher deductibles through this process.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, April, this is an argument that we've been making for six years. The health insurance market is a lot better for private citizens now than it was before the Affordable Care Act. That's just a fact. And I know that's a fact that Republicans like to deny, but it's the truth.\nQ: And my last question. There's this increased interest in Roswell. You're doing your dance at the podium about it. Is there a such thing? Are you -- look at you, you're drinking so you're trying to think. (Laughter.) Is there a such thing -- are you keeping quiet because of security concerns? I mean, are we to think that there might be life beyond here? I mean -- seriously. I mean, you need to answer this.\nMR. EARNEST: I'll just say, April, there are some questions that even the White House Press Secretary doesn't have answers to, and this is one of them.\nQ: You're not going to get off easy like that.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, you keep trying.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up on the question about Ben Rhodes and the possibility of making him available for Congressman Chaffetz. To just clarify, if nothing else, is it your opinion that his appearance would be, if nothing else, instructive, if not enlightening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have all of the available evidence that's necessary to evaluate who was telling the truth on the Iran deal and who wasn't. There are members of the committee who are not telling the truth on the Iran deal.\nSo again, if they want to hold a hearing, and they think it would be useful to get to the bottom of why they were so wrong about the Iran deal, then they're welcome to do that. They can start by swearing in Ken Buck, Congressman from Colorado, I believe.\nQ: You mentioned Tom Cotton, and he's going to do it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, yes, he's going to have a lot to say. I think he's going to get some pretty tough questions about all the things that he said about the Iran deal that didn't turn out to be true.\nQ: Absolutely.\nMR. EARNEST: Everything that Ben Rhodes said about the Iran deal did turn out to be true.\nQ: So then wouldn't it be at least instructive, if not enlightening, to have him go ahead and testify?\nMR. EARNEST: So you think that it's going to be a fair deal for people who lied about the Iran deal to question the people who told the truth? I don't think that's a very American approach to these kinds of things.\nQ: But I thought you suggested on Thursday that it would be a good idea to get to the bottom of it, and I'm suggesting that I think, based on what you've reported -- and I've heard you talk about this at length in some detail -- it would seem to help to get to the bottom of it if Ben Rhodes were part of the conversation. Would you agree?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, Ben Rhodes is the person who told the truth about the Iran deal, and it's Republicans who are either badly misinformed or outright lying about the Iran deal. And so if they want to explore that, they are welcome to do that. I don't really understand why getting to the bottom of who lied about the Iran deal requires somebody who told the truth about the Iran deal to participate. Let's just swear the liars under oath and let's see what they have to say for themselves. Maybe they can explain why they were so wrong about Iran's willingness to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Iran deal. Maybe they can explain why they said that Iran would never agree to the Iran deal in the first place, even though they did. Maybe they can explain why our international inspectors have been able to verify Iran's compliance with the deal. Maybe they can explain why they said Iran, in the case of Steve Scalise, would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief as a result of the Iran deal.\nThey've been wrong on just about every measure. So if they want to talk about that, and they want to come clean to the American people about what was going on when they weren't telling the truth about the Iran deal, then they're welcome to do that. I don't think that the person who told the truth about the Iran deal needs to be a part of it.\nQ: Just a quick clarification. You're not suggesting that Senator Cotton should lie, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I am suggesting that what he said about the Iran deal did not turn out to be true. And so was he wildly misinformed, or was he not telling the truth? Maybe he'll answer the committee.\nQ: You think it's the latter --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I don't know. But the fact is he, time and time again, presented a wide range of information about the Iran deal that wasn't true. And that's not just a conjecture, tha's something that we know as a fact. I'm just looking for the actual quotes here, because I don't want to -- I want to make sure we get this right.\nHe said -- this is Senator Tom Cotton on Meet the Press. So there's television footage of all of this. He said that \"This deal gives them $150 billion of sanctions relief.\" Not true. He was wrong about that. He said \"It puts them on the path to be a nuclear-weapon state in eight to 10 years.\" Not true. In fact, we will be able to verify over the course of the next 10 years and beyond that they are not advancing toward a nuclear weapon. And because this deal went through, they are farther away from having access to a nuclear weapon than they've been in about eight to 10 years.\nQ: I understand. I'm not trying to re-litigate the conversation. I'm just wondering if there would be more clarity if a guy of Ben Rhodes's information and knowledge -- intimate knowledge of the details, if that wouldn't be helpful. And if it would be, why not make him available?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess part of the reason is that there are administration officials who, on countless occasions, have traveled up to Capitol Hill to participate in hearings about the Iran deal. There have been literally dozens of congressional engagements about the Iran deal since January of 2015. The most recent example of this -- you have actually the person who's in charge of implementing the Iran deal under Secretary of State Tom Shannon, who appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he appeared there solely to discuss Iran and the Iran deal.\nAnd, in fact, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held an open hearing with the coordinator from the Department of State on this question back in February. I guess my point is -- and I guess the other metric here that I think is relevant is that the administration has provided classified briefings or appeared at open hearings to discuss the Iran deal more than 30 times in just the last 18 months. So if it were a matter of just one hearing that would convince Republicans to stop lying or to at least start telling the truth when it comes to the Iran deal, then presumably that would have happened in one of the first 30 or so meetings that we had with them. I'm not sure the 31st hearing in 18 months is going to get them to straighten up and act right.\nQ: Last one. Can you give me an accurate number of detainees at Gitmo? I've asked you I think once a week for the last five weeks, and previously you were super specific -- you said there were 98, or 104. But lately you've been sort of kicking the can a bit, saying, I'm not sure, I'll get back to you. No one has gotten back to me. Can you give me a specific number of detainees? And if you have any announcements about potential transfers that are --\nMR. EARNEST: Somebody will get back to you today, I assure you of that. I'm not really sure why that hasn't happened.\nQ: Thank you.\nQ: -- those numbers are surprising --\nMR. EARNEST: I will. It's not a surprising number. And I think that's the other part of this. Every time there's a transfer we announce it publicly. So if there's a change to that number since the last time that we spoke, that's something that you would have seen because we do make an affirmative public announcement every time that that happens. But I will make sure somebody follows up with you today to give you the specific remaining count.\nBill.\nQ: The chair of the House Appropriations Committee has introduced a bill for $622 million to fund Zika. It's all out of existing money and it comes with the statement again that the administration has failed to answer -- repeatedly failed to answer questions about where and how the money would be spent. Is it enough money? And are there questions you haven't answered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not that I'm aware of, because I do continue -- while sometimes I don't have the Gitmo guidance that Kevin is looking for, I have made a habit of bringing this with me. This is the letter that was sent by the White House to congressional leaders on February 22nd, detailing exactly how our $1.9 billion appropriations request should be used to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nHere we are, almost three months later, and we hear that some House Republicans have gotten around to considering a piece of legislation that is only about a third of what our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people.\nQ: Well, there's been some money spent already, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, not because Congress did anything. There have been some funds that have been reprogrammed by the Centers for Disease Control and a couple of other health care-related agencies that have been devoted to this effort. But that is essentially the bureaucratic equivalent of digging through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money. So the truth is our public health professionals shouldn't be reduced to doing that when it comes to something as critically important as protecting the American people from the Zika virus.\nI mean, the thing that I will say is that at some point this summer -- and we're probably not that far off from it -- there's going to be widespread public reporting about the threat of the Zika virus, and there will be questions, I'm confident, in this room by all of you, wondering why the federal government didn't more effectively plan to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And my answer then will be, we've been trying. The President held a meeting on this back in January. The President made clear the first week in February that we were going to have a specific request for funding. The administration put forward that specific request just a couple of weeks later in the form of the letter that I just held up. And we've not seen Republicans act.\nAnd I don't really know what the explanation is for that. I wasn't really aware of the fact that there was a partisan difference about the need to protect the American people from Zika virus.\nQ: The chairman is saying you still haven't provided full accounting of justification for the request. And given the lack of complete information, independent determinations on necessary funding levels have not been made. Any future funding now has to wait, he says, until the fiscal year 2017.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think that's going to be a satisfactory explanation to the American people when they see that pregnant women and babies across this country are at extreme risk because of the Zika virus. The truth is our public health professionals have had many conversations with members of Congress about what exactly is needed. There are countless letters that have gone back and forth, including the first one that I just held up from February 22, 2016. So if there was something in that February 22nd letter that Republicans in Congress didn't understand, why didn't they pick up the phone on February 23rd and ask about it? Waiting a day to deal with an emergency situation seems like -- I guess it's a legitimate question.\nBut here we are, three months later, and Republicans are making bureaucratic excuses about why they are not dealing with what our public health professionals say is a genuine emergency. And here's the thing. It's not just scientists and it's not just Democrats at the White House who have raised these concerns. I began my briefing one day last week by reading a letter from the bipartisan group of governors all across the country who are deeply concerned by congressional inaction and Republican obstruction to needed Zika virus funding. And we haven't gotten it, and the American people I think are rightly concerned about it.\nLook, is it going to require the onset of that emergency before Republicans act? I sure hope not, but that's the direction it seems to be trending.\nJuliet.\nQ: Josh, in terms of the nationwide guidance on transgender students that the administration put out last week, you and others have described it as a response to school administrators on the state and local level who were asking for clarification. And I assume there was some consultation with those officials. I was interested into what extent the administration, the Education and the Justice Departments consulted with top state elected officials in forming that guidance, whether anything was done on that front.\nMR. EARNEST: I think I'd refer you, actually, to my colleagues in the Department of Education and they can talk about the sense of outreach that they did to develop this policy guidance.\nAgain, the thing that I would just point you to is that the way that we can tell there was extensive outreach is that the guidance that was produced included essentially case studies of the way schools all across the country have dealt with this particular challenge. So those ideas didn't just materialize, they were a result from intensive consultations by the Department of Education to educators and community leaders all across the country.\nBut for the details of those conversations, I'd refer you to the Department of Education. Maybe they can provide you some more information about who exactly they consulted.\nJordan.\nQ: The President has now been at war longer than any U.S. President in history. Does the President or the White House have any reaction to that unexpected element of his legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not sure I would describe it as unexpected. I think those who listen carefully to the President's arguments as a candidate for President understood that he believed that the United States had been distracted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and had not been sufficiently focused on going after al Qaeda. And that's why President Obama ramped up the commitment that the United States made to decimating core al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And that was a mission that was carried out under very difficult circumstances by courageous members of our armed forces. And they succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda in that region of the world.\nBut what we also knew was likely to happen is that the threat from al Qaeda elements around the world was likely to be more diffuse. And we do continue to be concerned about dangerous al Qaeda elements in other countries. The dangers that they pose is different than the danger that was posed by core al Qaeda, but they are dangerous nonetheless. And the President has been vigilant about countering those extremist organizations, ordering the military to take action against them -- to take military action against them, all in the name of trying to protect the American people.\nAnd the success that our country has had in fighting core al Qaeda and in protecting the American people and in intensifying our ability to work with our allies around the world to do that is an important part of President Obama's legacy.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks. I just want to follow up on Juliet's question about the transgender guidance, as well. You said last week that this was not a direct response to what happened in North Carolina and the legislation there. Can you talk about whether you think that influenced the process at all? In other words, were you hearing from more educators, more folks who had been following this issue because of the public debate over that law, and some of your own Cabinet members were actually coming out and saying that there was a risk of North Carolina endangering its own funding?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's no denying that the scrutiny around this issue was increased dramatically after states like North Carolina took the steps that they took. I know that there was a referendum that was considered by voters in the city of Houston, I believe last fall, around a similar question. So there's no denying that in the last several months there has been increased public awareness of dealing with this issue.\nSo what precise impact that had on the process, again, I think I'd refer you to the Department of Education, because ultimately they were the ones who were formulating this policy guidance and they were on the receiving end of people seeking the guidance. But I'll just go back to where I started, which is that there's no denying that there has been a significant uptick in public consideration of these kinds of questions, and that included a broader public consideration of what kinds of policy responses were available to school administrators and local elected officials.\nSo that is a challenge that many of those school administrators are dealing with across the country, and the desire on the part of the Department of Education was to empower those school administrators with more information and more good ideas about what steps they can take to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school. That ultimately is the goal of administrators who are seeking to nurture an inclusive environment where their students can learn and get the best possible education. And the Department of Education is obviously fully supportive of that goal, and that's what motivated them to share this guidance last week.\nQ: To your knowledge, there wasn't any effort by the White House to say, we know this policy was under consideration, now it's time to move forward with it? Because there have been activists who have been asking for this for quite a long time.\nMR. EARNEST: There have been. But, look, this is a policy process that was the responsibility of the Department of Education. They obviously had to work closely with the Department of Justice because there were important legal questions that were raised. And as you'd expect, the White House was not just aware of these policy deliberations, but in the loop as decisions were being made to ensure that the guidance reflected the President's values and the President's preferences.\nQ: You're obviously aware that this issue has created a lot of discussion around the country. Over the weekend, you heard some praise for the administration; you heard a lot of outrage as well. Is the White House concerned that you've given the Republican base a campaign issue here?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not surprised to hear -- or I was not surprised to see that there were Republican politicians who were seeking to use this as a political tool. And I think this goes to the core not just of what we were talking about in this room on Friday, but it goes in part to what the President was talking about in his commencement address at Rutgers on Sunday, and that is simply this: People who serve in government have a responsibility to look out for the best interests of the American people and to ensure that our values are reflected in the way the country is governed. And too often, there's a tendency on the part of politicians to cynically use these kinds of decisions to score political points and to slice and dice the electorate. And that's unfortunate.\nThe truth is school administrators across the country are dealing with an actual dilemma that has consequences for the safety and dignity of every student at their school. So when the response from politicians is just to use rhetoric that's aimed at scoring political points, that doesn't protect any students' safety or dignity. What those school administrators need is practical advice. They need the legal interpretations. They need good ideas that have been used by school administrators around the country to address this challenge. And that's exactly what was provided by the Department of Education, and they did that in spite of the cynical political gamesmanship of a lot of Republican politicians across the country.\nQ: You mentioned the issue of safety. Can you explain why the administration moved relatively quickly on this issue, which carries the potential loss of federal funding, when, in contrast, on the issue of sanctuary cities, the administration, for eight years, has not threatened to take away a city's federal funding for harboring dangerous illegal immigrants?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think, as -- again, as we pointed out and discussed on Friday, there were requests for this kind of guidance that had been coming to the Department of Education for more than a year. And so I think that there were many school administrators who had been waiting a long time and urging the Department of Education to provide this guidance. I think they would have liked to have seen it arrive even more quickly than it did.\nLook, it's hard to keep track of the various proposals around sanctuary cities that have been put forward by Republicans. But the truth is, and the irony about this, is that it's Republicans who blocked comprehensive immigration reform legislation. So it's a little rich for Republicans to block the solution and then blame the President for not punishing cities who are dealing with the problem.\nSo, again, I think that actually is maybe even a better example of Republicans eschewing common-sense solutions because it might interfere with their ability to deliver a persuasive political message. And again, I think that's relevant to a lot of what the President had to talk about in Rutgers yesterday.\nQ: Groups of people like the Little Sisters of the Poor are saying that the return of the case to the 11th Circuit Court from the Supreme Court actually strikes down several of the key decisions it had made that hurt their case, and there isn't really precedent for the Supreme Court to do such a thing. So how can you say that you're gratified by the ruling?\nMR. EARNEST: The announcement from the Supreme Court today ensures that millions of American women all across the country will continue to enjoy the health care coverage that they have sought. And we're pleased about that because we care about making sure that women have access to the health care that they want.\nWe also care about making sure that we're protecting the religious liberty of all Americans. And we believe that's exactly the appropriate balance that our policy has struck. And we were pleased to see that the Supreme Court didn't strike that down. And that has preserved women's access to health care and it's preserved the protections for religious liberty that this administration has prioritized.\nQ: Women's groups are saying that now they have to wait. So the decision isn't really final. Now they're going to have to wait for more -- for that health care.\nMR. EARNEST: I acknowledge that, but while we're waiting, millions of American women all across the country will continue to enjoy the access to the health care that they and their doctors determine that they need.\nQ: And lastly, the federal judge declared that the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money to subsidize health insurers without obtaining an appropriation from Congress. Then hospital insurer stocks dropped -- the unanticipated costs of providing health care to customers on the states online exchange has prompted large insurers to seek rate increases. United Healthcare pulled out of Maryland. So wouldn't you say there's a negative trend happening with the law?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think that the positive trends are undeniable. Every single month since President Obama signed that bill into law, our economy has created private sector jobs. That happens to be the longest streak of private sector job growth in American history.\nWe've seen 20 million more Americans get access to health care because of the Affordable Care Act. No longer can a single American be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition because of the Affordable Care Act. Every young adult up through age 25 is able to stay on their parents' health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. Women can't be discriminated against just because they're women because of the Affordable Care Act. And millions of people across the country have access to a health insurance market that forces insurance companies to compete for their business, and that has led to better health care available at better costs for people who don't get their health insurance through their employer.\nAll of these are important positive benefits that are a direct result and part of the design of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe last statistic I'll share in some ways is the most important one, that we've actually seen the growth in health care costs held to the lowest level on record because of the Affordable Care Act. And keeping those costs -- or that growth in costs low has a positive impact on our economy, has a positive impact on the bottom line of businesses large and small.\nIt has a positive impact on the deficit -- all things that are important to this economy. And that's part of why the President made this issue a priority -- not just because of the moral question about whether or not having access to health care is a right. The President believes that it is, that every American is entitled to access to quality health care, but also because resolving this problem in the right way can be good for our economy and yield important economic benefits.\nAnd after six years, it's undeniable that that's been the case. And that hasn't stopped -- as I mentioned earlier, that hasn't stopped Republicans from resorting to all sorts of wild strategies to try to undermine the bill.\nI suspect the reason they're trying to undermine the bill is because they all opposed it. So it's a pretty cynical view on their -- a pretty cynical tactic on their part to try to undermine a bill that they opposed. Maybe that helps them justify why they opposed it, is if they can find a way to tear that law down and say, see, we told you it wouldn't work.\nBut the truth is they've been unsuccessful in that effort. There have been previous occasions where people have gotten excited and hope that, oh, well, maybe this will finally be the legal death blow to the Affordable Care Act. They've been wrong every single time. And as it relates to this specific case, I'm confident they're going to be wrong again.\nSarah, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. At the beginning, you suggested that the press too narrowly interpreted the President's comments yesterday in hearing them as being about Trump. You said they're about the Republicans more generally. At the same time, we've seen a lot of coverage kind of suggesting a lot of ways that Trump doesn't fit with GOP orthodoxy. So could you just articulate kind of the key areas where the White House sees Trump and the GOP as being in lockstep?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let you guys talk about Mr. Trump's campaign. We're going to be focused on what the President believes is important for the American people to consider as they head to the ballot box in November. And the President's opportunity to make that case in public will become more frequent when we actually are in the general election stage of the campaign. We're getting close to that, but we're not there yet.\nBut the President will have an ample opportunity to weigh in and make his case that the President who succeeds him is a President who is committed to building on all of the success that we've enjoyed over the last seven years.\nQ: Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee at this point. Why not use his name? And once he really -- assuming he does ultimately, officially have that title of nominee, will we hear the President speak about him by name, or in a more specific way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you pointed out, the President has on occasion spoken directly about his candidacy or some of this statements on the stump. And I suspect the President will do that again in the future.\nBut just in terms of people trying to understand exactly the message that the President was delivering to the Class of 2016 at Rutgers, it's important for them to understand the broader argument that the President was making. This is central to not just his presidency over the last seven years, but also central to the promise of his candidacy back in 2007 and 2008.\nAnd I think there's a remarkable consistency to the President's advocacy for these kinds of issues and a remarkable consistency to the President's arguments. And I think it's important for that not to be lost in the swirl of the ongoing presidential campaign.\nQ: Last question. There's been consistent discussion among Republicans down ballot about whether they should or could run against Trump or distance themselves from Trump. The way the Republican Party is right now, can people down ballot, or especially in the Senate do that authentically?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would just note the difficulty that many candidates have encountered in trying to do that. I know at least one candidate tried to draw a distinction between supporting a candidate and endorsing a candidate. If that's the best they're going to be able to do, then I wish them luck.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:23 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117500", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(Senate)\n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS)\nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2577, containing the text of the bills making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, services for men and women in our armed forces and their families, rental assistance for low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled, as well as its investments in programs that reduce lead-based paint hazards for low-income families with children. The Administration also appreciates the Committee's commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned, help reduce the claims backlog, support medical and prosthetic research, and provide the requested advanced appropriations. In addition, the Administration appreciates the bill's support of surface transportation priorities, including TIGER grants, Transit New Starts and Amtrak and passenger rail service. Furthermore, the Administration welcomes the bill's support of the Federal Aviation Administration, including the Next Generation Air Transportation System initiative, as well as key functions in the Office of the Secretary initiated in the FAST ACT.\nHowever, the Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds critical investments in ending homelessness and revitalizing distressed communities, leaving over 40,000 chronically homeless individuals and homeless families with children unserved, and failing to address the widening opportunity gap confronting the Nation's poorest neighborhoods. Additionally, the bill does not support the President's full vision for a 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that expands transportation options for American families, while reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil consumption, and creating new jobs. Further, the Administration is concerned that the bill includes provisions that would undermine the safety of the Nation's highway system and includes unwarranted restrictions on the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, as these restrictions further impede the Executive Branch's efforts to responsibly close the facility.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDivision A – Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT)\n21st Century Clean Transportation Plan. The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not support the President's vision for a 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that expands transportation options for American families while reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil consumption, and creating new jobs. The Administration urges the Congress to consider strategic opportunities to enhance revenue and investments to support a new, clean, sustainable transportation system and increase the competitiveness and productivity of the economy.\nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) New Starts Capital Investment.The Administration appreciates the support provided in the bill for this program but is disappointed that the bill does not provide the $3.5 billion requested as part of the Clean Transportation Plan. Such funding would increase the capacity of the Nation's transit network and help meet ridership demands in many communities.\nAmtrak and Passenger Rail.The Administration appreciates funding provided in the bill for Amtrak, rail safety and improvement programs but urges the Congress to support the FY 2017 Budget request of over $2 billion to support and improve our Nation's passenger rail service.\nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for the TIGER program but is disappointed that the bill does not provide the full FY 2017 Budget request of $1.25 billion to fund infrastructure projects of national and regional significance. Demand for TIGER has been overwhelming, with over $134 billion requested in more than 6,700 applications to date.\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Administration appreciates the funding provided for FAA, but is concerned with provisions that undermine FAA's ability to optimize certain services. The bill also misses an opportunity to improve airport infrastructure by focusing Federal grants to support smaller commercial and general aviation airports that do not have access to additional revenue while increasing the Passenger Facility Charge for all commercial airports.\nHighway Safety.The Administration is concerned about provisions in the bill that have the potential to undercut public safety, including section 131 of the bill regarding DOT's \"Hours of Service\" regulation addressing driver fatigue.\nOther Reforms. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for other reforms including providing $3 million in funding for the National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau and $3 million for the new Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center.\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOT to implement the Data Act. This funding supports the Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOT to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nTenant-Based Rental Assistance. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fund the Housing Choice Voucher Program at the requested level of $20.9 billion. While the funding level is sufficient to provide nearly the same level of assistance to families as in FY 2016, the bill does not fund the requested 10,000 new targeted vouchers necessary to make progress to end homelessness among families by 2020 or the requested $2.1 billion for Administrative Fees to improve mobility and ensure that assisted units are safe and habitable. However, the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Mobility Counseling Program, which would help low-income families access safer neighborhoods, better schools, and areas with more job opportunities.\nHomeless Assistance Grants. The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides only $2.3 billion in funding for the Homeless Assistance Grants program, which is $334 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. Although the bill provides $40 million for youth homelessness, which is $15 million above the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill does not provide the requested funds to support the Administration's efforts to end chronic homelessness among individuals or families with children.\nChoice Neighborhoods. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Choice Neighborhoods program, a key part of the President's Promise Zones initiative to accelerate economic mobility and revitalization in high-poverty communities. The Administration objects to the $80 million provided, which is $120 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. This would fund only 2-3 implementation grants in 2017, leaving dozens of distressed communities untouched. The Administration also opposes the requirement that implementation grants be awarded only to prior planning grantees, which would penalize communities that have invested their own funds in large-scale planning efforts and may be strong candidates for an implementation grant.\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Fee. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the proposed new FHA fee and provide the FY 2017 Budget request of $160 million for FHA administrative expenses. The request level would lower taxpayer risks and improve access to mortgage credit for underserved borrowers by enabling FHA to both strengthen and clarify its lender oversight and compliance policies.\nConnectHome Initiative. The Administration urges the Congress to provide the FY 2017 Budget request of $5 million for the ConnectHome initiative. The requested funding level would narrow the digital divide by facilitating high-speed internet access and providing digital literacy services to students and families in public housing, a population that faces numerous barriers in accessing the resources and skills needed to succeed in the 21st Century.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for HUD to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding would support the Department's efforts to manage and improve the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nConstitutional Concerns\nCertain provisions in the bill, including sections 188, 223, 405, and 406, raise separation of powers concerns.\nDivision B – Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)\nMilitary Construction. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for DOD's military construction and family housing requirements. The projects requested in the FY 2017 Budget reflect the highest priority projects for DOD.\nDetainee Matters. The Administration strongly objects to section 409 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. This provision would constrain the flexibility that the Executive Branch needs to be able to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA)\nVA Funding. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for our Nation's veterans and commends the Committee for including general transfer authority language. This funding would ensure continued benefits and services that our veterans deserve, though the $154 million reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request could delay needed repairs to hospitals and clinics.\nWhistleblower Complaints. The Administration objects to section 246 of the bill, which contains unnecessary and unworkable language regarding whistleblowers. VA has in place long-standing authorities, remedies, and programs specifically created to address claims of improper retaliation in the workplace, and the Senate is urged to eliminate this section from the bill. In addition, section 246 could raise constitutional concerns in certain applications.\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to implement the DATA Act. This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to continue support of a digital service team. This funding would support efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on veterans, citizens and businesses.\nConstitutional Concerns\nOther provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, sections 113 and 127 of the bill may interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-05-16", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: Senate Amendment to H.R. 2577 - Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117501", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Thornberry, R-TX, and Rep. Smith, D-WA)\nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. However, the Administration strongly objects to many provisions in this bill that impede the Administration's ability to carry out the President's defense strategy.\nH.R. 4909 fails to provide our troops with the resources they need to keep our Nation safe. Instead of fully funding wartime operations such as INHERENT RESOLVE to defeat ISIL, the bill would redirect $18 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds toward base budget programs that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not request, cutting off critical funding for wartime operations after April 30, 2017. Not only is this approach dangerous, but it is also wasteful. The bill would buy excess force structure without the money to sustain it, effectively creating hollow force structure that would undermine DOD's efforts to restore readiness. Furthermore, the bill's funding approach attempts to unravel the dollar-for-dollar balance of defense and non-defense funding increases provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2015, threatening future steps needed to reverse over $100 billion of future sequestration cuts to DOD. By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies.\nIn addition, H.R. 4909 would impose other unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to balance military capability, capacity, and readiness. The President's defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect. The Administration's FY 2017 proposals will accomplish this by continuing and expanding critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, balance growth in compensation, modernize military health care, and reduce wasteful overhead. The bill fails to adopt many of these reforms, including failing to authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.\nThe bill also continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay, would prevent the United States from fulfilling its obligations under a treaty, and includes non-germane policy riders, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act as well as public land management statutes, and those that would make it easier to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, which have nothing to do with national defense.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4909, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges the Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the bill's classified annex and working with the Committee to address any concerns on classified programs.\nReduction, Expiration, and Misuse of OCO Funds: The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to substitute $18 billion of the Department's OCO request with $18 billion of unsustainable base budget programs that do not reflect the Department's highest joint priorities. This approach creates a hollow force structure and risks the loss of funding for critical overseas contingency operations. This gimmick is inconsistent with the BBA, which provided equal increases for defense and non-defense spending as well as the certainty needed to prosecute the counter-ISIL campaign, protect readiness recovery, modernize the force for future conflicts, and keep faith with service members and their families.\nProvisions in the bill that would cause OCO funds in military personnel, operation and maintenance, defense health program, and working capital funds accounts to expire on April 30, 2017 are unacceptable. Shortchanging wartime operations by $18 billion and cutting off funding in the middle of the year introduces a dangerous level of uncertainty for our men and women in uniform carrying out missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Our troops need and deserve guaranteed, predictable support as they execute their missions year round, particularly in light of the dangers they face in executing the country's ongoing overseas contingency operations.\nCounter Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Efforts: The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to cut OCO funding for U.S. efforts to counter ISIL and to prevent the availability of critical counter-ISIL funds after April 2017. Reducing funding for train and equip activities in Iraq and Syria and cutting off funding mid-year would inhibit the U.S. military's ability to work with the Government of Iraq (GoI), the Syrian opposition, and other local forces to combat ISIL; interrupt ongoing U.S. support for forces on the ground in the middle of the year; and call into question the reliability of the U.S. commitment to support its partners.\nThe Administration also strongly objects to provisions in sections 1221 and 1222, which would further hamper the United States' ability to counter ISIL. A unified Iraq led by a multisectarian government is a U.S. national security interest, but the bill's approach for supporting the Kurdish forces contradicts stated U.S. policy of countering ISIL \"by, with, and through\" the GoI. Current policy has not inhibited U.S. support to Kurdish or Sunni forces, who with the Iraqi Army have reclaimed territory from ISIL control. In addition, the requirement that not more than 75 percent of the authorized funds under section 1222 may be obligated or expended until after the Secretaries of Defense and State submit a plan to the Congressional Committees to retake and hold Mosul limits the U.S. ability to respond to evolving needs of Iraqi forces as necessary to successfully support their campaign against ISIL. Finally, the expansion of a Secretary of Defense reprogramming certification requirement in section 1221 would add unnecessary bureaucracy, hamper the Department's ability to support the warfighter in a timely and flexible manner, and risk jeopardizing acceleration and effectiveness of the counter-ISIL campaign in Syria.\nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions: The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As the Administration has said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists. In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close. Rather than taking steps to close the facility, this bill aims to extend its operation. Sections 1032 and 1033 would continue to prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States or even to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees. These restrictions would limit the ability of the Executive Branch to take the steps necessary to develop alternative locations for a detention facility, and from fulfilling its commitment to close the facility at Guantanamo. The bill would also leave in place onerous restrictions on the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, and section 1034 would, in some cases, seek to prohibit certain transfers entirely. The President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation. These restrictions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy. Sections 1032 and 1034 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation of powers principles, and section 1034 could in some circumstances interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus.\nMilitary End Strength: The Administration strongly objects to sections 401 and 411, which would establish end strength levels above the President's Budget request for Active and Reserve Forces as of September 30, 2017. These provisions would force the Department to take additional risk in training and readiness of the current force, as well as investment in and procurement of future capabilities. In addition, the Administration objects to section 402, which would establish a new minimum active-duty end strength for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force as of September 30, 2017. Adding unnecessary end strength in the manner proposed in the bill would invite a significant, unacceptable risk of creating a future hollow force, in which force structure exists, but the resources to make it ready do not follow. The Administration urges support of the Department's plan, which reflects sound strategy and responsible choices among capacity, capabilities, and current and future readiness.\nTRICARE Reform: The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the transition to two TRICARE programs, TRICARE Prime and Preferred. However, sections 701 and 704 would eliminate almost all of the savings ($200 million in FY 2017 and $7 billion through FY 2021) contained in the Administration's proposal and instead add almost $1 billion in costs to the Defense Health Program. It also creates a complex system of separate benefits for members and retirees based on their dates of initial entry into military service. Further, the proposed pharmacy co-pay adjustments and reasonable enrollment fee for TRICARE for Life participants were rejected. The Administration believes strongly that the President's FY 2017 Military Health System (MHS) benefit reform package represents a reasonable and financially sound proposal for our beneficiaries. We look forward to working with the Congress on needed TRICARE reforms as part of a comprehensive package of MHS reforms.\nModifications to the Newly-Created Military Retirement System: The Administration appreciates the flexibility provided by section 622 and urges the Congress to support the use of continuation pay for service members with up to 16 years of service, given varying retention rates across career fields and the military departments. However, the Administration is concerned about mandating a 2.5 monthly basic pay multiplier for continuation pay for all members. Allowing DOD greater flexibility to adjust the timing and amount of continuation pay would allow military services to shape the force more effectively and efficiently.\nMilitary Pay Raise: The Administration objects to section 601. This section places restrictions on the President's authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed services at 1.6 percent basic pay, which would save $336 million in FY 2017 and $2.2 billion through FY 2021. The President's FY 2017 pay proposal would allow the Department to achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide competitive pay to service members and its responsibility to provide troops the finest training and equipment possible.\nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round: The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources. In addition to addressing every previous Congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis which demonstrates that the Department has 22 percent excess capacity. Additionally, the Administration's BRAC legislative proposal includes several changes that respond to Congressional concerns regarding cost. Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC will have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs; emphasizes recommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value); and limits recommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.\nRocket Propulsion System Development Program: The Administration appreciates the amended language to section 1608 of the FY 2015 NDAA to authorize up to 18 RD-180 engines, ensuring a necessary and cost-effective bridge to American-made launch services. However, the Administration strongly objects to section 1601, which would place restrictions on the funds to eliminate the Nation's use of these engines for national security space launches. The Committee's approach overemphasizes one component of a launch vehicle and, in doing so, risks the successful and timely fielding of new domestic launch systems. The Administration is committed to developing new American-made propulsion systems as part of these new launch vehicles, but this should be done in accordance with well-accepted systems engineering principles and not arbitrary funding allocations.\nThe Administration also strongly objects to the direction in section 1601 requiring the acquisition of Government purpose rights and technical data for any new rocket propulsion system. Complying with this direction is not feasible as it would likely require re-negotiation of the current development contracts, thereby delaying the delivery of the new domestic capabilities beyond 2019. Pursuing such robust data rights would also undermine the very nature of the public-private partnerships, require significantly more Government funding, and risk further industry investment and participation. The Administration's public-private partnerships are successfully leveraging willing private investment to develop commercially viable launch vehicles, and this has already saved taxpayers nearly $200 million, while maintaining access to the data that the Government needs. These partnerships could save taxpayers more than $500 million through 2019 and deliver valuable capabilities for the Nation and benefits to our economy faster than the Committee's approach.\nAvailability of Funds for Retirement or Inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class Cruisers or Dock Landing Ships: The Administration strongly objects to section 1024, which would prohibit obligating or expending FY 2017 funds to retire, prepare to retire, inactivate, or place in storage more than six cruisers and one dock landing ship. This provision would prevent the Navy from executing its phased modernization approach for maintaining an effective cruiser and dock landing ship force structure while balancing scarce operations and maintenance funding. It also would significantly reduce planned savings, accelerate the retirement of all Ticonderoga-Class cruisers, and create obsolescence of Air Defense Commander platforms resulting in a significant surface combatant shortfall in 2030. When compared to the cruiser phased modernization plan proposed in the FY 2017 President's Budget, the proposed language of this section would require an additional $3.2 billion across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) to fund manpower, maintenance, modernization, and operations.\nIn addition, the prohibition on obligating more than 75 percent of funds made available for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) until the Secretary of the Navy enters into ship modernization contracts would require significant reductions in manpower over and above the 25 percent reduction planned in the FY 2017 President's Budget for OSD, as well as curtailed spending for joint force readiness programs such as the Commanders Exercise and Engagement Training Transformation and the Readiness and Environment Protection Integration Program.\nLittoral Combat Ships (LCS): The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to increase the purchase of LCS in FY 2017 from two to three as noted in the table supporting Section 4013, Shipbuilding and Conversion line number 11. The Administration reduced from 52 to 40 the total number of LCS and Frigates (FF) the Navy will purchase over the life of the program. A combined 40 LCS and FF will allow for the Department to invest in advanced capabilities across the fleet and will provide sufficient capacity to meet the Department's warfighting needs and to exceed recent presence levels with a more modern and capable ship than legacy mine sweepers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft they will replace. By funding two LCS in FY 2017, the President's Budget ensures that both shipyards are on equal footing and have robust production leading up to the competition to select the shipyard that will continue the program. Both LCS yards will remain active for five or more years. This competitive environment ensures the best price for the taxpayer on the remaining ships, while also achieving savings by down-selecting to one shipyard. The bill prevents the use of resources for higher priorities to improve the Department's warfighting capability, like undersea, other surface, and aviation investments.\nCoalition Support Fund (CSF): The Administration objects to section 1212, which would make $450 million of CSF to Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority unless the Secretary provides a certification to the Congressional defense committees. We share the Committee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the Haqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the need for concerted action specifically against the group. However, the restriction in section 1212 would unnecessarily complicate progress in our bilateral relationship on this issue and would limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the U.S. national security interest. The Administration is also disappointed that the committee did not modify CSF authority to allow DOD to reimburse coalition nations that support U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and to counter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, as requested. This limitation could hamper the United States' ability to counter terrorists and to support our allies in the region, including partners who have the capability to perform the Counter-ISIL mission, but who lack the funds to pay for a deployment and sustainment of operations in Iraq or Syria. Lastly, the Department asks the Congress to retain the authority to make certain funds available to support stability activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as provided in section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 NDAA.\nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF): The Administration objects to the reduction of $250 million of CTPF in section 1510 because it would limit a valuable partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism. Reducing CTPF precludes DOD from continuing important security assistance programs begun in FY 2016. The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to authorize the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017.\nReduction in the Number of Navy Carrier Air Wings: The Administration objects to Carrier Air Wing Restoration in section 4303. The elimination of the tenth Carrier Air Wing proposed in the FY 2017 President's Budget optimizes Carrier Air Wing force structure to meet Global Force Management Allocation Plan demand, sustains the health and wholeness of Naval Aviation, and generates $926 million in FYDP savings. Additionally, if forced to retain the tenth Carrier Air Wing, the Navy would require an additional $48 million in FY 2017 for military personnel and an additional increase of 1,167 in end strength above the objectionable end strength increase already in the bill.\nJoint Intelligence Analysis Complex (JIAC): The Administration strongly objects to the bill's omission from section 2301(b) of authorization for expending funds associated with the $53.1 million needed for phase three (of three) of construction of the JIAC at Royal Air Force (RAF) Croughton, United Kingdom. This important project recapitalizes critically deficient facilities by consolidating and relocating RAF Molesworth operations and missions in support of United States European Command (USEUCOM), United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Administration also strongly objects to section 1623, which would restrict the Department's hiring of critically-needed intelligence professionals specializing in Russia at a time when the Russian threat to the United States and our European allies is increasing and requires redoubled intelligence collaboration. In March 2016, pursuant to requirements in the FY 2016 NDAA, the FY 2016 Intelligence Authorization Act, and the FY 2016 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, the Department certified that RAF Croughton remains the optimal location for recapitalization of the JIAC, that Lajes Air Field in Portugal is not an optimal location for the JIAC, and there are no alternative uses for Lajes Air Field. Delays in the JIAC project jeopardize $74 million in annual savings that will be achieved once RAF Molesworth and RAF Alconbury, which currently host and support the USEUCOM/USAFRICOM/NATO intelligence mission, are able to close as scheduled.\nAlternative Fuels: The Administration strongly objects to section 311, which would dilute the public policy established by section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (contracting requirements for alternative or synthetic fuel) -- a law passed with strong bipartisan support that provides a sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels. A diverse approach to energy security, one that includes both conventional and new sources, will benefit the economy and enhance our military capability.\nLimitation on Availability of Funds for Acceleration of Nuclear Weapons Dismantlement: The Administration strongly objects to section 3118 which puts unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the President to exercise his responsibilities to manage the nuclear arsenal. The Administration also strongly objects to the reduction in funding for accelerated dismantlement of retired nuclear warheads. The United States has a considerable backlog of retired warheads awaiting dismantlement that are no longer needed for military purposes. Funding for accelerated dismantlement is important both to appropriately manage the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a safe and effective way and to demonstrate continued U.S. commitment to our nonproliferation and disarmament commitments.\nUndermining Federal Oversight: The bill would hinder the effective oversight of critical nuclear security, safety, and environmental management programs, including: weapons modernization, nuclear nonproliferation, physical and cyber security, as well as cleanup and project management activities. Section 3116 and section 3117 would limit expenditures for salaries and program direction until the Secretary of Energy submits specific plans to Congress. These restrictions, coupled with authorized funding levels $40 million below the President's request for National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) staffing, threaten the ability of the Department of Energy to recruit, maintain and train Federal staff to oversee the management of the nuclear security enterprise and the legacy of waste and contamination from nuclear weapons production. Relative to 2011, NNSA's workforce is 17 percent smaller despite an 18 percent increase in program funding. One measure of this imbalance of staffing-to-workload relates to the acquisition workforce. For NNSA, each Federal acquisition professional manages an average of $116 million of program dollars compared to the Government average of $10.7 million.\nThe Administration is concerned about section 3117, which would hold back 10 percent of program direction funds within the defense environmental cleanup program as a penalty until the submission of a report that presupposes the President's Budget request for future years. This provision infringes upon the Department's ability to manage its Federal workforce by arbitrarily limiting the expending of program direction funds that are used to pay salaries of workers who provide critically important Federal oversight at environmental cleanup sites across the country.\nProhibition on Availability of Funds for Provision of Certain Assistance to Russian Federation: The Administration strongly objects to section 3115, which would prohibit the use of funds for nuclear security activities in Russia unless the activities are \"new and emergency\" in nature, and unless the Department certifies that it has no backlog of deferred maintenance to physical security equipment and its own defense nuclear facilities. Effectively a blanket prohibition on nuclear security cooperation with Russia, this provision would prevent the United States from addressing nuclear security concerns by improving physical security at certain Russian nuclear sites, which is an essential element of U.S. global efforts to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism.\nNonproliferation Construction Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration appreciates the provisional flexibility in section 3113 to terminate the MOX approach to plutonium disposition, once certain conditions are met. However, the Administration objects to a delay in funding the alternative plutonium disposition option and the effort to require continued construction in support of the MOX approach. Continuing construction, even temporarily, will result in additional millions of dollars being wasted rather than being directed to the alternative disposition method. The already-proven alternative method of disposition is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the MOX approach and has far lower risks. Another important consideration is that the alternative to MOX would likely enable the United States to remove plutonium from South Carolina decades sooner than MOX could.\nNon-applicability of Certain Executive Orders to DOD and NNSA: The Administration strongly objects to section 1095, which would roll back important safeguards established by the President to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not reward corporations that break labor laws and thereby jeopardize the performance and cost of Federal contracting. These safeguards give Federal contracting officers the information they need to assess a contractor's record of integrity and assist contractors with significant labor violations in improving their labor law compliance. In doing so, these protections help ensure that law-abiding contractors do not have to compete with those who offer lower bids based on savings from skirting the law. The Administration is committed to working with contractors who invest in their workers' safety and maintain a fair and equitable workplace, and section 1095 would impede efforts that will bring efficiencies and cost savings to the Federal Government.\nMissile Defense Programs: While appreciating the Committee's support of DOD's ballistic missile defense programs, the Administration strongly objects to section 1656, which would require the initiation of concept definition, design, research, development, and engineering evaluation and testing for a space-based intercept and defeat layer and space test bed. There currently is no requirement for a space-based intercept and there are concerns about the technical feasibility and long-term affordability of interceptors in space. In addition, the Administration objects to section 1663, which would direct the Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to issue a request for proposal to procure a medium-range discrimination radar or equivalent sensor for the defense of Hawaii. DOD is conducting a study to determine the appropriate balance of sensors and locations to best defend the homeland, including Hawaii; it will be completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2016. Section 1663 could limit the Administration's ability to defend the entire homeland and the flexibility to apply the best capabilities to address rapidly evolving threats.\nLimitation on Availability of Funds for Patriot Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Capability of the Army: The Administration objects to section 1658, which would infringe on the authority of the Secretary of the Army to set forth, approve, and execute requirements. It also would limit the Army's flexibility to trade cost and performance with schedule to ensure a system is fielded that meets requirements.\nProhibition on Availability of Funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction System (CWMD) Constellation: The Administration objects to section 216, which would prohibit the obligation and expenditure of any funds in FY 2017 for research, development, and prototyping of the CWMD situational awareness information system known as \"Constellation.\" DOD is developing and fielding a CWMD situational awareness system in response to requirements articulated by all combatant commands and validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. This capability is critical to anticipating weapons of mass destruction threats from nation-state and non-state actors and sharing information between DOD and its U.S. interagency and international partners. The Constellation system will be deployed in July 2016 as a development prototype. Prohibiting use of FY 2017 funds effectively terminates this important initiative.\nDefense Planning Guidance and Contingency Planning Guidance Information to Congress: The Administration strongly objects to provisions of section 904, which would direct the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Congressional defense Committees copies and detailed summaries of classified aspects of defense planning guidance, raising constitutional concerns. The defense planning guidance informs the Department's internal force planning, resourcing, and acquisition processes, which collectively support the annual development and submission of the President's Budget. Release of this guidance risks impairing the confidentiality of the Secretary's direction to Departmental Components, which contain sensitive national security information protected by executive privilege, and which directly informs both the development of Components' Program Objective Memorandums and decisions affecting Departmental programs in the Program and Budget Review process. Regarding contingency planning, information about potential future military operations used in the preparation of contingency plans is limited even within the Department to those individuals having a mission-critical role in the production, review, or execution of those plans or operations. Release of this information would interfere with the prerogative of the President and the Secretary of Defense to communicate direction to subordinate military commanders containing sensitive national security information that is protected by executive privilege. In addition, the required inclusion in the guidance of \"any additional or alternative views of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including any military assessment of risks associated with the defense strategy,\" risks impairment of the Department's programs by compromising the candor and confidentiality of pre-decisional advice given to the Secretary of Defense and the President.\nRole of Military Medical Treatment Facilities and Changes in Their Management: The Administration objects to provisions in sections 702 and 703. Section 702 realigns the management of Service military treatment facilities (MTFs) to the Director, Defense Health Agency (DHA). This section raises serious concerns regarding reporting chains to Service commands and DHA. While this proposal seeks to gain standardization by centralizing decision authority, the integration of the Services' MTF operating systems under the DHA would incur very high costs and would compromise the effectiveness of the MTFs as readiness platforms supporting the operational warfighter. Section 703 defines criteria for MTF types based on the availability of civilian health care in the surrounding geographical areas without regard to the readiness requirements of military medical providers. Both of these provisions raise serious concerns about the interplay between operational readiness requirements and health delivery. The Department looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve comprehensive reform of the Military Health System that carefully considers all of these matters.\nMilitary Response Options to Russian Federation Violation of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty: The Administration strongly objects to section 1232 which makes some DOD funding in support of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) contingent upon submission of a report by the Secretary of Defense. DOD provides support to the EOP that is entirely unrelated to the INF Treaty, including the White House Military Office that provides direct support to the President for transportation, communications, and emergency medical services. Limiting these funds will also have a negative impact on the ability of the EOP to manage and oversee vital national security defense policy development and implementation.\nOpen Skies Treaty: The Administration strongly objects to section 1231, which would effectively prohibit the expenditure of funds pertaining to the Open Skies Treaty. This would preclude U.S. participation in certification of Russian infra-red (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, which in turn would prevent the United States from objecting to the certification of these aircraft and sensors. Meanwhile, other State Parties could certify a Russian aircraft equipped with IR and SAR sensors. Section 1231 would also prohibit the expenditure of funds to accept an initial Russian observation flight equipped with IR and SAR sensors, preventing the United States from fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty, which was ratified by the President and for which the Senate provided its advice and overwhelming consent. Also, the 14 day reporting requirement imposed by the NDAA would be impossible to meet because treaty procedures allow 15 days for data processing to verify treaty compliance, and the Department would need additional time to transport and analyze the data.\nNew START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty): The Administration strongly objects to section 1645, which would make the obligation and expenditure of DOD funds to extend the New START Treaty dependent upon the submission of onerous and duplicative reporting on arms control and military balance issues. This provision would impede the United States from exercising an existing right under the Treaty, which was ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate in 2010. With implementation of the Treaty well underway, a decision to extend the Treaty in order to constrain Russia's strategic nuclear forces for an additional five years rests with the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief. In addition, section 1645 would require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to report to Congress on the Treaty's national security value to the United States, a determination that should take into account the views of the entire Executive Branch, including the Intelligence Community (IC). Similarly, this provision assigns to the Director of National Intelligence the sole responsibility to report on Russia's compliance with its arms control obligations. Section 403 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2593a), already requires a report by the President on Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments. By Executive Order, the State Department produces and submits to Congress this report, in coordination with the Departments of Defense and Energy, as well as the IC.\nAfghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV): The Administration objects to the lack of authorization in section 1216 for additional visas for the Afghan SIV program, which would enable Afghan nationals who have aided U.S. efforts through their work, and who experience an ongoing serious threat as a result, to apply for these visas. Additional numbers will be necessary to issue visas to all qualified applicants under current law. Further, the Administration strongly objects to the proposed dramatic cut back in section 1216 of the scope of eligibility for Afghans who have worked for the U.S. Government other than supporting its military forces. By narrowing eligibility, the program would erode the expectations of hundreds of Afghan staff whose lives remain in danger because of their work for the U.S. mission and also make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified Afghan staff who are essential to achieving our diplomatic and assistance goals.\nInnovation and Access to Non-Traditional Suppliers: The Administration objects to the authorization reduction and flexibility limitations in section 217 on programs that seek to broaden DOD's access to innovative companies and technologies. Specifically, the Administration is concerned with the complete elimination of the investment funding associated with the Defense Innovation Unit Experiment, as well as the reduction in funding for the Strategic Capabilities Office and In-Q-Tel's efforts to explore innovative technologies that enable the efficient incorporation into weapons systems and operations capabilities. While relatively modest compared to the Department's overall budget, these investments will enable the development of leading-edge, primarily asymmetric capabilities and help spur development of new ways of warfighting to counter advanced adversaries. In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that, when integrated with military systems and novel concept of operations, will be a source of battlefield advantage.\nProviding Footwear to Recruits at Initial Entry Training: The Administration objects to section 808, which would require the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to provide athletic footwear directly to recruits upon their entry into the Armed Forces instead of providing a cash allowance for the purchase of such footwear, at the choice of the recruit. Because it is likely that only one company could benefit disproportionately from such DOD purchasing requirements, this provision essentially serves as preferential arrangement for a particular company. Mandating that a specific article of clothing be provided to new recruits is unprecedented and, in the case of athletic shoes, runs counter to research that indicates a strong correlation between the variety of athletic shoes available, fit, and comfort, and reduced injury rates. Forcing DOD into a \"one size fits all\" approach to athletic footwear may contribute to a higher incidence of injury to new recruits during one of the most critical times in a member's military training. DOD places the health of our service members above all other considerations.\nProhibition on Per Diem Allowance Reductions Based on the Duration of Temporary Duty Assignment or Civilian Travel: The Administration objects to section 603, which would prohibit a reduced flat per diem rate for uniformed service members and DOD civilian employees who travel to one location for more than 30 days. This prohibition, which applies only to the Department, is contrary to the growing Government-wide trend toward implementing flat rate per diem for long-term travel. Section 603 would nullify an evidence-based policy decision that compensates DOD travelers for the expenses incurred, demonstrates the Department's stewardship of taxpayer funds, and meets external mandates to simplify travel and reduce costs. The significant increased costs would negate annual programmed savings affecting force readiness and reduce the Department's ability to fully fund official travel by imposing an unfunded annual requirement on the military departments. The prohibition would add $56 million or more annually to the Department's travel costs.\nClarification of Contracts Covered by Airlift Service Provision: The Administration objects to section 1085, which would expand the definition of a \"contract for airlift service\" to include any DOD contract in which \"transportation services are used in the performance of the contract or any subcontract (at any tier).\" Section 9516 of title 10, United States Code, requires DOD contracts for airlift services involving transportation by aircraft eligible for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program to be awarded to air carriers in the program. Section 1085 would significantly expand the range of contracts to which section 9516 applies and affect hundreds, if not thousands, of DOD contracts for supplies and services in which the use of air transportation is incidental to the performance of the contract or subcontracts at every tier. This provision would provide little benefit to DOD, restrict the Department's operational flexibility, significantly increase costs to the taxpayer, and place impractical and unnecessary constraints on DOD contracts.\nPlans on Transfer of Acquisition and Funding Authority of Certain Weather Missions to National Reconnaissance Office (NRO): The Administration objects to section 1609, which would transfer acquisition and funding authority for some environmental monitoring missions from the Air Force to the NRO. The DOD weather enterprise should be managed as an integrated mission. The Air Force currently provides space-based environmental monitoring systems, services, and data products to support a large number of strategic and tactical users. Section 1609 would make integrated sensor collection, mission management, data processing, and forecasting less efficient by segregating overlapping requirements across multiple organizations. Managing the DOD weather enterprise as a whole is the most affordable and effective way to meet warfighter requirements within available resources. There is currently no Air Force investment funding for a cloud characterization and theater weather imagery system or capability that could be transferred to the NRO.\nHypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle Defense: While appreciating the Committee's support to ensure defense against hypersonic boost glide vehicles, the Administration objects to section 1657, which would direct the Director of the MDA to establish a program of record. This provision could limit the Administration's ability to establish the best Service or Agency to establish a program of record to defend against hypersonic boost glide vehicles.\nEstablishment of Unified Combatant Command for Cyber Operations: The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for DOD's cyber mission and forces, but objects to statutorily requiring the establishment of a unified combatant command for cyber operations in section 911. The Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should retain the flexibility to recommend to the President changes to the unified command plan that they believe would most effectively organize the military to address an ever-evolving threat environment.\nRestructuring of the Distributed Common Ground System of the Army (DCGS-A): The Administration objects to section 219, which would restrict the development and integration of DCGS-A Increment 2 components where a commercial software is capable of fulfilling at least 80 percent of the component's requirement. This provision is duplicative and unnecessary and mandates a commercial solution without regard for price, ability to support a modular open system architecture, or cost associated with proprietary software maintenance. In practice, the provision could mandate acquisition of a system comprised of commercial products that do not fully meet required Key Performance Parameters without due consideration of integration costs and schedule impacts, putting the system's affordability, functionality, and interoperability at risk.\nConsolidation of Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Functions of the Air Force: The Administration objects to section 1646, which would require the Air Force to consolidate NC3 under a single commander and include the Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) system as a part of NC3. The Administration objects to the inclusion of ITW/AA within NC3 because it would fracture the space and missile-warning enterprise and adversely affect critical missile-warning and air defense operations. Furthermore, the consolidation would violate Commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) authorities for executing NORAD's aerospace warning mission and, thus, would require revision of the U.S. bi-national agreement with Canada. Also, the Air Force has already made significant progress towards consolidating the mission under a single commander (Commander of Air Force Global Strike Command).\nJoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF): While the Administration appreciates the Committee expanding the authority to interdict improvised explosive device precursor chemicals in foreign countries of concern, section 1532 fails to address the successor fund to the JIEDDF mandated by the NDAA for FY 2016. Without the authorization of the JIEDDF, the successor fund proposed by DOD, the Administration is constrained in its ability to rapidly respond to non-traditional, unanticipated improvised threats on the battlefield and to protect against the rapidly emerging improvised threats currently faced by U.S. forces.\nReduction in General Officer and Flag Officer Grades and Positions: While the Administration supports simplifying and improving command and control of the military, particularly where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy or less efficient, it objects to section 910, which would limit the grade of service or functional component commanders of combatant commands to be no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral, and reduce the total number of officers serving in the grade of general or admiral by five. The Administration intends to reduce the number of four-star positions and across-the-board mandated reductions are unnecessary.\nRestriction on the Application of the Prohibition on Performance of Non-Defense Audits by Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA): The Administration strongly objects to section 840, which provides a limited roll-back of the prohibition on performance of non-defense audits by DCAA. The Administration recommends simply rescinding the prohibition on performance of non-defense audits contained in section 893 of the FY 2016 NDAA. Maintaining the current prohibition on performance of non-defense agencies by DCAA extends the length of time it would take DCAA to reduce its incurred cost backlog and creates additional burdens and audit inefficiencies on the audit process for both contractors and Government agencies. The requirement in the Committee report for a comprehensive review by the Comptroller General of the United States of DCAA's current backlog is a more appropriate vehicle to identify potential remedies to address DCAA's incurred cost backlog.\nDual Status Military Technicians: The Administration objects to section 514, which would exempt dual status military technicians from civilian employee furloughs. Military technicians are civilian employees and should be treated in the same manner as all Federal civilian employees. As civilian employees, there are civilian furlough exemptions allowed by statute that would permit certain technicians to continue working. In addition, in the event of an emergency, these personnel could be activated, at which point they would convert to military status and would no longer be subject to furlough.\nUnobligated Balances Reductions: The Administration objects to the $2 billion reduction for unobligated balances across multiple appropriations. For Operation and Maintenance appropriations, $1.1 billion of the reductions will only be applied to those programs funded in section 4301, which include the military services' readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items. These reductions will delay the Department's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at the services' depot facilities. As part of the budget analysis, the Department reviewed the services' unobligated balances and realigned savings from historically underperforming accounts into readiness and operations accounts for FY 2017. The remaining $200 million reduction for Operation and Maintenance unobligated balances will affect Army Operation and Maintenance programs funded in section 4302, which include contingency operations and reset. This reduction will delay the Department's efforts to support ongoing overseas contingency operations and reset for equipment returning from theater.\nNational Biodefense Strategy: The Administration strongly objects to section 1086 which would require the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture to jointly develop a biodefense strategy and an associated implementation plan. The Executive Branch already works under several existing Presidential Policy Directives covering biodefense and these make section 1086 redundant. Additionally, biodefense is a cross agency national security priority that needs to be coordinated by the EOP. As such, the National Security Council staff is currently working with all relevant departments and agencies to develop, coordinate, implement and review biodefense efforts. Implementing a new structure and process outside of the normal Executive Branch coordinating mechanism will lead to confusion, and may slow or reverse the strong progress the agencies have made in developing robust biodefense programs.\nJoint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF): The Administration objects to the elimination of its base funding JUONF request of $99.3 million. This funding is vital to the Department's ability to quickly begin responding to urgent operational needs. Eliminating this funding may increase life-threatening risks to service members and contribute to critical mission failures.\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Reform: The Administration appreciates that the bill adopts a number of the UCMJ reforms proposed by the Administration, including enhanced victims' rights (including anti-retaliatory measures), improvements to trial procedures, and updated sentencing guidelines.\nHousing Unaccompanied Children: The Administration strongly objects to section 2812, which would prohibit the use of a military installation located in the United States to house any unaccompanied child. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is required by law to provide for the shelter, care, and placement of unaccompanied children referred to its custody. The number of children referred to ORR custody is difficult to predict and fluctuates throughout the year. As a result, ORR continually works to identify shelter options in the event of caseload increases, including space to temporarily house children when standard capacity is exceeded. These additional shelter options may include, but are not limited to, DOD facilities. DOD assists with the identification of those sites to ensure that such use would not adversely impact DOD operations. In addition, ORR reimburses DOD for the temporary use of DOD facilities and children are not cared for by DOD personnel. Given the unpredictability of flows in unaccompanied children arrivals, limiting the available shelter options would present serious difficulties for ORR contingency planning and would likely increase costs to U.S. taxpayers.\nPersonnel Provisions: The Administration has concerns with section 1109, which would limit the period of time for which an employee of the Federal Government may be put on administrative leave. The provision substantially limits Federal agencies' discretion, would be administratively burdensome, and, in many cases, would not allow time for the agency to thoroughly investigate and adjudicate issues in a legally defensible manner due to many factors. Section 1109 could also pose safety and national security issues, as it would restrain an agency's use of administrative leave in conjunction with a proposed adverse action and where an agency believes the employee may otherwise pose a threat to safety and security in the workplace, or to the proper safeguarding of sensitive information or operations. Further, for IC agencies, the requirement for notice to Congressional committees other than their authorizing committees could create unacceptable counterintelligence or security risks. The Administration also has concerns with section 1110, which would require an agency head to make a permanent personnel file notation for an individual who resigns while under investigation if an adverse finding is made. This section would be difficult to implement because it is unclear what would be expected of an agency under these circumstances since they are often precluded from taking any disciplinary action against individuals who are no longer employed by the agency. While section 1110 would provide for a process for notification and appeals, the process in and of itself would not correct the inherent flaw of placing a notation in an individual's official personnel file based on what may be an incomplete investigation, and without a full determination by the agency that an adverse personnel action would have been warranted.\nSmall Business Set-Aside Threshold: The Administration strongly opposes section 1804, which would synchronize the dollar amount of the statutory small business set-aside threshold in the Small Business Act to the level of the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT). The Administration seeks to increase the SAT from its current level of $150,000 to $500,000 in order to make transacting with the Government easier and less costly for contractors, including many enterprising small businesses offering emerging technologies that can be used to fight cyber-attacks and support forward-leaning twenty-first century digital activities. Despite the important benefits associated with raising the SAT, a parallel increase in the set-aside threshold could, by significantly reducing the value of procurements accessible to them, create friction with our trade agreement partners, who could seek to retaliate by reducing the ability of U.S. small businesses from competing for Government procurement contracts in their markets. Small businesses already receive a significant portion of Federal contract work between $150,000 and $500,000 and do not require imposition of the statutory set-aside in order to effectively compete for and receive work from the Government under $500,000.\nExemptions to Civil Rights Laws: The Administration strongly objects to section 1094, which would undermine important protections put in place by the President to ensure that Federal contractors and subcontractors do not engage in discriminatory employment practices. This Administration is committed to promoting equal employment opportunities for all Americans regardless of who they are or who they love while at the same time preserving longstanding safeguards in the law for religious liberty, including the religious exemption codified in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In authorizing certain Federal awardees to discriminate in Government-funded jobs, section 1094 represents a step in the wrong direction for our country that will keep qualified American workers from being able to hold jobs funded by the American people.\nSupply of Specialty Motors from Certain Manufacturers: The Administration objects to section 346 because this provision would erode energy and consumer cost savings from the final rule that amended the energy conservation standards for electric motors, undermine the Department of Energy's consensus agreement that involved a wide range of stakeholders in the rulemaking process, and exploit the loopholes that exist in the current regulations by allowing small businesses not to comply. This provision could harm domestic businesses and further complicate the market as cheap imports could also exploit this proposal.\nImpairment of Endangered Species Act (ESA) Conservation and Public Land Management: The Administration strongly objects to sections 2864 and 2865, which undermine State and Federal cooperative efforts to protect the Greater Sage Grouse and Lesser Prairie Chicken, as well as Section 2866, which removes the American Burying Beetle from the Endangered Species List. Section 2864 would effectively override longstanding principles of major Federal land management statutes, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the National Forest Management Act. Congressionally-mandated removal from the Endangered Species List, delays in determining species status, and State control over Federal public lands undermine the science-based decision-making at the core of the ESA, are unnecessary for military readiness, and are ill-advised for purposes of public land management. These provisions are non-germane to the NDAA, would impair the protection afforded by the ESA, and undermine years of collaborative conservation work with private landowners, States, and other stakeholders.\nThe National Historic Preservation Act: The Administration objects to section 2855, which would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to allow Federal agencies to object to a designation of Federal properties for reasons of national security. Listing a property on the National Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not limit any Federal agency's decision-making authority. Decisions on how to manage the property, informed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the agency with jurisdiction over that property. The Administration is not aware of any specific instance where such a designation has adversely affected national security. Enactment of this section could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired programs that Congress intended to help recognize and protect our shared heritage.\nMilitary Land Withdrawals: The Administration has concerns with sections 2841 and 2842 relating to military land withdrawals. With regard to the provisions applicable to public lands, the responsible agencies will continue to coordinate to facilitate responsible use of public lands to support military readiness, training, and testing, acknowledging the current system of periodic legislative re-withdrawals is not particularly efficient and does not provide for the optimum land management regime. However, the Administration is not prepared to support transfers of such lands without a process that provides careful consideration of the evolving needs, interests, and any supporting legislative provisions. The Administration stands ready to consider measures and approaches to make the use of public lands for military needs more efficient. The Administration cannot support provisions that would alter the current use and management structure of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and strongly opposes provisions that could allow unrestricted Air Force activities in areas of the Refuge. The Administration also recommends adoption of its proposal to standardize various land withdrawal termination dates, a measure that was replaced by the current section 2841.\nUtah Test and Training Range: While the Administration supports the appropriate and responsible use of public lands for military purposes, the Administration opposes provisions in Title XXX that would prevent the effective management of Federal lands, including those proposed for temporary use and closure. Further the Administration strongly objects to exchanges of Federal land in Utah without adequate consideration to the Federal taxpayer or NEPA contained in section 3023 and to section 3031, which would recognize the existence and validity of unsubstantiated and disputed claims of road rights-of-way across Federal lands in Utah. These sections are not necessary to further the military mission of the Utah Test and Training Range.\nBallast Water: The Administration objects to Title XXXVI, which undermines the ability to fight the spread of invasive species in our Nation's waters because it, in part: would lack critical civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms present in the existing statutory and regulatory regime, the absence of which would irreparably hinder the successful prosecution of unlawful discharges; would effectively discard the existing body of domestic environmental laws as those laws apply to vessel discharges; would jettison well-established statutory and regulatory regimes that implement U.S. international legal obligations; and would fail to preserve expressly the authorities of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to exercise administrative control over waters under each Secretary's jurisdiction.\nMaritime Administration/U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Restrictions: The Administration opposes sections 3507 and 3508. Section 3507 would preclude many qualified candidates with experience in managing higher learning institutions from applying for the position of Superintendent or Commandant and would interfere in the operation of an institution of higher learning which could adversely impact its accreditation. Section 3508 would eliminate MARAD's ability to use sales proceeds from National Defense Reserve Fleet non-retention vessels, leaving MARAD without funding to manage its 7,000 maritime heritage assets, many of which are on loan to maritime museums and other organizations throughout the country.\nRemoval of Commissioned Officers: Section 503 would amend 10 U.S.C. § 1161 to authorize the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to remove commissioned officers in certain enumerated circumstances. Commissioned officers are appointed either by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate (10 U.S.C. § 531(a)(2)) or by the President alone (10 U.S.C. § 531(a)(1)). Authorizing a subordinate official other than the President to remove an officer whom the President has appointed raises constitutional concerns under the Appointments and Take Care Clauses. The Administration would be happy to provide technical assistance to the Congress in achieving the aims of section 503 through other constitutional means.\nSenior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) Programs at Schools That Display the Confederate Battle Flag: Section 567 would prohibit the Secretaries of military departments from establishing, maintaining, or supporting an ROTC program at any educational institution that displays the Confederate battle flag anywhere on campus other than in a museum exhibit. The Administration strongly supports the removal of the Confederate battle flag—a divisive symbol and reminder of systematic oppression and racial subjugation—from the Nation's universities and other institutions. Cutting off Federal funding for a ROTC program on the ground that an institution displays the flag, however, raises First Amendment concerns. The Administration therefore urges Congress to pursue this important objective through other means.\nOther Constitutional Concerns: In addition, certain other provisions in this bill raise constitutional concerns, including interference with the President's exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations (section 1236) and to engage in the conduct of diplomacy (section 1234).\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.", "timestamp": "2016-05-16", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4909 – National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017"}

Bernie Sanders' campaign spokesman on Monday said Hillary Clinton should stop trying to distort the truth about Sanders' support for legislation to help carmakers and auto workers.\nCampaigning in Kentucky before Tuesday's primary election, Clinton repeated her false claim that Sanders did not vote to fund an auto industry aid package in 2008. In fact, Sanders voted for a $14 billion aid package which passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 10, 2008. When that bill ran into a Senate Republican roadblock, the White House turned to a separate Wall Street bailout fund for loans to the auto industry.\n\"It is absolutely untrue to say that Sen. Sanders voted against helping the automobile industry and auto workers,\" said Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs. \"Secretary Clinton first made this false claim before the Michigan primary. She now is recycling the erroneous charge in Kentucky. Once again, Secretary Clinton is simply not telling the truth.\"\nWhen Clinton first mischaracterized Sanders' position before Michigan's March 8 primary, The Washington Post said Clinton was trying to deceive voters and that she \"glosses over a lot . . . including the fact that Sanders is actually on the record as supporting the auto bailout.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117594", "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday said that the Federal Reserve must use its emergency authority to facilitate an orderly restructuring of Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt in a way that protects the island's people from Wall Street \"vulture funds\" trying to profit off the territory's financial crisis.\n\"What vulture funds on Wall Street are demanding is that Puerto Rico fire teachers, close schools, cut pensions and abolish the minimum wage so that they can reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the children and the people of Puerto Rico,\" Sanders said at a town meeting here. \"We cannot allow that to happen,\" Sanders added. \"We will not allow that to happen.\"   There is a humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico that Congress and the Administration must address as soon as possible. The people of Puerto Rico are experiencing enormous economic pain as a result of a depression that has now lasted more than a decade.\nReeling from a decade-long economic depression, Puerto Rico has lost 20 percent of its jobs since 2006. About 60 percent of all adults are either unemployed or have stopped looking for work. The childhood poverty rate has shot up to 56 percent.\nWall Street investors - who bought bonds at a deep discount which yield steep interest rates of up to 34 percent - have pressured Puerto Rico's government to adopt stern austerity measures. Over the last five years, for example, more than 150 public schools have been closed.

It is time for the Federal Reserve to act.Bernie Sanders\nSanders said creditors must work with Puerto Rico to develop a fair debt repayment plan to help the island's economy recover and give the territory time to expand its tax base, create jobs and reduce the poverty rate.\nHe also said the Federal Reserve should provide emergency loans to Puerto Rico to facilitate an orderly restructuring of its debt.\nThe senator renewed his opposition to a proposal by U.S. House Republicans to create an undemocratic control board in Washington to oversee the territory's budget and spending.\nIn order to create jobs, Sanders has introduced legislation to invest $1 trillion over five years to rebuild the nation's crumbling roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that would support 13 million good-paying jobs in the United States and put 150,000 people to work in Puerto Rico.\nHe also proposed an aggressive push to replace an energy system almost entirely reliant on fossil fuels and turn instead to clean energy sources like wind and solar power would help the economy and the environment.\nSanders also called on President Obama to release Oscar Lopez Rivera, a political prisoner that has already served 34 years in prison for his commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico. \"I say to President Obama: let him out,\" Sanders said. \"Free Oscar Lopez Rivera. He has done his time. And if you do not do this, I will. Oscar Lopez Rivera's incarceration violates the principles of justice, democracy and respect for human rights.

Summer is a critical time for young people to get access to first jobs that can provide important skills, experiences and networks for their future. At the same time, summer opportunities have been shown to divert youth from criminal involvement and reduce overall violence in communities. That is why, in February, the White House launched the Summer Opportunity Project to increase the number of young Americans participating in evidence-based summer opportunity programs, decrease the percentage of youth experiencing violence over the summer, and—more broadly—make sure that young Americans have the support they need to get their first job. This work builds on the President's My Brother's Keeper Task Force recommendation strengthening the case for summer youth employment and launching a cross-sector campaign to reduce summer learning loss and increase the number of job and internship opportunities for all young people.\nToday, the White House and the Department of Labor are announcing new steps to advance that effort including the release of $21 million in Summer Jobs and Beyond grants to 11 communities to connect disadvantaged young people with jobs this summer and year-round. The White House is also launching 16 Summer Impact Hubs--communities that will receive robust, coordinated support from 16 federal agencies to expand and refine their summer jobs, learning, including exposure to local innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities, meals, and violence reduction programs.\nThese announcements are aimed at supporting a range of state and local leaders, community-based organizations, private sector leaders, philanthropic leaders, schools, other youth-serving agencies, and young people that are all coming together at the local level to ensure that our youth have productive, healthy summers that enhance their educational and career prospects.\nKey Elements of Today's Announcements include:\n•      $21 million in Grants to Connect Young Americans to Jobs in the summer and Year-Round. The Department of Labor is announcing that 11 communities across the country will receive a total of $21 million to launch and expand innovative approaches that provide young people with summer and year-round jobs and connect them to long-term career pathways.\n•      Launch of 16 Summer Impact Hubs. The White House is announcing an inter-agency effort to provide tailored support to 16 communities to enhance jobs, learning, meals, and violence reduction programs for young people this summer and year-round and to ensure that these programs are well coordinated. Each Hub is paired with a Federal \"Summer Ambassador\" who will spend the spring and summer partnering with them to meet their locally-driven goals by leveraging Federal resources, breaking down agency siloes, and building new local, regional, and national partnerships.\nMore Details on Today's Announcements\n$21 million Summer Jobs and Beyond Grant Winners\nToday, the Department of Labor is announcing 11 winners of Summer Jobs and Beyond Grants, which will provide summer and year?round part?time job opportunities for In School Youth and employment and work experience opportunities throughout the year for young people who are out of school and work, in addition to exposure to career pathways in in?demand job sectors. Grants will focus on building out innovative strategies to help young people transition from summer jobs into year-round work and career pathways. Winning grant projects are summarized below.\n•      Utica, NY: The New Americans Career Pathways project will provide in-school youth with summer jobs and academic support for 400 students in the refugee populations of Utica, NY. The students will receive summer job work experience and academic tutoring in English and Math, and support in finding part- time jobs.\n•      Portland, OR: The Pathways to Sector Employment for Youth project in the City of Portland and Multnomah and Washington Counties will provide on-ramps to industry sectors for in-school and out-of-school youth resulting in entry-level jobs along career pathways in health care, IT, manufacturing and infrastructure. All students will take a course in four targeted industry sectors and participate in a paid summer work experience.\n•      Tribal counties in California, Illinois and Iowa: The Summer Youth Career Pathways Project will provide employment-related services to eligible Native American youth with limited work experience. The project aims to increase career readiness via online training courses that include digital skills, financial education, soft skills, career pathways, and workforce essentials. CIMC will work with thirty partners, including workforce agencies, human service agencies, local education agencies, employers, and community-based organizations.\n•      Milwaukee, WI: The Milwaukee Career Plus project aims to connect in-school and out-of-school youth to career readiness, summer employment, continued education, career services and year-round employment opportunities. Program staff will be placed in high schools to connect directly with students, and a partnership with Milwaukee Public Schools will help to identify non-attenders as soon as possible and engage them in support.\n•      Hartford, CT: The Promise Zone YES! project aims to transform and align youth-serving systems and enhance development services for 275 youth. Capital Workforce Partners will partner with the City of Hartford, Hartford Public Schools, Connecticut State Colleges & Universities, and two employers.\n•      Chicago, IL: Beyond Summer Jobs program will prepare youth and connect them to permanent, unsubsidized employment. The project will serve 300 youth including 240 who are out of school. Youth will begin the program in a summer job and then will participate in an extended paid work experience at one of ten employer partners.\n•      Santa Maria, CA: Santa Maria Summer Jobs & Beyond will serve 260 young adults by working with six partners to provide services while creating paid work experience opportunities, including summer and year-round employment that lead to skill building and postsecondary education pathways with coordination through the County of Santa Barbara Workforce Development Board.\n•      Detroit, MI: Grow Detroit's Young Talent program will create summer employment and year-round work experiences for 1,000 disconnected youth and underserved populations, including Latino and Arab-American youth. The Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation will create a one-stop reengagement center for youth that will: provide case management, career planning and referral services; offer work experiences in high-demand industry sectors among other activities.\n•      Franklin Hampshire Region, MA: Franklin Hampshire Summer Jobs and Beyond project will target three of the most high-need and least-served communities in the western Massachusetts region with intensive outreach and services to youth. One-hundred-eighty in-school youth with little to no work experience will receive intensive services, including job placement and college readiness.\n•      Indianapolis, IN: Youth Works Indy program will enhance existing summer youth employment programs and expand work readiness skills training and work experiences for participants in high-poverty, high-crime Indianapolis neighborhoods. Youth Works Indy expects to enroll 834 youth, and place 364 in unsubsidized employment and 182 in post-secondary employment. Indianapolis Private Industry Council, Inc. will partner with 5 summer employment programs, 4 local education agencies, 3 re-engagement centers, and 49 allied employers.\n•      Philadelphia, PA: PA CareerLink® Philadelphia: Youth & Young Adult Opportunity Hub (YOH/theHub) project will leverage partnerships with employers, universities, youth serving community organizations, and others to implement a multifaceted approach to providing youth with work experience opportunities that include summer and year-round part-time opportunities for in-school youth and exposure to in-demand job experience for out-of-school youth. The Hub will target 250 youth ages 16-24 in the Philadelphia area.\nLaunch of 16 New Summer Impact Hubs\nOver the last seven years, the Administration has been working to transform the Federal government into a more effective partner for local communities. Federal government leaders are working hand in hand with local stakeholders to craft solutions that harness resources across multiple agencies in response to local needs and priorities. Since 2009, more than fifteen Federal agencies have launched dozens of initiatives and partnerships with over 1,800 rural, tribal and urban communities. From Fresno to Detroit, Southeast Kentucky to Baltimore, Federal leaders are working across agency lines and offering hands-on support to build local capacity, provide expertise, and unlock resources to help community leaders achieve their goals.\nBuilding on that work, the White House and 16 federal agencies announce an effort today to provide tailored support from the Federal government to 16 Summer Impact Hubs to upgrade and expand their summer jobs, learning, meals, and violence reduction programs for young people this summer and year-round. These communities have each been paired with a Federal \"Summer Ambassador\" who will spend the spring and summer partnering with them to meet their locally-driven goals by leveraging existing Federal resources, breaking down agency siloes, and building new local and national partnerships. The Administration is also enlisting the targeted support of companies and philanthropy to create more opportunities for young people in these communities.\nFederal agencies will support these efforts. For example, the Department of Agriculture is providing nutritious meals; the Department of Education is offering technical assistance though its Summer Opportunity iForums webinars; the Department of Treasury is offering information on financial education and account access; the Department of Health and Human Services will provide guidance on how cities can use Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to support youth employment; the Department of Housing and Urban Development is enlisting the help of its network of 3,000 Public Housing Authorities to secure employment opportunities for more than 1,000 youth this summer.\nIn February, the President called on state and local leaders, community organizations, schools, and businesses to step up to connect young people to their first jobs and summer learning, meal, and violence reduction programs. If you would like to get involved in supporting a Summer Impact Hub click here.\nThis summer, the Administration will announce progress toward meeting the local Summer Impact Hub goals and organizations that have stepped up to support them at block parties across the country. These events will engage youth, families, businesses, local innovators and entrepreneurs, and community leaders around making this summer active, healthy, safe and productive.\nSummer Impact Hubs\n1.

The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the reading of the medal citations.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117479", "text": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the White House. Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for your words and your leadership. We've got a couple of Members of Congress here: Frederica Wilson and Chris Collins we want to acknowledge. And I also want to recognize Director Comey, members of the Fraternal Order of Police, and all the outstanding law enforcement officials who are here from around the country. I'm proud to stand with you as we celebrate Police Week. And most of all, I'm proud to be with the heroes on the front row and with the families who have supported them and the family of one who made the ultimate sacrifice.\nIt's been said that perfect valor is doing without witnesses what you would do if the whole world were watching. The public safety officers we recognize today with the Medal of Valor found courage not in search of recognition, they did it instinctively. This is an award that none of them sought. And if they could go back in time, I suspect they'd prefer none of this had happened.\nAs one of today's honorees said about his actions, \"I could have very well gone my whole career and not dealt with this situation and been very happy with that.\" If they had their way, none of them would have to be here, and so we're grateful that they are, and our entire Nation expresses its profound gratitude. More important, we're so grateful that they were there: some on duty, others off duty, all rising above and beyond the call of duty. All saving the lives of people they didn't know.\nThat distinction—that these 13 officers of valor saved the lives of strangers—is the first of several qualities that they share. But their bravery—if it had not been for their bravery, we likely would have lost a lot of people: mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends and loved ones. Thankfully, they are still with their families today because these officers were where they needed to be most at a critical time: at a gas station during a routine patrol, in the middle of a busy hospital, in a grocery store, on the campus of a community college, near an elementary school where a sheriff's deputy's own children were students and his wife taught. In all of these places, in each of these moments, these officers were true to their oaths.\nTo a person, each of these honorees acted without regard for their own safety. They stood up to dangerous individuals brandishing assault rifles, handguns, and knives. One officer sustained multiple stab wounds while fighting off an assailant. Another endured first-degree burns to his arms and face while pulling an unconscious driver from a burning car on a freeway.\nEach of them will tell you, very humbly, the same thing: They were just doing their jobs. They were doing what they had to do, what they were trained to do, like on any other day. The officer who suffered those terrible burns, he left urgent care and went straight to work. He had to finish his shift. And that sense of duty and purpose is what these Americans embody.\nAnd the truth is, it's because of your courage—sometimes seen, but sometimes unseen—that the rest of us can go about living our lives like it's any other day: going to work, going to school, spending time with our families, getting home safely. We so appreciate our public safety officers around the country, from our rookie cadets to our role model of an Attorney General. Not everyone will wear the medal that we give today, but every day, so many of our public safety officers wear a badge of honor.\nThe men and women who run toward danger remind us with your courage and humility what the highest form of citizenship looks like. When you see students and commuters and shoppers at risk, you don't see these civilians as strangers. You see them as part of your own family, your own community. As Scripture teaches us, you love your neighbor as yourself, and you put others' safety before your own. In your proud example of public service, you remind us that loving our country means loving one another.\nToday we also want to acknowledge the profound sacrifices made by your families. And I had the chance to meet some of them and they were all clearly so proud of you, but we're very proud of them. We know that you wait up late and you're worried and you're counting down the minutes until your loved one walks through the door, safe, after a long shift. We know it never gets easier, and we thank you for that. And of course, we honor those who didn't come home, including one hero we honor posthumously today: Sergeant Robert Wilson III.\nHe gave his life when two men opened fire at a video game store where Sergeant Wilson was buying a son a birthday present. To his family who's here—his grandmother Constance, his brother and sister—please know how deeply sorry we are for your loss, how grateful we are for Sergeant Wilson's service.\nWe also honor the more than 35 who have given their lives in the line of duty so far this year. One of them, an officer in Virginia named Ashley Marie Guindon, was taken from us on her very first shift.\nI've seen this sacrifice when I've joined some of you at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial not far from here. We read the names carved on these walls, and we grieve with the families who carry the fallen in their hearts forever. We've been moved deeply by their anguish, but also by their pride in the lives their loved ones lived. And in those moments, we're reminded of our enduring obligation as citizens that they sacrificed so much for: that we do right by them and their families.\nAnd medals and ceremonies like today are important, but these aren't enough to convey the true depth of our gratitude. Our words will be hollow if they're not matched by deeds. So our Nation has a responsibility to support those who serve and protect us and keep our streets safe. We can show our respect by listening to you and learning from you, giving you the resources that you need to do the jobs. That's the mission of our police Task Force, which brought together local law enforcement, civil rights and faith leaders, and community members to open dialogue and build trust and find concrete solutions that make your jobs safer. Our country needs that right now.\nWe're going to keep pushing Congress to move forward [in; White House correction.] a bipartisan way to make our criminal justice system fairer and smarter and more cost-effective and enhance public safety and ensure the men and women in this room have the ability to enforce the law and keep their communities safe.\nA few minutes ago, I signed into law a package of bills to protect and honor our law enforcement officers, including one that will help State and local departments buy more bulletproof vests. Emerson once said, \"There is always safety in valor.\" The public safety officers we honor today give those words new meaning, for it's your courage and quick thinking that gave us our safety.\nSo we want to thank you for your service. And we want to thank your families for your sacrifice. I had a chance before I came out here to meet with the recipients, and I told them that, although this particular moment for which you are being honored is remarkable, we also know that every day you go out there, you've got a tough job. And we could not be prouder of not only moments like the ones we recognize here today, but just the day-to-day grind: you doing your jobs professionally, you doing your jobs with character. We want you to know we could not be prouder of you, and we couldn't be prouder of your families for all the contributions that you make.\nSo may God bless you and your families. May God bless our fallen heroes. May God bless the United States of America.\nAnd it's now my honor to award these medals as the citations are read.\n[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Richard I. Lawlor, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Cmdr. Jillian C. Malzone, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President.]\nLet's give one last big round of applause to the recipients of the Medal of Valor.\nThank you all. Thank you for your dedication. Thanks for your service. You are continuously in our thoughts and prayers, and we are continuously giving thanks for all that you and your families do.\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-05-16", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117429", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:11 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the dry White House Briefing Room. (Laughter.) I do not have any announcements to start, so we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, do you want to go first?\nQ: Thank you. The Senate passed legislation today by voice vote that will allow families of 9/11 victims to sue in U.S. court for any role the Saudi government may have played in the attack. Does the White House threat to veto that bill still stand?\nMR. EARNEST: Darlene, I know that the advocates of this legislation have suggested that they have taken into account our concerns by more narrowly tailoring the legislation. But, unfortunately, their efforts were not sufficient to prevent the longer-term, unintended consequences that we are concerned about. This legislation would change longstanding international law regarding sovereign immunity. And the President of the United States continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make the United States vulnerable in other court systems around the world.\nThere's also a concern that hasn't gotten as much attention about the potential vulnerability that is created for some of our allies and partners in U.S. courts. And the concern is related to the fact that sovereign immunity is a principle that is critical to our national security. The United States is more engaged in activities in other countries than any other country in the world. Typically, those are actually activities that other countries benefit from significantly. These are peacekeeping activities, or humanitarian relief activities, or other activities in which the United States is supporting the national security activities of other countries, and the national security of other countries is enhanced by the involvement of the United States.\nBut out involvement in those activities is made more complicated by the chance that the principle of sovereign immunity could be eroded. So the administration strongly continues to oppose this legislation. And we're obviously going to begin conversations with the House about it.\nQ: Are the serious concerns that you just cited -- are those strong enough to lead to a veto of the bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, as I think I mentioned before, given the concerns that we have expressed, it's difficult to imagine the President signing this legislation. That continues to be true.\nQ: Will the White House -- as the bill goes to the House, will the White House work with lawmakers in the House to maybe keep the bill from coming up for a vote there? Is it important enough to try to do that and stop it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a variety of options. That would certainly be one of them. I think the other option would be seeking additional changes to the bill that would more directly address the concerns that we have been raising for months now. So there are multiple options, but we certainly anticipate having conversations with members of Congress about this issue.\nI would just note that there are both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives that have expressed concerns with the bill. So there is an opportunity for us to work in bipartisan fashion to try to address the serious concerns that we've raised about the unintended consequences of this legislation being enacted.\nQ: Just to before we came out -- concerning the veto theme -- the Statement of Administration Policy that was released on the $622 million Zika funding bill in the House -- saying that -- would recommend that the President veto that if it got to him. The Senate today is voting on three different Zika funding measures. There's one for about $1.1 billion that seems most likely to advance. Where does the White House fall on that particular bill? If the $622 million is not enough.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have several concerns with the House bill. The first concern is that it is woefully insufficient given the significant risk that is posed by Zika. That's not just my own personal analysis -- that actually is the analysis of our public health professionals who advise the administration about what should be included in the supplemental appropriations package that we sent up to Congress nearly three months ago.\nSo it's disappointing that Congress is -- at least the House of Representatives is three months late and more than a billion dollars short of doing what's necessary to protect the American people. There's no reason that this should be a partisan or ideological issue -- this isn't a question of government philosophy. This is a question about whether or not you're actually committed to ensuring that we're doing everything possible to protect pregnant women and babies in the United States of America from getting a debilitating disease, or at least a virus that has debilitating consequences for the neurological development of babies.\nSo we're quite disappointed that the House is so late in acting and what they've put together is so woefully insufficient. It's not just our public health professionals who have expressed those concerns. I would note that one certain Republican senator from Florida was on the floor of the United States Senate today expressing those concerns. So I do think it does raise a question for the 17 Republican House members from the state of Florida about what their view is. The Republican senator from the state of Florida has indicated that the Congress should act expeditiously to pass the $1.9 billion funding proposal that our public health experts say is needed.\nI think it would be interesting to understand exactly what position the 17 other Republicans from Florida who represent that state in the Congress think of this. I think it's certainly a relevant question. I think it underscores the point that I was making before that there's no reason this should be a partisan issue. This is a basic matter of the public health and well-being of the American people.\nQ: And the $1.1 billion -- where does the administration fall on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Senate, fortunately, appears to be making more progress. They will also include a vote today on the $1.9 billion proposal that we put forward back in February. And we strongly encourage Democrats and Republicans to come together around that bill. That's what our public health professionals say is needed to do everything possible to protect the American people from Zika. And this would be an emergency appropriation that would be available to state and local officials, and federal government scientists immediately. We believe that is the preferred -- we believe that's the best way to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nQ: You seem to be saying the $1.9 billion or nothing. I mean --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I'm saying is that is what our public health professionals say that we need. So we're looking for Congress to act on that request and that's what we would like to see move forward.\nThe other concern that we have with the House bill isn't just that the amount of resources committed is much smaller; the funding would be offset by taking away resources that are currently being used to protect the American people from Ebola. And traditionally, when Congress has been faced with a public health emergency, they haven't wasted a lot of time looking for funding offsets. And that's a pretty dangerous exercise because it delays the needed funding, but it also risks gutting other critical priorities.\nLet's talk a little bit about how that Ebola funding is currently being used. Right now, that funding is being used by the CDC to work with the health ministries in both Guinea and Liberia to investigate the rapidly changing situation related to new Ebola cases there. Right now, the CDC is assisting those governments in tracing nearly a thousand contacts. These are individuals who are at heightened risk of potentially spreading Ebola. So the CDC has 100 staff that are deployed over there, and that staff is helping to process 10,000 samples per month in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.\nSo it's pretty clear that what's happening -- that the work that the CDC is doing in West Africa was very helpful in the fall of 2014 in stopping the spread of that terrible disease, but it requires vigilance. And the lesson that we should have learned from 2014 is that the United States and the American people benefit from enhanced capacity of public health officials in other countries, that stopping the spread of a dangerous virus in another country makes the American people safer. And when that was an academic hypothetical exercise, there was some skepticism that some people expressed about that notion. But there weren't many people expressing skepticism about that notion in the fall of 2014 when there was concern about the Ebola virus appearing in the United States.\nSo it is a bad idea for Republicans to move forward with a proposal that would gut our efforts to follow through in the fight against Ebola and it's a bad idea for Republicans to further delay the emergency funding that's necessary to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nTim.\nQ: In Baghdad, several bombings today, extending the deadliest wave of the year in bombings there. And on Saturday, Prime Minister Abadi said that he's afraid that the political crisis there is hampering the fight against Islamic State. Does the administration share that concern?\nMR. EARNEST: Tim, let me start by saying that the United States strongly condemns the barbaric terrorist attacks in Iraq today by ISIL that specifically targeted innocent civilians. We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and their families. These string of attacks by ISIL is the latest reminder of the danger that this group poses to all Iraqis and the importance of Iraqi leaders from all communities, working together against a common enemy.\nTim, you'll recall back in 2014, the President made the offer of U.S. military assistance to Iraq contingent upon Iraq's central government more effectively uniting that country to confront ISIL. So that should be an indication to you that a unified, effectively governed Iraq is critical to our success against ISIL. It has been a central part of our strategy from the very first day. And we've been encouraged over the last year and a half by the efforts that Prime Minister Abadi has undertaken to unify that country and pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that can inspire the confidence of Iraq's diverse population that the central government in Baghdad is looking out for their best interests. We believe that that will have a corresponding impact on the effectiveness and resilience of Iraq's security forces.\nI think that's largely proved to be true. Iraq's security forces, backed by coalition military airpower and the advice and assistance of coalition militaries from around the world, has bene effective in driving ISIL out of territory that they previously controlled. We know that ISIL has been driven out of about 40 percent of the populated areas that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq. That's tangible progress.\nAnd our coalition is committed to trying to keep up that momentum and continue to pressure ISIL while also providing the Iraqi central government necessary resources to rebuild those areas that ISIL had taken over. We know that in places like Ramadi. ISIL didn't just occupy that community -- they essentially destroyed it. And rebuilding that infrastructure and rebuilding those communities so that people feel confident in moving back home is going to be critical to our longer-term success of bringing some stability to that region of the world. And so the important financial contributions that have been made by countries around the world are also an important part of our strategy, but they're all predicated on the Iraqi people and the international community having confidence in the effectiveness of the Iraqi central government.\nQ: Well, Abadi seems to be very concerned about the turmoil in his own government. Are you saying that the troops that are coming in, the U.S. troops that are coming in are going to help him deal with that while he figures out the turmoil?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think the U.S. troops that are in Iraq are there for a very specific reason, which is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And they're focused on missions that involve protecting the embassy, carrying out military air operations against ISIL targets, in some cases providing training and advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces, and there's a small number of special operators that have been organized into these expeditionary forces that can carry out raids against senior ISIL figures. We've been very clear about the mission that U.S. forces in Iraq are pursuing.\nQ: And on Syria, there's a lot of pessimism over the talks in Vienna. Does the White House believe that the Syrian government has systematically denied humanitarian aid?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's extensive reporting and plenty of evidence to indicate that too often the Assad regime or forces that are operating under the command and control of the Assad regime are making a concerted effort to prevent the kind of humanitarian access that's needed for Syrian populations that are caught in the crossfire of that conflict.\nAnd we've expressed our concerns on a variety of occasions about the tendency of Assad regime forces to either prevent convoys of humanitarian goods from moving into needed areas -- in some cases, there actually are reports of Syrian forces essentially raiding those convoys for the supplies that they would like to have or at least prevent those supplies from reaching the intended audience. So that is a source of significant concern. And one of the reasons that the administration has worked aggressively to hold the Assad regime accountable for living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities is to make it easier for those kinds of humanitarian supplies to get to those areas that badly need it.\nSo access for humanitarian relief workers and for humanitarian assistance continues to be a critical concern not just of the United States but the rest of the international community. And that includes the Assad regime following through on the commitment that they've made to abide by the cessation of hostilities and create conditions where it's much easier for humanitarian aid workers to get access to communities that have spent years caught in the crossfire.\nJustin.\nQ: Vice President Biden, tomorrow, is going to announce the final overtime rule, and the news here is that it's pegged now to the 40th percentile in sort of the lowest-paid region of the country rather than the country overall. It's about a $3,000 dip. I'm wondering if you can explain why the administration ultimately decided not to extend this benefit to more workers.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, the Department of Labor has been considering this change to overtime rules for quite some time, and their focus has been on making sure that people are fairly paid, including for their hard work. And by definition, this is a rule that would apply to the hardest-working Americans.\nBut this is a rule that continues to be under consideration and is in the process. It has been for some time, and I would expect an announcement about a decision soon, but I don't have any information about the conclusions that have been reached at this point. Once they've made an announcement, then we can engage in a discussion about why they've reached the decision that they have.\nQ: Senator Warren wrote a letter to the administration earlier this month and urged you guys that, one, too often the voices of workers are buried beneath a flood of comments from lobbyists and lawyers. If there an erosion here that would leave hundreds of thousands of people without getting that benefit, wouldn't that be a sign that lobbyists and lawyers ended up winning out with the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think there is a strong track record of this administration making sure that the rulemaking process represents the best interests of middle-class families. And that is true when it comes to establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that was established specifically to look out for the interests consumers that aren't as well represented in Washington and in the rulemaking process as much larger financial institutions that can afford highly paid lobbyists.\nSo whether it's the implementation of rules related to Wall Street reform, or the implementation of rules related to health care reform, or the implementation of rules related to fighting carbon pollution, the administration's track record of protecting the interest of middle-class families is rock-solid.\nQ: On the 9/11 bill, obviously it's got to pass through the House, but Senator Schumer said today that he believes -- that he would vote to override the President's veto and he thinks that he could have the votes to do that. Is that a legitimate concern? Are you guys going to start whipping against a veto override in the Senate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, before we get to the question of a veto override there's a question about whether or not this legislation will pass the House. So as I noted to Darlene, there are Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives that have raised concerns about the bill in the same way that the administration has. So we'll engage in a conversation with the House of Representatives, and we'll take it from there.\nQ: Last one, on Gitmo. You guys released a veto threat against the NDAA yesterday, and in it you said specifically that the restrictions preventing you from coming up with an alternative site for Guantanamo Bay was potentially unconstitutional. That's also the reason that you cited, back a few months ago when presenting the plan to Congress, for why you couldn't say which site would be picked -- your hands were tied because of this restriction. So if you believe it's unconstitutional, I guess the question is, why not either defy the law and let the courts decide, or challenge the law in the courts to allow you to do this work that you say is necessary for the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, we have made clear that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a top priority, and it's a top priority because taxpayer funds could be much more effectively spent in housing those individuals in facilities that have already been built here in the United States. And we could do that -- and in doing so, we could save millions of dollars in taxpayers funds. We've also expressed a concern that is shared by national security experts in both parties that extremist organizations use the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool. And the President believes that the American people would be safer if we took that recruiting tool, that propaganda tool away from extremist organizations.\nThis is all important, particularly when you consider that we've demonstrated in this country that we can effectively detain convicted terrorists on American soil in a way that doesn't pose an enhanced security threat to the American people. We've also demonstrated that we can bring terrorists to justice on American soil, using the American criminal justice system to hold them accountable for their crimes. That would give the United States the benefit of being able to say we're going to protect the American people and we're going to do it in a way that's entirely consistent with our values even if our adversaries and our enemies aren't willing to subscribe to those values.\nIt's a pretty powerful argument and a pretty powerful statement, and something that makes the American people safer. So that's our motivation.\nAnd, frankly, what we would like to see, Justin, is we'd just like to see Congress get out of the way. In some ways, it's not even a situation -- so often -- let's take Zika, for example. To fight Zika and protect the American people from Zika we need Congress's affirmative cooperation to do that. And right now, Republicans, particularly in the House of Representatives, are falling down on the job and putting the American people at greater risk because they aren't working effectively with the administration to fight the Zika virus, because they won't appropriate the emergency funding.\nWhen it comes to Gitmo, the standard is much lower. We just need Congress to get out of the way. They have, time and time again, included all these restrictions that have prevented the administration from doing what is necessary to protect the American people. So we just need Congress to remove those obstacles so that we can move forward effectively in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and doing it in a way that will enhance the national security of the American people.\nQ: But I think my question was if you believe the restriction is unconstitutional, and for all the reasons that you just outlined, strongly believe that the prison should be closed, why not either mount a legal challenge or just defy what you see is an unconstitutional restriction?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to our legal strategy. I think the most direct route is not one that winds through the federal courts for years, but rather --\nQ: Well, we're in year eight, right, so, you might as well try something, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I actually think that that's sort of my point, which is we are in year eight, so initiating a years-long legal process is certainly an option that's available to the administration. I'm not going to take it off the table. But given the priority that the President has established here, we'd like to just see Congress take the steps that are necessary to remove those obstacles so that we can get this important business done. That's the most direct route to accomplishing a national security goal that has been advocated by both Democrats and Republicans, including Republican President George W. Bush.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Staying on Gitmo for a second. The NDAA has a section that would appear to reopen the door to detainees there now to take plea deals in Article 3 courts and then be transferred to third countries. Is that something that you guys support? And by how much do you think that would reduce the population?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I haven't considered every single proposal in the NDAA, so let me consult with our policy staff in terms of the way that proposal is written and get back to you with a position on it.\nQ: And then on the talks about Syria, John Kerry today said if Assad \"has reached a conclusion that there is no plan B. He has done so without any foundation whatsoever and it's very dangerous.\" It's dangerous for whom?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the concern that Secretary Kerry is expressing there is that the longer that President Assad remains in power in Syria, the more chaos and violence and division plagues that country. And that's why the United States and most of the rest of the international community is strongly in favor of executing a political transition inside of Syria as soon as possible. He has lost the legitimacy to lead that country, he continues to order the Syrian military to carry out attacks against innocent, unarmed civilians, and by doing so, he has lost any claim within the realm of reason to being able to govern the country of Syria. Just as a practical matter, it's hard to imagine that Syrian citizens who are on the receiving end of barrel bombs would at all be open to President Assad continuing to lead the country.\nSo the longer that he is there, the more dangerous and violent that country becomes. And that's dangerous for the United States because we know that extremist organizations like ISIL -- and they're not the only one -- try to capitalize on that chaos and that violence to establish a safe haven and plot and carry out attacks against targets outside of Syria, including areas -- including locations that are important to the United States and including on the soil of close American allies.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, on the NDAA, the Statement of Administration Policy objects to a provision in the bill that would undermine President Obama's federal -- executive order prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination among federal contractors. Would that provision alone be enough for the President to veto the House version of the NDAA?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, the way that it's detailed in the Statement of Administration Position that you've clearly reviewed quite closely, there's a long list of concerns that we have with the proposal that Republicans have put forward. So at this point, I don't think I can single out any one as being sufficient to garner a presidential veto, and the reason for that is just that there are a whole lot of reasons why the bill is bad and why the President strongly opposes it.\nSo I think what I can say as a general matter is that the President has been forceful in using his executive authority to prevent discrimination and the executive order that you've cited is a good example of that. And the President has on a number of occasions protected his ability to use that executive authority in his negotiations with Congress. Because we know that there are some in Congress who, for reasons that seem rather perverse to me, believe that the President shouldn't be taking actions to prevent discrimination. So I'll leave it to them to explain why that's an appropriate position for them to take. It's one that seems hard -- difficult to justify, in my opinion. But the President has worked hard to protect his executive authority that can be used to prevent discrimination, and that's something that we take quite seriously.\nQ: How confident are you that the Republican-controlled Congress will present the President a version of a defense authorization bill that will omit this provision against his executive order?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's very difficult to predict exactly what this Congress will do. But what is true is that there are a long list of reasons why we have strong concerns about the way that the NDA legislation is currently written, and we're hopeful that Republicans will begin to make some changes.\nAfter all, this is their responsibility. Republicans have a strong majority in the House of Representatives. Republicans have a strong majority in the United States Senate. So, ultimately, it's Republicans who need to carry the weight of figuring out how to ensure that our national security professionals and our men and women in uniform have the authority and funding that they need to protect the country.\nSo this is a basic function of the United States Congress. It's unfortunate that it is being larded up with a bunch of proposals like the one that you just cited that aren't related to our national security but are intended to be divisive. And we hope that at some point Republicans in Congress will act responsibly to put forward a funding authorization proposal that is consistent with our national security interests.\nLesley.\nQ: Thanks, Josh, appreciate it. I wanted to ask you, going back to the directive on Friday, on the bathrooms, transgender bathrooms. There's an impression that the administration has been particularly aggressive on transgender issues, sort of more so than it was on gay marriage before the President's evolution in 2012. I'm just wondering if you see that reflecting society or if that's an administrative decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think I would describe our position that way for a variety of reasons. I think the first is, this is a confrontation that Republicans have sought out, rather cynically, because they are seeking a political advantage. So it's the Republicans in the North Carolina legislature, for example, that convened a one-day special session to ram through HB2, the now infamous HB2 in North Carolina so that it could be quickly passed in both houses of the legislature and then signed into law by the governor of that state. They have since walked back some aspects of that bill in the face of significant criticism, particularly from the business community, and it's clear that it's had a negative impact on the economic climate in North Carolina.\nSo the comments that we've seen from Republicans in other places I think makes clear that they're not really interested in helping schools across the country confront what is a difficult policy challenge; they'd rather just cynically try to appeal to people's fears in order to try and gin up political support for their campaigns.\nAnd that's not the approach that the administration is taking, and in fact, I think this was evident from the guidance that was issued by the Department of Education on Friday, that in response to specific requests from school administrators across the country, the Department of Education put forward best practices and good ideas with regard to how schools can implement this policy in a way that will protect the dignity and safety of every student at the school. And these weren't just ideas that were developed by administrators in Washington, D.C. -- these are actually ideas that were developed by school administrators across the country who had found workable solutions that could be successfully applied in their schools. And sharing those ideas with school administrators across the country is a tangible, constructive offer of assistance that I think the majority of school administrators appreciated.\nAnd that's not the kind of constructive contribution that we've seen from conservatives. From conservatives, you basically have seen the suggestion that they don't really have a way of -- they haven't really put forward a specific suggestion for how they believe that the rules should be applied. The best that they seem to have come up with is suggesting that birth certificates should be examined before anyone can enter a public bathroom. So that doesn't make sense. That certainly is an indication that they are much more interested in politics than they are in actually trying to solve the problem.\nQ: But you said that the directive was not necessarily brought about by the North Carolina law. So I'm wondering if the administration has made a concerted effort -- I mean, the Wall Street Journal calls it an effort to start a culture war to drive voter turnout in November -- I mean, if they've made a decision to sort of be more aggressive on these measures.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't make a habit of reading the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal I think for obvious reasons, but I did happen to take a look at it today, and I noticed that the editorial also noted that somehow Democrats appeared to be obsessed with sex, which I thought was a rather amusing observation on their part because it's Republicans who have, for example, passed this HB2 law in North Carolina. It's Republicans in the Congress that have created a special congressional committee to take a look at Planned Parenthood. It's Republicans who have sued the administration over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including as it relates to women being able to get access to their birth control. So it's a curious observation by the Wall Street Journal that I don't think stands up to a lot of scrutiny.\nQ: Getting back to the President, is he making more of a decision to be more forceful on these issues than he had been back in 2012 when he was criticized for being sort of slow on gay marriage?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think so. And again, I think that at every stage, it's this administration that fought for and successfully ended \"don't ask, don't tell.\" It's this administration that declined to continue defending the Defense of Marriage Act as litigation contesting that law wound its way through the courts.\nSo, again, I think as it relates to this issue, it is clear that it's Republicans who are seeking a political advantage and an administration that is seeking to offer tangible, practical advice to school administrators who are seeking to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On lifting sanctions on Burma, the Treasury Department announced today you're going to be lifting a variety of those sanctions tomorrow. But the President did say that the national emergency is going to continue and called Burma an extraordinary threat. So I wonder if you could tell us whether the President feels like the human rights situation in Myanmar warrants this action, and whether you might like to see some more progress on that front before additional sanctions come off.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's start by saying that the U.S. government announced steps to support Burma's new democratic government, including the recalibration of sanctions on Burma, to demonstrate support for the new government's democratic reforms and the broad-based economic development.\nThere's no denying the important political process that has been made in Burma, and the United States has been strongly supportive of the Burmese people and Burmese government as they pursue these reforms. One high-profile piece of evidence about that progress was the election that was conducted just in the last few months that allowed for the peaceful democratic transfer of power. It's an important development in that country's history and is indicative of the important progress that they're making in pursuing long overdue political reforms.\nAt the same time, the United States wants to continue to further incentivize democratic reforms and continue to pressure targeted individuals and entities, including the military, so that work of reforming that government continues. There obviously is more work that needs to be done, and the sanctions that remain in place do serve to pressure those entities that may be advocating for rolling back some of those reforms.\nSo the government has made important progress. We want them to build on that momentum. And that's why the recalibrated sanctions announcement will move forward. But there still are entities that are obstacles to needed reform and we continue to apply pressure against those entities so that we can hopefully nurture the continued progress that Burma has met.\nQ: But if you still think that there are concerns as it relates to human rights and the military's control and the government potentially rolling back the progress they've made, wouldn't it be wiser to wait until you see some more of that progress before you go lifting sanctions?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think that's why we've described it as recalibrating the sanctions rather than lifting them, because --\nQ: -- entities that you listed, though.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, for discussion of specific entities and what impact they may have had on political reforms, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department. They can sort of walk you through our policy towards specific entities. But most of the remaining sanctions are primarily intended to discourage economic activity with certain individuals and entities, particularly those who undermine or obstruct political reform in Burma, commit human rights abuses in Burma, or propagate military trade with North Korea.\nThose are the entities that are targeted. And I think for those reasons, continuing to apply those sanctions makes sense. At the same time, it's also important to recognize the progress that Burma has made, and by recalibrating the sanctions and easing the sanctions against some entities in Burma, we acknowledge the important progress that they've made and further incentivize additional reforms.\nSo that's the recalibration strategy that's been applied in this instance.\nMichelle.\nQ: Okay, so the White House has now issued several strongly worded warnings about the 9/11 bill to members of Congress. And you've come out publicly and said these exact same things before. But today, when this bill passed on a voice vote, there was no opposition. So doesn't that tell you that there's just as strong a feeling even from the President's own party that this is a legitimate concern, and that the needs of these families to at least bring their claims to a court are more important than some indeterminate risk that some other country could do something similar to the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the administration is strongly committed to assisting the 9/11 families, and there are a variety of ways in which this administration has gone to bat for 9/11 families and those who did such important work around Ground Zero to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. I have in mind, of course, the legislation that on a number of occasions got bottled up in the Congress to ensure that those who performed so heroically at Ground Zero were able to get access to health care.\nSo the administration's commitment to our nation's national security and to those who lost the most on 9/11 is steadfast. And our commitment to those principles will not change.\nBut we have to acknowledge the significant unintended consequences of moving forward with a piece of legislation like this. And this is a concern that's not just expressed by the Democratic administration; there are Republicans in Congress who have also expressed concerns about this in the past. So this is a sensitive issue, and I would acknowledge that the politics are tough. But focusing on the substance, we need to make sure that we don't overlook the potential unintended consequences of a bill that could put the United States at risk around the world. That is a dangerous proposition and one that the Commander-in-Chief I think is rightly concerned about.\nQ: So it just seems like Democrats in the Senate, by there being zero opposition on this bill, it seems like they're sending a message to the White House that the concerns of the White House aren't as important. What's your response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let them explain their position and I'll let them explain why they did not object to a proposal that has significant, though, admittedly, unintended consequences. But, look, the accusation here is not that somebody in Congress voting for this legislation is seeking to intentionally inflict harm against the United States. Our concern is that that is an unintended consequence of this particular piece of this legislation. And it's the responsibility of the President of the United States and the Commander-in-Chief to look out for the interests of the United States and our servicemembers and diplomats around the world.\nThe concern that we have is that other countries could use the passage of this bill as an excuse to initiate their own proceedings in their own courts that puts the United States uniquely at risk.\nQ: Are you disappointed that Democrats in the Senate didn't voice the same concerns or oppose this bill that the White House is --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, we oppose the bill, so we obviously are not pleased to see it move forward in the Senate. But we're going to engage with the bipartisan members in the House of Representatives who have expressed similar concerns and see if we can ensure that they are addressed as this legislative process moves forward.\nQ: In the past, you've urged members of Congress not to proceed because this could have ramifications. So the fact that it has now passed the Senate, are there ramifications to that alone in terms of the relationship with Saudi Arabia or anything else?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I think as we discussed when the President traveled to Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago, the President had a long bilateral meeting with the King of Saudi Arabia and the issue of this legislation was not raised. And I think it is an indication of the fact that right now, at least, this legislation is not interfering with our ability to coordinate with the Saudi Arabian government on a range of issues of mutual concern.\nBut our broader concern is about the potential, unintended consequence that the passage of this legislation would bring about, and that is basically giving other countries an excuse to subject the United States of America to what could just be kangaroo courts in other countries. And it puts the United States in a situation where we spend a lot of time and energy and resources going and defending the United States in foreign courts. That's not a good use of our time. It's also certainly not a good use of our diplomatic capital. These kinds of cases would just serve as an additional irritant in our relations with countries around the world.\nSo, again, we believe that these kinds of concerns are the kinds of concerns that should be taken into account by every member of Congress as they consider their position on this bill.\nQ: The families out a statement saying, well, the big difference here -- they're sort of dissecting the arguments that the White House has made, and they said, well, the difference here is that the U.S. doesn't support terrorist organizations that target civilians. So if this bill is so narrowly tailored to involve just terror attacks on U.S. soil, and you look at the argument that those families are making, is that really such a huge risk that somebody would do something similar? If you're just looking at that specific instance, of targeting civilians on our soil in this case? And obviously Democrats in the Senate don't agree that that risk is --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I do understand what you're saying. And, look, I think that the concern is about potential unintended consequences. There are a number of countries around the world that do falsely accuse the United States of engaging in acts of terrorism that result in the death of innocent civilians. There are other countries that publicly make that accusation on a regular basis, and if they now have a precedent for establishing their own method of bringing the United States into court and putting at risk U.S. assets that are held overseas, even as they prosecute those false claims in a kangaroo court, that's not a path that we want to go down.\nThe other concern, Michelle, is exactly how that system could work. You can imagine a scenario where somebody who's injured or wounded overseas is brought back to the United States for medical treatment and then they die. That could potentially open up the United States or other countries, including our allies, to claims in an American court because that individual died on American soil. And this is the thing. I mean, our court system is such that you don't have to be an American citizen in order to file suit in an American court. I recognize that these are hypotheticals, but they are potential, unintended consequences that are quite serious. And that's the basis of our concern about this bill. The potential, unintended consequences that have and could have a very negative effect on U.S. national security, could put at risk the United States, our assets, and our personnel in countries all around the world.\nRon.\nQ: So is this just a closed matter again, the whole issue of 9/11? Because obviously you're talking about unintended consequences, and the families are concerned about finally trying to figure out exactly what happened. And you've said before I think on Saudi Arabia that the investigation showed there was no Saudi connection, the 28 pages. Others have said that this is not significant information -- just like the furor about it. So do you say to the families essentially that -- oh, and also, you seem to say that there are some changes to the legislation that Congress didn't consider that might have made it more palatable to the administration. Is there some way to reconcile this whole concern about sovereign immunity and the families concern? Or is this really just the end of it as far as the administration is concerned?\nMR. EARNEST: It's certainly not the end of it. There's a lot to unpack there. Let's start by -- there was a commission, an outside -- a commission of experts established outside the government to examine the attacks of 9/11, to take a look at what conditions led up to the attacks, what exactly transpired on that fateful day, and what sort of reforms could be implemented to ensure something like that never happens again. It's that outside group, the 9/11 Commission, that carefully examined all of the available evidence and concluded that there's no evidence to indicate that the Saudi government as an institution supported the 9/11 plotters.\nSo that's not some sort of government conspiracy -- this is an outside organization, staffed by experts that took a close look at this. And those -- the leaders of that commission themselves reviewed the 28 pages. They have acknowledged that 28 pages included preliminary investigatory materials that they had an opportunity to pursue. And that as a result of reading those 28 pages, they conducted interviews -- not just in the United States but in other countries around the world to follow up on those potential leads.\nAnd despite having read those 28 pages and despite having acted on them by pursuing investigations that that information could point to, they still concluded that the Saudi government as an institution didn't support the 9/11 plotters. So I think there is no denying that that part of it has been exhaustively investigated. I'm not saying this to suggest that somehow that's going to ease the pain of somebody who lost a loved one or several loved ones on 9/11.\nOur heart breaks for those people. These are thousands of Americans who walk around every day with a hole in their heart because they lost a loved one on that tragic day. And trying to make sense of that and trying to move on with one's life is something that many of them have been challenged to do, and they've demonstrated tremendous patriotism and heroism as they've moved on with their lives.\nAnd in some cases, we're talking about parents who have had to raise kids on their own. In some cases, we're talking about first-responders who have continued to fight fires and respond to emergencies, even with the memory of their partner in the back of their mind. So there's no denying the heroism of the 9/11 families. And there is no denying the courage that they have shown every single day since 9/11.\nBut what we're focused on here -- and I think what the families are genuinely focused on as well -- is the national security of the United States and making sure that the United States of America continues to preserve the ability to protect our interests around the globe. They understand that our capacity to do that is critical to preventing terrorist attacks on American soil. So the President's priority is not different than the priority that's been identified by the 9/11 families when it comes to protecting the United States of America and protecting our men and women in uniform and our diplomats as they serve our country around the world.\nQ: So did I hear you correctly that there were some changes that could have made that could have reconciled this whole concern about sovereign immunity? Or did I -- in terms of the way these bills were written -- or is this just not a reconcilable situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the reason that we are going to talk to Democrats and Republicans in Congress is to figure out if there is a way to address the serious concerns that are raised by these potential, unintended consequences. I don't know if that's possible at this point, but we certainly are willing to engage in a bipartisan conversation to make that happen if it's possible.\nQ: On the TSA -- there's been a lot written lately about long lines at airports and people being really inconvenienced. I saw a study that said the morale in Homeland Security is the lowest in the federal government; there's high turnover. The summer season is coming up. And while that's an inconvenience to travelers and all that, how much of a security risk is there now? Is it greater? Is there a concern in the administration that because of this tension on the system, to put it mildly, that there is now a greater concern about security lapses, perhaps, at airports around the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you probably should talk to somebody at the TSA to draw a definitive conclusion about that. I think what I would just state is the significant challenge that TSA officers face, which is they don't want to inconvenience people. They know people are just trying to get on their flight and do their business or go home to see their family or go on vacation or whatever it is that they're doing. But they want to make sure that people can engage in that travel safely.\nAnd so there's always going to be a little tension in making sure that we're doing thorough checks and making sure that we are protecting the integrity of the aviation system while also at the same time giving people the freedom to use that aviation system without a whole lot of hassle and inconvenience. And resolving that tension is challenging, and there are a number of creative things that the TSA has tried to do -- the establishment of pre-check, which allows some individuals to go and essentially go through a background check that's conducted by the government so that they can go through an expedited security line. That's one example.\nWe know that the TSA has been working closely with airports to see if airports can actually commit to using airport personnel to expedite the process. So, Ron, as a reporter, you've had to travel through a lot of airports. It's not uncommon for TSA officers to help people navigate the screening process by loading materials into trays and getting into the right line. So that's not necessarily a core security function so what you could do is the TSA could coordinate with airport staff so that when lines get long or volumes are expected to be high, that it's airport personnel that don't have a security function that can help people manage the security process so that all of the security-trained people can be involved in the actual screening.\nSo my point is that there's always going to be a little tension here in the basic function of the TSA. And the TSA, to their credit, has worked hard to try to be creative about developing solutions that would make this process more efficient and not inconvenience travelers as greatly while also adhering to the high security standards that I think we all would demand.\nQ: Right, but, again, the long lines have revealed that there seems to be staffing problems. There's a high turnover rate; there's low morale. And the question is, to what extent is all of that potentially compromising safety at the airports? Is there a concern in the administration, has there been some focus in trying to make sure -- well, you do this on a daily basis -- but given where we are in the last month or so of this particular phenomenon of these long lines, has there been some targeted effort focused to make sure that this is not causing security problems, beyond the inconvenience?\nMR. EARNEST: Even in the face of these significant challenges, the professionals at the TSA are committed to the safety and security of the American traveling public. And they maintain these very high standards because they're concerned about safety, and you're right that this is something that they are reviewing safety standards and security standards regularly, daily, to ensure that those high standards are being met. And they're doing all that even though on average the TSA is now screening about 125,000 more passengers per day. And there has been an effort by the TSA to expedite the processing of the newest class of TSA officers. There has been an effort on the part of TSA to get Congress to approve funds that could be reallocated so that additional overtime pay can be paid to the TSA officers so that they can be paid for working longer hours and therefore try to shorten lines.\nSo, again, there's a lot of work that's going into trying to be creative about how to not inconvenience travelers unduly while also maintaining the strict safety and security standards that the American people would expect.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Has the President or the White House been tracking what's happening -- or what happened in Nevada at the Democratic State Convention there? Sanders supporters were reportedly making death threats against the state party chair to the point where the state party actually filed a complaint with the DNC. Does the White House have a reaction? And obviously there's a lot of emotion around this primary process still. Is it time for the President to sort of step in and calm the waters and help unify the party, moving into the final stage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as it relates to the delegate selection process for individual states, I would refer you to the DNC. They have a very well-established process whereby they review the plans that are put forward by individual states for choosing their delegates to the convention and every state does it differently, and that makes the process a little cumbersome but it's the way that each state retains control over the process for selecting delegates to the Democratic Convention.\nBut I think at the same time, you've heard the President on a number of occasions talk about how political disputes can never justify an act of violence. And the President talked about this in his speech at the Rutgers commencement ceremony just on Sunday, about the importance of good citizenship, about the importance of focusing on facts and evidence, and how the establishment of our political system was intended to resolve disputes among our citizens to prevent violence from occurring in the first place.\nAnd I think what is true is the expectation that the President has that there will be a strong commitment to that principle of nonviolence. And the way that candidates in both parties address this question publicly is important and I'm confident it's something that people all across the country will carefully watch.\nQ: Is the White House disturbed by the behavior of not only members of his own party making death threats against the state party chair over what is, essentially, as you characterized it, a political dispute?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't looked at the individual claims that have been made, but I think the President on a number of occasions has spoken out against violence and has certainly said that a political dispute like this can never be justified or used to justify an act of violence or even a threat of violence. And that is a principle that he has championed for a long time and his expectation would be that politicians in both parties, whether they're involved in an election or not, would express their support for that principle.\nQ: One more on the President's legacy on special interest. Roll Call yesterday reported that a Republican lobbyist is trying to organize other lobbyists on behalf of Hillary Clinton. She's had lobbyist bundlers. Donald Trump has hired some ex--foreign government lobbyists into his campaign. The President banned lobbyists from donating to his campaign and the DNC. No current 2016 campaign has embraced that pledge. Even Bernie Sanders sort of made this a key issue. Is the President worried that his legacy on this issue is being eroded?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I think the authenticity of the change that President Obama brought to Washington has been confirmed in what you just relayed. And it's an indication of how difficult it is to change our political system, particularly when it comes to confronting entrenched special interests and the President is quite proud of his record of doing that. And the truth is, it's going to be up to the next President to determine exactly how to build on that progress. And presumably there are a variety of ways to do that, and I think that will be part of the debate -- not just through the summer but also into the fall. But these principles of ensuring that citizens retain a voice in their government is something that the President has made a high priority.\nJohn.\nQ: Over the past week, you've had some pointed words from the podium about Republicans' use of this $100 billion figure in regard to the Iran nuclear deal. I've gone back and asked them about it, and they basically point to the administration's own use of it last summer, back in July, and a few instances from the Treasury Department, from Secretary Kerry, President Obama in an interview with The Atlantic. Where did the administration, when they were initially using that figure before the deal was finalized, where was that coming from?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, what I can tell you is that there were initial estimates about the amount of money that Iran had in reserves outside of their country that were subject to sanctions. And this is essentially money that Iran was not able to get access to because of the sanctions that we had put in place to compel them to come to the negotiating table. And those sanctions did have the effect of bringing Iran to the negotiating table and ultimately pressuring Iran to sign on the dotted line of an agreement that verifiably prevents them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. That was a genuine success.\nNow, what the Secretary of the Treasury and others repeatedly tried to explain is how much money Iran was likely to get access to -- that much of those funds that were held overseas were basically already spoken for in terms of debts that Iran had already sort of -- they had already incurred. And what critics of the deal have suggested is that Iran would get all that money and be flush with cash and then use it for terrorism. And we've said that the critics were vastly exaggerating that risk. That was the essence of the debate at the time is we were trying to explain exactly what would happen here. And they did vastly overstate that risk in a way that they continue to repeat. And they're wrong about it. Ted Cruz just wrote an op-ed in the New York Times repeating this claim. It's not uncommon to come across Republicans spouting off this false claim, and the truth is, what's happened is we actually see officials in Iran saying they didn't get nearly as much sanctions relief as they thought they would.\nAround the time of the negotiations, it was actually the Iran Central Bank Governor who came forward and said that they expected that Iran would get $30 billion in sanctions relief. And I think based on the tone and the comments from Iranian officials, they haven't even met them that far. So that's the essence of the way in which Republicans repeatedly misled the American public when talking about the Iran deal or just didn't know what they were talking about.\nSo it's not just as it relates to sanctions relief where what Republicans said didn't turn out to be true. Many of them, at the very beginning of this exercise, said that it didn't make sense for the United States and the international community to negotiate with Iran over their nuclear program because they'd never go along with the deal. They were wrong about that.\nAnd many of our critics have suggested that Iran would never make -- take the kind of actions that are consistent with rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program. But yet that's exactly what they did. They reduced their uranium stockpile by 98 percent. They rendered harmless their heavy water reactor. They disconnected thousands of centrifuges.\nAnd Republicans, critics of the deal suggested that the international community would never be able to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement. But, in fact, the nuclear experts at the IAEA -- an organization that's won the Nobel Peace Prize, I might point out -- has verified Iran's compliance with the agreement. So critics of the deal who predicted that we would never be able to verify that Iran was going along with the agreement are wrong, or at least on the wrong side of an argument with internationally renowned nuclear experts.\nSo the list of concerns that we have here with the way that Republicans have conducted this debate is lengthy and I can certainly understand why Republicans appear quite desperate to try to recapture what credibility they have left.\nQ: And despite that characterization, isn't it about the money being freed up for Iran to use their other resources towards other programs? I mean, it's the money that the sanctions relief is going towards, these debts that they've already incurred and paying those off, isn't that freeing up another pocket of money they could use? Isn't that kind of the Republicans' point that they've got access now to a broader fund? Or is your point just that they wouldn't have paid off those debts in the first place?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my point is that they weren't paying off those debts, and then when the money was freed, some of them have gone to doing exactly that. So there's no evidence that anybody can marshal that that's exactly -- Republicans cannot demonstrate that what they predicted came true. But I can certainly substantiate the fact, even in the claims made by Iranians themselves who are responsible for managing their economy, they've expressed concern about the fact that they haven't gotten as much sanctions relief as they expected to get. And they acknowledged a much lower level of sanctions relief than what Republicans said was likely to happen -- to say nothing of the many Republicans who I can point to who said that Iran was going to get $150 billion in sanctions relief, a number that was completely unsubstantiated. And then you've got somebody like Congressman Steve Scalise who said that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. So it appears he might have a little baggage when discussing the truth about the Iran deal.\nQ: So what's the bottom line? What's the total figure? You said it was far less than $100 billion, but has Treasury come up with an estimate? Or are you relying on what the Iranians have said publicly?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an assessment to share with you. You certainly can check with the Treasury Department and maybe they'll know.\nQ: And my final question was, Senators Cornyn, Barrasso, and Mark Kirk -- they wrote a letter to the President yesterday regarding Ben Rhodes, calling on the President to fire him. You said that the President stands by his Deputy National Security Advisor. What's your response to the letter? What's the President's response to the letter?\nMR. EARNEST: The publicity stunt that Senator Kirk attempted one week ago today -- I think pretty much everybody ignored it then, and I'm going to ignore it now.\nDave.\nQ: Josh, thanks. Back on the Zika bill in the House. The White House wasn't just saying that you don't want to offset the money from the Ebola fund, you're saying you don't want to offset the money for Zika from anywhere else in the budget. In a $4 trillion budget, why are you insisting that there be no offsets for this Zika relief?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is typically the way, Dave, that Congress has considered emergency appropriations, which is that they, recognizing the existence of an emergency, Congress has not gotten bogged down in political fights related to pay-fors. Demonstrating a sense of urgency, most Congresses, when confronted with a public health emergency, would consult with public health experts and consider carefully what sort of assistance should be provided and they would provide it. And that's what we believe that this Congress should do.\nQ: On the Ben Rhodes matter, obviously he didn't go to the hearing today to testify like the committee wanted. Can you explain why last week you said this has nothing to do with executive privilege and today Neil Eggleston said, oh, yes, it does have to do with --\nMR. EARNEST: No, he didn't. That word does not appear in the letter. And my good friends at the House Government Oversight Committee posted that letter on the website, so you can certainly check it out for yourself. But the White House counsel did not raise that prospect.\nQ: So why didn't he go?\nMR. EARNEST: Because there's longstanding concerns that we have expressed and that previous Presidents have expressed when it comes to declining a request to voluntarily testify based on institutional concerns. The President of the United States should be able to get confidential, candid advice from his top advisors. And this is a principle that basically every President has observed.\nI would note that at least one of the individuals who did testify before the House Oversight Committee today served in the previous administration and invoked exactly the same concern -- because he had almost exactly the same title as Mr. Rhodes -- in explaining why he wouldn't testify before Congress. So this is an indication that it's not a partisan matter, but rather a longstanding institutional difference of opinion between Congress and the executive branch.\nQ: Isn't that asserting executive privilege without saying the words?\nMR. EARNEST: No. Executive privilege applies specifically to situations when the President of the United States acts to protect information that is compelled by Congress. This was a specific request for testimony on a voluntary basis. So on one hand, you've got information that Congress is compelling; on the other hand, you've got testimony that was requested. So the principle is different. And that is evident in the letter, so I would encourage you to check it out.\nQ: If I could overstay my welcome for one more.\nMR. EARNEST: You're not overstaying your welcome.\nQ: The Senate Democrats tomorrow are going to hold what's called a hearing on Chief Judge Garland because there is no nomination hearing yet. Did the White House participate in arranging this in any way? Do you think it's a good idea? And isn't it a clear sign that the nomination just isn't going anywhere?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did hear that the Judiciary Committee is planning a hearing for tomorrow. And obviously the White House has been coordinating closely with Democrats and Republicans on the committee to try to move that process forward. But as it relates to the individuals who are testifying before the committee tomorrow, I'd refer you to the members of the committee to talk to you about it.\nQ: Is this a sign that things are just not going well, that this nomination is dead?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the fact is Chief Judge Garland has got another six meetings over the course of this week. He's met with 15 Republicans. He's submitted his questionnaire and members of the Judiciary Committee have posted that questionnaire publicly on their website. So we continue to apply pressure to Republicans. The President did an interview with BuzzFeed just yesterday, talking about why this is a critically important issue. And we're going to continue to raise pressure on Republicans. And all of the publically available data that I've seen indicates that it's not just Democrats and independents who are dissatisfied with the position that many Republican senators are taking, but many Republican voters across the country are expressing concern with the way that Republicans in the Senate are refusing to do their job.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was spotted leaving the White House. Can you tell us anything about why he was here?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll see if I can get you some more information about what he was doing while he was here. He obviously is somebody who has had an opportunity to interact with the President in the past. He participated in a forum with President Obama at the G20 in Malaysia where they talked about the global economy and the impact that climate change is having on the way that businesses, large and small, around the world are confronting climate change.\nBut I'll see if we can get you some more information about his visit.\nQ: Also if it relates in any way to our trip to Asia.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Also, going back to I guess it's technically called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act -- this passed Senate bill, it's not just about Saudi Arabia. It opens up I guess litigation against any other state, which is your concern about sovereign immunity there. From what -- you're saying from the podium, you've said focus on the substance, look at the facts. Are you saying that, in that sense, one of the most emotionally eroded living memories in American history is being used for political purposes and in some ways overshadowing the substance of a bill that you've described as perhaps potentially dangerous to American interests? I mean, are you going that far to say that this one issue is overshadowing all the other ways that this bill could become a problem for the U.S. or other countries?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's no denying the charged, emotional nature of this issue and why the discussion of this particular legislation could arouse particularly strong feelings. I'm not going to question the motive of the people who may be involved in supporting this bill. I'm just merely pointing out the source of the concerns that we've expressed.\nThis bill does potentially open up the United States to a range of unintended consequences that would be bad for our national security. It would be bad for our ability to continue to coordinate with our allies, make that even harder, and it could risk -- put at risk the United States, our assets, and maybe even our personnel in countries and courts all around the world.\nSo that's the source of our concern. This is a concern that we've repeatedly expressed. And that's the reason we oppose the bill. It's not because we question the motives of those who are involved in trying to promote the bill. Our concerns are substantive and relate specifically to the potential of unintended consequences.\nQ: And not specifically about Saudi Arabia, which is the only country we've discussed here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's because the advocates of the bill are suggesting that they want to create an opportunity that --\nQ: -- played it in some way that this is some sort of special treatment or that this is being treated differently because of Saudi Arabia, versus, say, the Supreme Court decision that was just recently upheld regarding suing Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, which the administration has supported. So can you explain the difference, I guess?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the difference is, is that there is this small class of countries that are confirmed state sponsors of terrorism that are in a separate category from every other country. And, yes, that includes Iran. We do know that Iran uses assets of the state to support terrorism around the world, including terrorism that has claimed the lives of American citizens.\nSo we do treat Iran differently from every other country. Iran and other countries that are confirmed state sponsors of terrorism are treated differently than every other country, including Saudi Arabia that's not.\nQ: So you don't see the position to be supportive of the Supreme Court upholding being able to sue Iran and a position opposing this bill because it could compromise sovereign immunity as contradictory in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: No, because there is this special exception that does apply to confirmed state sponsors of terrorism, and Iran is one of them.\nQ: Question for you on -- an amendment from Congressman Thornberry specifically trying to cap the number of NSC officials at 100. It's being suggested that power is too concentrated in the hands of too few located in this building and not other assets of national security establishment. Do you have any comment on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, a couple observations I guess. I think the first is the President's current National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, has actually undertaken an effort to try to streamline and reform certain functions of the National Security Council that have allowed her to reduce the size of the National Security Council by about I believe 10 percent or so. And I think that's the first thing.\nI think the second thing is there's no denying the wide array of significant national security challenges that any President of the United States confronts when they walk into the Oval Office every morning. And ensuring that that President has access to the expertise and advice that he needs to deal with those challenges is an important priority. And the desire of some Republicans to try to limit the ability of the next President to make foreign policy decisions may reflect their lack of confidence in their prospects for the next presidential election.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Maybe you covered this. I was out a couple days last week. But transgender Americans as it relates to White House facilities and other government facilities, be that the State Department, elsewhere -- they're able to use the restroom of their gender identity without restriction, and that's always been the way, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that it's always been that way, but it's certainly been that way in the Obama administration.\nQ: Okay. Is the President aware of the readiness issues as it relates to the United States military?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there certainly are a number of things that we believe that Congress has proposed to do that would have a direct impact on our military readiness. There are a whole range of programs that Congress repeatedly funds that our military leaders say that we don't need, and there are a whole set of national security priorities that our military leaders have said are worthy of an investment from Congress that have been underfunded by the United States Congress.\nSo there are a number of things that the President and our military leaders believe that we could do that would enhance our readiness, and there are a number of things that Congress shouldn't do that would degrade our readiness. And so there are concerns about the way that Congress handles its business with respect to the military.\nBut I can tell you that the President of the United States is quite proud of the finest fighting force that the world has ever known. He has often described his role as Commander-in-Chief and leading the men and women of the United States military as the greatest professional honor of his life. And I think, time and time again, we have seen the heroism and courage and professionalism of the United States military yield significant and enormous benefits to the American people. And that's true when it comes to fighting Ebola. That's true when it comes to rescuing hostages. And that's true when it comes to taking out terrorists. The President is quite proud to lead the United States military.\nQ: And yet he may veto the defense bill, despite the fact that there are a number of F18s that can't be launched right now, B1 bombers having trouble. I'm just wondering if the President feels like the services deserve more money. And if they deserve more money, what's he doing about it? He's going to veto this bill. It can make it even tougher for them to do the job and the missions that they've been charged with.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President is not vetoing the bill and suggesting that Congress shouldn't pass them any funding. The President is actually going to veto the bill because he believes that Congress should more effectively fund our national security apparatus, including our military, and that there are programs that are worthy of more funding, and more consistent funding.\nI believe that Secretary Carter has spoken to this repeatedly, that right now what Congress is proposing to do is to basically just fund the military for the next six months. That doesn't make any sense. That's not a smart way to manage the most effective fighting force in the world, particularly one that we depend on to protect our national security.\nSo this is an ill-advised piece of legislation. And there are a number of reasons that we oppose it. And the President --if this is passed, it's something that he will veto so that Congress can pass funding at an appropriate level for our United States military to protect our readiness and to protect our country.\nQ: So while you all squabble back and forth with congressional leaders, what's the message to the women and men who are charged with mission readiness and their job is to protect us all? They need their funding. They need their money.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, they do. I hope that Congress is hearing your message, Kevin.\nQ: Right. And so you guys have to figure this thing out. Because I get letters and emails from people who say, ask the White House, what are they doing about this? When are they going to put pen to paper and make sure that we're covered and that we're taken care of?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, it's the responsibility of the United States Congress to fund our government. That includes funding our military. And I'll remind that if people want to actually understand exactly what the President's proposal is, we put forward a budget back in February. And for the first time in 40 years, Republican leaders in Congress refuse to have a hearing to even discuss what the President's Budget Director exactly what our national security funding strategy should be. So it's Republicans who have fallen down on the job. It's Republicans who have refused time and time again to handle their responsibilities consistent with putting our national security first.\nThey'd much rather play politics and attack the President's EO to prevent discrimination against LGBT Americans, something that has nothing to do with funding our national security priorities, but, for some strange reason, is actually included as a provision in the NDAA bill. That's not a provision that was inserted by Democrats, that was a provision that was inserted by Republicans who are much more interested in playing politics than they are with funding our national security.\nQ: What's next? What's the solution to the issue? Because every day that goes by, there's another aircraft that can't be launched, there's another soldier out there that doesn't have what she or he needs.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and I think that is a very good question for the men and women in the United States Congress who have a responsibility to fund our government and to fund our military. That is a core function of the United States Congress. That is the way that our Founders designed our system of government. And the President has a responsibility to put forward a very specific proposal and he did that. And it's Republicans who refuse to even discuss it with him.\nSo Republicans are the ones that have to bear the responsibility of figuring out how they're going to use their majority in the House and the Senate that they fought so hard for to make sure they're doing right by our men and women in uniform.\nQ: Lastly, I'll take this one because I'm not sure if April can make her way back in. The Urban League's 40th State of Black America report is out. Is black America better now than it was when President Obama took office?\nMR. EARNEST: There is no denying -- and Mitch McConnell agrees with me on this -- that all of America is better since President Obama took office, and black America is better since President Obama took office. And no matter how -- on almost any measure that I can think of, whether it comes to graduate rates, access to health care, or the strength of our economy and job creation, by every measure, our economy and our country is stronger -- not just for African Americans but for all Americans.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Someone who does not have a political agenda or any partisan bones in his body I don't think spoke about the new regulations in the administration. This is Cardinal Robert Sarah, one of the Pope's right hands in the Vatican, speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast this morning. He said, and I quote, \"Should it be not that biological men should use a man's bathroom. It doesn't get any simpler than that.\" Does the administration have a reaction to criticism of its new orders from a top Vatican official?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen his comments.\nYes, ma'am, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. When the President --\nMR. EARNEST: She sat through the whole thing.\nQ: I had to run -- I'm dealing with Roots over there -- I wanted to ask you about that, too.\nMR. EARNEST: I understand. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you, Josh. When the President visits Japan for the G7 meeting next week, will the North Korean nuclear issue be discussed at this meeting? And also I have a second question for you. And what is it the United States final destination of North Korean nuclear issues? Does the President consider before his administration, the end of this year, will there be more attention to the North Korean nuclear issues?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm confident that this is an issue that will be discussed at the G7 meeting in Japan. Obviously the world is concerned about the provocations and destabilizing activities of the North Korean regime, and Japan is particularly concerned about the impact that those activities could have on their national security.\nThe United States believes strongly in our alliance with Japan. The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of regional security in Northeast Asia. And the United States has deployed resources and personnel to Japan to assist them in countering the threat that emanates from North Korea.\nAs it relates to resolving our broader concerns with North Korea's nuclear program, we continue to work with the international community to pressure the North Korean regime, to isolate them further and encourage them to come into compliance with their international obligations. Earlier this year, the United States worked effectively with China at the United Nations to ramp up the pressure that has been placed on the North Korean regime. We put in place sanctions that went farther than they ever have before in isolating that country and targeting certain industries in North Korea that we know generate revenue that's used to invest in their nuclear program.\nSo those kinds of sanctions would not be possible without the effective cooperation and coordination of the United States and China, and we're going to continue to work with the rest of the international community to make progress in isolating North Korea until they make clear that they're prepared to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and stop engaging in the kinds of provocative acts that are broadly destabilizing.\nQ: What is President Obama's final decision for the North Korean nuclear issues before he steps down?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the next step will be up to the North Koreans and it will be up to the North Koreans to decide whether or not they're ready to commit to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Until they do, they're going to continue to face the kind of isolation that they currently suffer from.\nGo ahead, April.\nQ: Thank you. I'm sorry. Please don't be angry. It's hard dealing with two events at one time. One, as you talked about the Urban League, they're talking about an issue -- ACA, focusing on ACA, and hoping that the costs will be cut for health care, the price -- the high prices of health care. What does this administration say in the midst of that report?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm glad that you asked that question because it does give me an opportunity to point to the recent study that was published that indicates for the first time the percentage of Americans with health insurance in 2015 exceeded 90 percent.\nThat's the highest annual measure that's ever been recorded and is another sign of the important progress that our country has made under the Affordable Care Act. One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act was to put downward pressure on the growth in health care costs. And since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, we have seen the slowest growth in health care costs on record. That, again, is another tangible sign of the important benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\nMoving forward, as the law continues to be implemented and as more people get access to health care and as more competition is created in individual markets, we're optimistic that we're going to continue to put downward pressure on costs and put outward pressure on expanding coverage to even more Americans.\nQ: And then on another subject, really fast. You have \"Roots\" in your next building -- the conversation and airing I guess of the film, parts of the film. Can you explain why this White House for \"Roots,\" this historic movie event that happened decades ago, and the re-airing of it in a new version now? And also, the most recent movie filming, the John Legend movie, the Underground movie. Can you talk to us why these events are happening here?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the significance is that this is obviously a film that shaped a generation of Americans views of our country's history and of race relations in this country. And there's been a movement to modernize the film and present an updated version that I think has a lot of people talking and a lot of people considering some issues that are central to the founding of our country. And they're central to our nation's history, and they're central to the impact that race relations has on everyday life in the United States. So these are issues that are worthy of discussion and study and using an opportunity with the presentation of a new film like this, the administration decided to try to capitalize on that opportunity to cultivate and engage in an important discussion.\nQ: So this is part of the President's effort to keep the dialogue going on race? These movies -- the airing of these movies from this historic place?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is an opportunity for people to come together and discuss these issues. And certainly people's interest in a film like this provides an appropriate venue for having those discussions.\nGo ahead, Mark.\nQ: I wasn't aware of this event. Was the President at this screening?\nMR. EARNEST: He is not. He is not.\nQ: One other question. You mentioned the 90 percent with health insurance. Why is it not 100 percent? What's holding up the ACA on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, part of what's holding it up are Republican governors across the country that are opposing the expansion of Medicaid. And it's unfortunate that we've seen -- that we continue to see millions of Americans be denied access to health care because Republicans in their state don't want to be viewed as implementing, let alone supporting, the health care reform law, championed by President Obama. So that's a -- there are millions of Americans who don't have access to health care for that reason. That certainly is a big chunk of that 10 percent that doesn't have access to health care.\nSome of them are -- some of those people are also individuals who have chosen to pay a penalty as opposed to paying for health insurance and we talked a lot last fall and even earlier this spring about why that was not a common-sense financial choice but yet it's a choice that some Americans make.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:48 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-05-17", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Rogers, R-KY)\nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on H.R. 4974, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, and services for men and women in our Armed Forces and their families. In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned, and provide the requested advanced appropriations. However, the bill does not fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and includes objectionable restrictions on performance awards for VA Senior Executive Service civil servants. In addition, the Administration strongly objects to the bill's unwarranted restrictions on the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, as these restrictions further impede the Executive Branch's efforts to responsibly close the facility.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nMilitary Construction. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Department of Defense's military construction and family housing requirements.\nDetainee Matters. The Administration strongly objects to section 512 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. This provision would constrain the flexibility that the Executive Branch needs to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests. The Administration also objects to section 136 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to carry out realignment of the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay. While this provision is intended to preserve U.S. control of the U.S. Naval Station, it may restrict the Administration's ability to relocate the functions and civilian personnel positions in support of the detainee mission.\nVeterans Affairs Funding. The Administration objects to the $1.5 billion reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request for VA, including a decrease of $1.2 billion from the request for Medical Care. This reduction would negatively impact veterans' access to medical care and reduce VA's ability to maintain medical facility infrastructure and activate new and replacement facilities with sufficient staff and equipment. In addition, the bill does not include the request for general transfer authority, which would provide VA needed funding flexibility to address high priority needs.\nVeterans Affairs Senior Executive Service (SES) Performance Award Restrictions. The Administration objects to section 237 of the bill, which would prohibit performance awards for VA SES civil servants. This provision would decrease morale among VA's workforce, disadvantage high-performing SES employees, and could prevent VA from attracting and retaining top talent committed to serving veterans.\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to implement the DATA Act. This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nConstitutional Concerns\nAdditional provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, section 113 of the bill may interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief, and sections 201, 202, 219, 225, 229, 230, 231, and language in title II under the headings \"Information Technology Systems\" and \"Construction, Major Projects\" raise separation of powers concerns.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-05-17", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4974 - Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017"}

Rogers, R-KY)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016. The Zika virus poses a serious public health threat. There is active, mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus in approximately 50 countries, including U.S. Territories. The Zika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and abroad, and there will likely be mosquito-borne transmission within the continental United States in the coming summer months. As of May 11, 2016, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and U.S. Territories, including over 110 pregnant women with confirmed cases of the Zika virus. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. In addition, researchers are investigating an association between the Zika virus and Guillain-Barrй syndrome, neurological disorders, and other adverse health outcomes.\nThe Administration is committed to taking necessary steps, as quickly as possible, to protect the American people from the Zika virus. In February, the Administration submitted to the Congress a request for $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding. In the absence of timely action from the Congress, the Administration redirected existing funds to scale up the urgent work necessary to address the Zika virus. However, the redirected funds can only temporarily address what is needed to support the full range of activities aimed at preventing, detecting, and responding to further transmission of the Zika virus to protect the American public.\nWhile the Administration appreciates that the Congress is finally taking action to address the Zika virus, the funding provided in H.R. 5243 is woefully inadequate to support the response our public health experts say is needed. Specifically, the Administration's full request of $1.9 billion is needed to: reduce the risk of the Zika virus, particularly in pregnant women, by better controlling the mosquitoes that spread Zika; develop new tools, including vaccines and better diagnostics to protect the Nation from the Zika virus; and conduct crucial research projects needed to better understand the impacts of the Zika virus on infants and children.\nIn addition, the Administration objects to the bill's use of previously-appropriated funding as an offset. Funding to fight the Zika virus should be treated as an emergency, the same as past public health emergencies such as the Ebola and H1N1 viruses, and should not be offset. Furthermore, rescinding additional funds previously designated for Ebola and other important initiatives such as critical infrastructure funding would harm the Nation's ability to address a range of urgent, emerging, and ongoing health challenges. Ebola remains a global health threat, as evidenced by recent cases in Guinea and Liberia, and Ebola funds must be replenished to keep the disease from threatening our shores again. The Administration also objects to the bill's limitation on funding only through the end of fiscal year 2016. The CDC expects the health effects of the Zika virus to last beyond September 30, 2016, at which point the Department of Health and Human Services would no longer have this funding for these activities and, given uncertainty around the disease, funding could run out even sooner. Like prior emergencies, the effort to protect the American people from the Zika virus should not be funded incrementally.\nThe Administration urges the Congress to provide full emergency supplemental funding at the level requested by the President. If the President were presented with H.R. 5243, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-05-17", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5243 - Zika Response Appropriations Act, 2016"}

The people of this country want a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent, super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors.\n\"The Democratic Party has a choice. It can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change - people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy.\n\"Within the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a 'penchant for violence.' That is nonsense. Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high-crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence. Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals. But, when we speak of violence, I should add here that months ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign office in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was broken into and ransacked.\n\"If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned.

Unfortunately, that was not the case at the Nevada convention. At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place. Among other things:\n* The chair of the convention announced that the convention rules passed on voice vote, when the vote was a clear no-vote. At the very least, the Chair should have allowed for a headcount.\n* The chair allowed its Credentials Committee to en mass rule that 64 delegates were ineligible without offering an opportunity for 58 of them to be heard. That decision enabled the Clinton campaign to end up with a 30-vote majority.\n* The chair refused to acknowledge any motions made from the floor or allow votes on them.\nThe chair refused to accept any petitions for amendments to the rules that were properly submitted.\n\"These are on top of failures at the precinct and county conventions including trying to depose and then threaten with arrest the Clark County convention credentials chair because she was operating too fairly.\"", "timestamp": "2016-05-17", "title": "Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Nevada"}

And it's one of the single most important steps we can take to help grow middle-class wages.\"— President Barack Obama, La Crosse, WI, July 2, 2015\nEvery week, millions of Americans work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive the overtime pay they have earned. Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will be finalizing a rule to fix that by updating overtime protections for workers. In total, the new rule is expected to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans who are not currently eligible under federal law, and it is expected to boost wages for workers by $12 billion over the next 10 years.\nFor much of the 20th century, the 40-hour workweek was a pillar of economic security for working families. The rules of the road were simple: if you were called on to put in extra work, your employer had to pay you extra regardless of whether you received an hourly wage or a salary. This left most Americans with more money in their pockets, more time to balance obligations at home and at work, and the opportunity to get ahead with more time outside of work for school or additional training.\nYet over the past 40 years, overtime protections eroded as a result of inflation and lobbyists' efforts to weaken them. The share of full-time workers qualifying for overtime based on their salaries has plummeted from 62 percent in 1975 to 7 percent today—even though the protections are more important than ever. Parents now have more demands on their time, with all parents working in more than six out of ten households with children. And despite a recent acceleration in wage growth and businesses adding 14.6 million jobs over a record 74 straight months of job growth, most Americans have seen relatively stagnant wages for the past few decades.\nThat's why tomorrow, the Department of Labor is finalizing a rule to update overtime protections so they can help millions more Americans. The final rule, which takes effect on December 1, 2016, doubles the salary threshold—from $23,660 to $47,476 per year—under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime (hourly workers are generally guaranteed overtime pay regardless of their earnings level). Additionally, this new level will be automatically updated every three years to ensure that workers continue to earn the pay they deserve.\nIncreasing overtime protections is another step in the President's effort to grow and strengthen the middle class by raising Americans' wages. This extra income will not only mean a better life for American families impacted by overtime protections, but will boost our economy across the board as these families spend their hard-earned wages.\nRESTORING OVERTIME PROTECTIONS\nIn March 2014, President Obama signed a memorandum directing the Department of Labor to modernize our nation's overtime rules, which have been comprehensively updated only once since the 1970s.\nOvertime protections were first put into place by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and established the general standard that workers be paid time-and-a-half for any hours worked over 40 hours in a week. In general, all hourly employees are guaranteed overtime, and salaried employees are presumed to have the same guarantee unless they both: (1) make more than a salary threshold set by the Department of Labor, and (2) pass a test demonstrating that they primarily perform executive, administrative, or professional duties. A limited number of occupations are not eligible for overtime pay (including teachers, doctors, and lawyers) or are subject to special provisions.\nTomorrow's rule takes into account input from 270,000 public comments and extensive outreach meetings with employers, business associations, small businesses, workers, worker advocates, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and state and local government representatives. It will:\n• Raise the salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, or from $455 to $913 a week. This doubles the current salary threshold while being responsive to public comments regarding regional variations in income by setting the salary threshold at the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowest income Census region (currently the South). Tying the salary threshold to the lowest-wage region of the country has strong historical precedent in previous rulemakings.\n• Raise Americans' wages by an estimated $12 billion over the next 10 years, with an average increase of $1.2 billion annually. At the same time, employers retain considerable flexibility in how they comply with the new rule, such as increasing salaries to at least the new threshold to keep positions that are primarily executive, administrative, or professional exempt from overtime pay; paying overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 in a week; or reducing overtime hours.\n• Extend overtime protections to 4.2 million additional workers who are not currently eligible for overtime under federal law. Others who may already be eligible for overtime will also benefit as the higher salary threshold will serve as a useful bright line test for workers—and their employers—to understand whether they are eligible for overtime. The number of workers in each state who will benefit from the rule can be found  HERE.\n• Update the salary threshold every three years. The updates will ensure the threshold is maintained at the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowest income region of the country. Based on projections of wage growth, the threshold is expected to rise to more than $51,000 with the first update on January 1, 2020.\n• Raise the \"highly compensated employee\" threshold - from $100,000 to $134,004 - above which only a minimal showing is needed to demonstrate an employee is not eligible for overtime. This upper threshold was designed to ease the burden on employers in identifying overtime eligible employees since it is more likely that workers earning above this high salary level perform the types of job duties that would exempt them from overtime requirements.\n• Respond to employers' concerns by making no changes to the \"duties test\" and allowing bonuses and incentive payments to count toward up to 10 percent of the new salary level. Workers earning more than the salary threshold are still subject to the duties test to determine eligibility for overtime. In their comments to the proposed rule, employers argued that changing the duties test would be difficult and costly to implement, and the final rule leaves the existing duties test in place. Additionally, for the first time, employers will be able to count bonuses and commissions toward as much as 10 percent of the salary threshold.\nThe Department of Labor will also release three technical guidance documents, designed to help private employers, non-profit employers, and institutions of higher education come into compliance with the new rule.", "timestamp": "2016-05-17", "title": "Fact Sheet: Growing Middle Class Paychecks and Helping Working Families Get Ahead By Expanding Overtime Pay"}

WILBON: Morning-ish. And thanks, everybody, for being here. Welcome to the feature panel of the Project Play Summit, where for the next we're told about 30 minutes, give or take, three kids from, generally speaking, the same patch of land on the South Side of Chicago will do more than reminisce. We will talk about the experience of growing up there and participating in all manners of play -- parenting at a time when participation has become so complex -- and all three of us are that -- and also the necessity of increasing as much as we can participation, regardless of stature or income or bearing.\nAnd so much of this is important to all three of us for every different reasons. And, first of all, we're going to go back to 2010 and the Let's Move! initiative, and this being an outgrowth of that, quite literally and figuratively.\nSo we're going to start in the place that I said we would, going back a little bit. And Craig and I have discovered, even in the last week, that if there were giant -- if there were surveillance back then, we would have been in the same playgrounds and pools and other places like that.\nMR. ROBINSON: Absolutely, absolutely.\nMR. WILBON: Okay, so I can -- and I've known Craig long enough, I can put him on the spot right away and ask you what kind of athlete your little sister was. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: You're putting him on the spot? Okay, all right. (Laughter.)\nMR. ROBINSON: First of all, let me just tell you, Mike brought his notes, and I had a packet of notes on my sister and she told me to put it back, put it down when we left the house. (Laughter.)\nBut you folks should know that how I got to be as good of an athlete as I was had to do with my little sister. Because growing up, we played everything together, and I mean everything. And somebody over there coughed and laughed, but she's actually -- might be the second-best athlete in the family behind my daughter. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: He's number three. Well, you might be four.\nMR. ROBINSON: I might be four now.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well now you've got two little ones, so you might be seventh. (Laughter.)\nMR. ROBINSON: But we used to play everything. And it started in the house, playing catch -- yes, we played catch in the house.\nMRS. OBAMA: And it was a little house.\nMR. ROBINSON: Have you seen Tiny House Nation? (Laughter.) That was our house.\nMRS. OBAMA: We were the originators. We were like, what's the big deal? That was our house. (Laughter.)\nMR. ROBINSON: It was a one-bedroom house where we used the dining room as the living room, and the living room was our bedroom. And it had a small hall that had to go from the end of the stage to right here, and we played catch, we played running bases, we played hockey, we played football, and we played basketball. And just yesterday, my sister said, I should be better at basketball than I am, and I had to remind her that we used to play Nerf basketball in the living room with the lamp shade and a Nerf basketball. This was before they had Nerf hoops. (Laughter.)\nAnd my mom's here -- remember we almost burned the house down because we left the ball in the lamp, and somebody turned the lamp on, and my mother was like, what's that I smell, is something burning? And we looked at each other like, ooh.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's the Nerf ball.\nMR. ROBINSON: It's the Nerf ball. (Laughter.) And it had a big burn hole in it.\nBut to get back to your question, Mike, my sister is very athletic. I mean, she was fast. She was coordinated, very good hand-eye. And we literally played every sport together until we got to the point where it got organized and I kept going and she couldn't because they didn't have organized girls --\nMR. WILBON: Found other great things to do. (Laughter.) We need to acknowledge your mom, Mrs. Robinson, who had to referee all those battles and oversee everything. (Applause.) Welcome, and thank you so much for -- and just jump right in any time you want to --\nMRS. OBAMA: And she's an athlete, too, actually.\nMR. ROBINSON: Oh, right. That's right.\nMRS. OBAMA: But that's a story for another day.\nMR. WILBON: What was it like, Mrs. Obama, for you growing up when you knew you had a big brother who was going to go on to, as it turns out, to big athletic things? Was there pressure to keep up? Was it automatically a spirit within you? Take us through those years.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, most of you know, my father, our father had MS, and he was an athlete. And before he contracted MS, he was a top-notch swimmer. He boxed. And then he went from being that man to being a man who couldn't walk without the assistance of a cane. And we really only knew him after MS. We saw pictures of him as an athlete, but sports were very important to my father. He was an avid fan, but it was important for him that we played.\nAnd he didn't distinguish because I was a girl. I remember we both got our first pair of boxing gloves together. Craig got his pair, and I had a little-bitty pair of boxing gloves. And I would beat the heck out of him. (Laughter.) Because the rule was I could go in on him, he had to kind of go light on me.\nBut our father got us engaged in this. And one of the things -- Craig and I, we don't take for granted activity, physical movement, because we know that when you have the blessing of being able to walk and run, you don't take it for granted. So I was in the middle of everything. So it really wasn't like he was the preferred athlete; I was in the middle of everything.\nAnd it was really, as Craig said, it wasn't until organized sports came into being, and there just weren't opportunities for girls. There were no basketball -- there weren't co-ed basketball leagues in our neighborhood. There weren't girls' leagues. I played softball, loved to play softball, but there were really no girls' teams. So I spent a lot of time as a spectator because the opportunities weren't there. So that's something that we have to really think of.\nNow, Title 9 has changed this so dramatically, and we're fortunate. And if you live in the right neighborhood, like our girls, you have access to a whole range of sports. But that wasn't the case. And if you don't have the money in this society, you can't afford it. Craig and I talk about the cost of keeping our kids in activities -- whether it's rec leagues or dance classes or whatever -- when the kids were little and they were doing everything, we were paying $8,000, $10,000 a year for fees, and uniforms, and new shoes because their feet keep growing. And what family can afford that?\nSo we're really limiting -- we're not developing our next level of fans and competitors. We are missing out on a whole generation of kids who were like me who could have been like me, who could have been like Craig, but they don't even have the opportunity. And we fell into that a little bit, but it was more because of gender rather than resources.\nMR. WILBON: It's been a passion of yours, too, for that gap to close completely; obviously, we start incrementally. But we should go back a little bit to Let's Move! and the sort of transition into this area now. Because that truly has become a passion of yours, hasn't it?\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, absolutely. We started with Let's Move, and a lot of it was about nutrition, because as a mom, I struggled with what many parents struggle with -- when you're busy and you've got two parents working, how are you feeding your kids? You're going through the drive-thru a little bit too much, you're incorporating processed foods a little bit too much. You're doing too much takeout. And nowadays, kids have a hundred million channels to choose from, they've got their iPhones and their iPads. So the whole range of physical activity has changed, and as a result we're seeing obesity rates increase.\nAnd you can see as a parent, being in it, and how that can happen. And I saw that as a parent. And I thought, well, here I am, a Princeton-Harvard-educated mom who thought she was doing everything right. And at a point when my kids were little, the pediatrician was like, well, you've got to watch these numbers, just tracking their weight and height on a regular basis. He was like, you've got to change what you're doing.\nAnd with some minor changes -- cooking a little bit more, putting in more fruits and vegetables, cutting out the sugary drinks -- we changed our kids' health outcomes in less than six months. And our pediatrician was like, what did you do, because whatever you did, I need to carry it through my whole pediatric practice.\nAnd that's when we started talking about how he was seeing just high rates of obesity because kids were having fast food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They weren't getting recess anymore. Sports were being taken away from the schools. So I thought, well, when we get here to the White House -- assuming that my husband wins -- we need to start informing parents about this. We need to start an education process. Because everybody wants to do the best thing for their kids, but if they don't have the information and they think that what they're doing is the right thing when it's absolutely the opposite of the right thing, how will we fix it.\nSo Let's Move! was the beginning of that, where we talked about nutrition. But you can't just talk about nutrition and not talk about physical activity, because it's all part of the same arm. So we eventually built on nutrition and started talking about physical activity, and on and on and on. And here we are today.\nMR. WILBON: And I mean schools -- this has to be a cooperative effort like we rarely see. And I want to ask you whether -- about that. Obviously, Craig, you have been involved at all levels of this, and at the highest level in terms of schools being involved. Take us through a little bit of what you saw and what you've seen recently, not just as a coach but also as a parent.\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, what I see, especially as a coach, but particularly as a parent, is you have the gamut of parenting. You have, on one end, the over-parenting, where parents are trying to sort of force their kids into sports. And on the other end, I've got -- my wife and I, Kelly, have a six-year-old and a four-year-old, and we have the parents who bring their kids to the soccer field and are on their phones and sort of not paying attention. And then you have kids who don't have the -- they don't have the benefit of either, who are inside playing video games somewhere because they're priced completely out of the sport market and the play market.\nAnd I think it really -- I mean, first and foremost, it starts with being able to play as a little kid. I mean, it's not safe to go outside and play. We talk about this all the time, that back in Chatham and in South Shore and the places that we grew up, there were rough neighborhoods, but not like now. You could go outside and run around and play on your block. So even if you weren't in organized sports, you could run and do stuff.\nMRS. OBAMA: And we would play all day, all day long. I mean, you would be rushing down your breakfast to go out, and kids would organize themselves. I mean, whether it was playing Piggy, which was a softball game -- we played this game with the kids in the neighborhood just called Chase. (Laughter.) I don't even know if there was a point to it, but you were just being chased for a good chunk of the morning.\nMR. WILBON: For hours.\nMRS. OBAMA: For hours, being chased. (Laughter.)\nMR. WILBON: I remember that.\nMR. ROBINSON: Oh, yeah, I remember that. And all you had to do was report back to the house every couple of hours. We had to -- hey, mom, I'm back, and then you went back out and you played. And this was from 9:30 in the morning until right before it got dark.\nMR. WILBON: One of the things that scares me -- this happened Sunday. I have an eight-year-old. And he is a play fanatic, everything, which makes me proud and happy. But we live in Bethesda, allegedly about as safe as it's going to get in metropolitan Washington, right? So I see my wife walking out of the house with a lawn chair around 2:00 on Sunday, and I say, what are you doing with this lawn chair? And she said, I'm going to go and sit and watch Matthew shoot. And I said, you're going to sit and watch him shoot? (Laughter.) First of all, he can shoot for hours because he thinks he's the next Steph Curry. And she literally was going to take a lawn chair just out near our garage space and watch him shoot on the next-door neighbor's basket.\nAnd I just thought, this is a different world in which we live. I mean, I would have gotten on a bike and come over to South Shore, gone to Tuley Park -- I mean, at not much older than he is, at 10 and 11 years old -- and played all day on the South Side and never thought for a second about being harmed. And I'm sure -- just like you, I'd check in -- you'd check in at some point so your parents knew you were well. But that is something that -- how do we address, how do we get our arms around that phenomenon?\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, it's going to be hard. And I think the days of going outside to play are over. So you have to kind of, as a parent, decide what's important. I mean, you have this leisure time -- and for us and for our parents, our dad and -- Miche talked about how he was handicapped -- it never precluded him from coming home from work and going outside with us. And it think you need more of that at a very early age so that you get trained in the mode of physical activity on a daily basis. And that's just the start.\nMRS. OBAMA: I mean, I hope the days of playing outside aren't over and done with. I mean, there are communities that are more challenged because the streets have been overrun with crime and so on and so forth, but there are still communities out there where people do live this life, where it is safe enough for kids to go out to play.\nBut now, you've got to make sure you have enough of them, because if everybody is in an organized sport, if everybody's time is structured and you're the parent who's trying to put play back in, well you send your kids out to play and there's nobody to play with, because everybody is booked. They're scheduled.\nAnd that's where the dilemma comes in -- either you can't play outside because it's unsafe, or you're the only kid playing outside because everybody else is over-specialized, right? Because the thing about when we were growing up and Craig was into sports, you did every sport. He played Little League, he played Bitty Basketball, he did the version of AAU basketball. But you weren't playing basketball for an entire year. You didn't have a shooting coach and a dribbling coach, and then you got your nutrition experts and your -- that's what I'm seeing now, is that kids now have to pick one sport at the age of 10, and then become, like, Tiger Woods, right? That's our version.\nSo you're taking them out of the mix of even just having a regular play life. And that's particularly true if your kid is athletic, because you feel like in order for them to compete, they have to be hyper focused on that sport. So you've got parents now who have a great athlete, and they'll be like, you can only play basketball because I don't want you to get injured playing touch football. They become a commodity, and then they don't even have the concept of play.\nRight now, I think if you put a bunch of kids out in a field today, I don't think they would know what to do. (Laughter.) We learned all these games -- Steal the Bacon and Duck, Duck, Goose -- all of these things you learned at recess and in P.E., which in -- let's remember, in a lot of urban settings, those opportunities, recess and gym, don't exist anymore for kids. So where are they even learning how to organize themselves socially so that when you put them in a field, they actually aren't looking at the grass, but they start to, like, organize themselves? Kids these days don't even know how to do that as well, because we've taken all those opportunities away from them.\nSo I hope it's not dead. There's a lot of things we can do to put it back in -- number one, making sure kids have recess at school. That's where they're spending most of their time. (Applause.) That is just as important as math and science to kids. If you're a teacher and you're working with boys in particular, they can't sit still for an entire school day. They can't physically do it.\nNow, I have girls, and watching his two little boys come over -- I mean, they wear me out when they walk in the door. I'm just like, fellas, sit down. They're always a little damp and sweaty and moist because they're moving all the time. (Laughter.) You touch them and it's like, why are you wet, little boy, get off of me! (Laughter.) My girls were dry for most of the time. (Laughter.)\nSo I feel for people with boys in today's school systems where you don't let them move. So how are we expecting them to be successful academically if the other part of their brain, that part that is movement and music and creativity, is not being exercised?\nMR. WILBON: That leads me to a point -- a question. I know you recently made an announcement in Times Square with the U.S. Olympic Team regarding access to sports for all kids. And Let's Move! obviously has been at the forefront of that. Why is it so important -- and I don't even -- it's difficult to ask you what can be done -- but for organizations in the private sector to value exactly what you're talking about and sort of get behind -- if there can be momentum built?\nMRS. OBAMA: It's absolutely necessary. I mean, if we're at the place now in our societies where we don't want to be taxed to make sure that schools have it, if that's what we're saying -- we're cutting it out because we don't want to pay for the P.E. teacher, we don't want to pay for the gym class, we don't want that to be a governmental responsibility -- well, then, it's up to all of you all corporate people. You've got to trickle it down if that's the theory.\nSo it becomes even more critical for the big sports companies to be those facilitators of those activities. Because if you look at it from a business standpoint, where is your fan base going to come from? If you've got girls who never see sports, if you've got kids who've never touched a basketball, who are you recruiting? And who's going to watch the Olympics if kids don't know what half these sports are?\nI mean, kids watch this stuff because they want to play it. They're not spectators. So if we want the Olympics to continue to thrive, then we need to facilitate some fans and some excitement. Those are those kids in the street who don't have recess anymore.\nSo if we've taken it out of the schools and we don't value it, then it is going to be absolutely imperative for corporate America to go into these schools and put some gym and some sports back in. In the schools we grew up in -- and it's different from the schools my kids go to -- private schools where they have a sport -- almost every sport, every team for boys and girls -- because the tuition is so high. You go to a public school in the inner city and maybe they have a basketball team, in middle school. Maybe. But you don't even get to really play sports until you go to high school, and that's if your high school can afford a sport. But they won't have field hockey. They'll either have basketball or football, maybe a girls' team. If you don't have a pool, you're not going to have a swim team.\nI mean, let's just sort of think about what we've structured here for this generation. These are our kids. So if we're not going to do it through the school systems, and we've decided that as a people as a society that that's too expensive, or we don't trust that system to do it, then who else is going to do it? We're just going to let sports just fritter away in our culture?\nSo who's going to watch the next Olympics? Because these kids won't be interested in it if they don't know anything about it.\nMR. WILBON: Well, Craig, it seems like coaches are going to have to be at the forefront of any cooperative with the private sector, because the private sector, even if -- obviously, financing this, not going to have the knowledge, the know-how to apply it. How do coaches fit in? Are you seeing coaches being hired in these capacities to sort of help this movement?\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, in a word, no. What we're missing is we're missing that guy -- my old AU coach, Johnny Gage (ph) was a -- at the time, I thought he was much older than I was, but he coached us at the age of 19. He's coaching 13-year-olds. And he wanted to be a coach. And you're not seeing a lot of those folks anymore. Everybody is moving away to do something different.\nThat's one. So you don't see as many young coaches. They're gravitating to sort of trying to get into the high-priced college and pro game. So you don't have grassroots guys, which then puts it back on the parents.\nAnd our first coach was our father. I mean, he coached us every day. We were out there playing, get down on the ground, baseball position, get your elbow in when you shoot; this is how you swim. And if we're not going to get professional coaches to help us do this, we've got to, as a society, take responsibility as parents to do it, no matter how busy we are.\nMR. WILBON: What sort of things -- I know you were involved in -- I don't know how you keep in the balls in the air. But to that end, Craig, tell us about some of the things you're involved in now in addition to working and parenting.\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, in addition to, let's see, working at ESPN, and I've got four kids -- one is working, one is in college and then two younger kids -- as much as I can, I love going around and telling our story of how important athletics, sports, activity was in our lives.\nAnd it was not as if our parents used it as a motivator, either -- oh, if you don't get good grades, you can't play sports. It was just part of the fabric of growing up, just like you get up in the morning, you eat, you go outside and play on days when you didn't have school. And when you were at school, you did your schoolwork, and then you went outside and played.\nSo what I'm spending time doing is working and going around and talking about that in hopes that we as parents sort of embrace the fact that we have these children. We have to keep them active. Nobody is going to keep them active for us.\nMR. WILBON: Mrs. Obama, I wanted to ask you about Project Play -- a report recently recognizing that sports participation rates among youth living in households with the lowest incomes are about half that of youth from wealthier homes. And we talked about this early. Are there other ways that we should be looking at to close that gap and make people understand why it's important?\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, at some point, it's going to require an investment. So the question is, where do you make that investment? In the past, we made the investment in school, because everybody went to school or goes to school. So that was the easiest place -- recess, gym, sports in school. That costs money. We hit a wall, so we stopped investing.\nSo then the next level of investment comes in youth centers, sports clubs. But again, that's an investment because you've got to have places with gyms, and you've got hire staff, you've got to have equipment, you have to -- so if you look to the Boys and Girls Clubs, or youth leagues, that still requires and investment.\nSo at some level, we have to kind of ask ourselves how much are we willing to invest in the kids in our society? Because at some point, we've got to make that investment, even if it's an investment in better parks in every community, creating safe spaces where kids can go out to play. On the South Side, now, we had parks, and some of those parks just aren't -- they haven't been maintained. The sports fields don't work, the swings are broken.\nIn so many communities you have a place for a park, but it's going to take an investment to make it a place that kids will actually use. So where does that investment come from? That's the city. So we don't want to do that anymore, so it's just -- slowly it's becoming a desert, a play desert. So many communities are becoming play deserts.\nBut in wealthy communities, there is a wealth of resources. You can be in field hockey, or you can learn how to swim. There are aquatic centers and -- I've seen the difference. The disparities are amazing to me. So are we saying that some kids are worthy of that investment and physical activity, and then there are millions of others who aren't? And what's the role that we as a society have for making sure that kids have equal access?\nBut that's also true for music and art, and all of these wonderful things. That why Let's Move! is so important to me, because my view is, as a parent, is if I think this is important for my kids, it's important for every kid. So it can't be good enough that my kid has it if the vast majority of kids in this country don't have it. Because who are my kids going to play with? Who are they going to compete against?\nAnd I just hope that we get out of that mentality of \"I got mine over here, and as long as mine are good, good luck.\" It's that \"eat or be eaten\" kind of -- but that's basically what we're doing when it comes to sports. Because we're okay going into some neighborhoods where there isn't even a field, but in other communities, there is every field -- there are more fields than there are kids. There are more opportunities than there are kids.\nBut we have to kind of look at ourselves and say, how did we get here, and why is that okay? Because right now it's okay. We're okay with that. And that's sad.\nMR. WILBON: The most dramatic instance of that I've ever seen was when I was working as a reporter at the Washington Post. And literally, the 24 hours in the aftermath of the riots in L.A. in 1990 -- what, 1991, or 1992. My sports editor had a brilliant idea. He said, look, why don't you go out to Los Angeles, find out if there's any connection between the people who are -- we are seeing on Nightline every night, the Crips and Bloods, and lack of opportunity to play the way they used to.\nAnd my initial reaction was, what? This is a stretch. So I got on a plane and went to L.A. And I got lucky in that I ran into Crips and Bloods who were literally at the forefront of trying to negotiate a peace settlement. And a couple of guys recognized me from television, and they said, hey, what are you doing out here? And I said, I want to know if there's any sort of connection. What did you guys used to do? What did you do at 10, 11 and 12 years old, and do you still play? Do you still -- and all these guys are between 18 and 25 at this point. And they say, you know what, what are you doing tomorrow morning? And I said, I'll do whatever you tell me. And they said, we're going to pick you up and take you and show you.\nAnd literally, they drove me through South Central and other parts of L.A. where fields were overgrown, where field houses and youth activity centers were closed. And they talked about -- and they had photos of the times they used to play with and against each other, and instead of Dodgers and Angels and Cubs and Yankees, they became Crips and Bloods.\nAnd it was a startling revelation -- perhaps it shouldn't have been -- because the problems in South Central could have been -- we could have named a city, right? What urban area is that different -- that was playing out because of the riots and the days after Rodney King. But it was a stunning thing.\nAnd I wound up writing stories on A1 about it for the Washington Post, and I hope people didn't feel it was 3,000 miles removed. Because it could have been Southeast or Northeast or the South Side. And we're lucky -- I drive out to those parks, by the way. I drive out to West Chatham and Tuley just to see what's going on, and if they're still viable, the places that we played.\nMRS. OBAMA: And are they?\nMR. WILBON: And some are, but not nearly as many as we had access to.\nMRS. OBAMA: When we were growing up. Well, we can't be surprised with what kids do with idle time. And that's sort of one of the things -- when we look at crime rates and all that sort of stuff, it's like, these are a bunch of bored kids that are unsupervised who don't know how to play. If we start there -- and then we give them a gun. And then you've got such a lethal combination.\nWhy can't we put those things together? Why are we confused about why crime rates are going up? It's not a complicated set of scenarios, unless people don't really understand just what a wasteland so many kids are living in in terms of activity. Maybe that's the case. Maybe people look at their lives and think, well, if my kids have it, then it couldn't be that bad. It is that bad.\nWe are raising kids and whole communities where there is no place for them to play. There's nothing for them to play with, nobody to play with, no supervision. And we wonder why they just go off on society.\nSo this is essential, not to mention the whole socialization piece. I mean, look at all the things we learned just by playing. We learned problem-solving. We learned how to communicate. We learned how to resolve differences without an adult being there. We learned how to organize our time when we were bored. We learned --\nMR. ROBINSON: Team work. We learned leadership. We were talking the other day -- my four-year-old is learning math because he's trying to keep score when he's playing against his brother. And there's just so many things that people who have decided to remove athletics and sports and recreation from the system -- sort of like unintended consequences that they didn't think about.\nMR. WILBON: Yes, I don't know that mine would be able to count, except he can get basketball scores -- he'd probably be able to get earned run average. That'll be the advanced math.\nI guess we should probably close here soon. There's some fascinating things in all sort of areas we could go into, but obviously, we'd be remiss without talking about some possible solutions and whether or not we think we can get to the place that we all would like to arrive with being able to reinstate, for starters, some of the things -- I mean, we've gone backward, clearly, in this area.\nI mean, looking at the places that were available, the opportunities that were available to us when money wasn't at the forefront of it. Now you guys are scaring me, talking about these fees. Because with an eight-year-old, I'm just coming into that.\nMRS. OBAMA: Get ready. You've got to save up for play these days. You've got to have a play scholarship fund. (Laughter.) You've got college scholarship, and then you've got just play. It's going to cost you.\nMR. WILBON: The fees I'm starting to recognize. What sorts of areas would you like to see initiated? What sort of recommendations? Craig, let's start with you.\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, clearly, my sister is right on point with corporate America, but not just corporate America is going to see this. I think it's places that you and I work for, like ESPN, who have such a broad reach and are reliant upon future sports fans. They have to be a stakeholder, which they are, but has to continue.\nThe shoe companies who make a ton of money off of these same young kids, but not because they're wearing their shoes out playing, they're wearing them out as --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Fashion --\nMR. ROBINSON: -- I heard somebody over there, as a fashion statement. That is exactly right. You need to have places like Nike and Adidas and Under Armor be your stakeholders.\nI would be remiss if -- you've got to have your professional athletes, the guys who have made it, have to -- as hard as it is, they have to be a standard-bearer for this. It is really a team effort. And that's just to start, from my perspective.\nAnd then, as I keep harping on, it has to be the family. I mean, it's tough for families who don't have a lot, and a single-parent family where the mom or the dad is doing everything on their own. They come home from work, they're too tired to play -- well, I had both my parents, but I don't get it because my dad had MS and he was out there every day working a swing shift, and he's taking us up to the park and pitching to her, and I'm catching out in the field, and we're playing a three-person baseball game.\nSo that's just to start. And I think we can do it.\nMRS. OBAMA: We have to. This isn't something that's an option. It's the thing that keeps our society healthy and whole. It's the investment we make in that next generation.\nBut I would say -- there are so many great programs already out there. This is the thing -- this is where the investment comes in. Just like with schools, we know what great schools look like. It's not like it's a mystery. There are thousands of really great school -- public schools and charter schools, and you name them. The question is how do we replicate the good stuff? It's an investment.\nAnd the same thing is true with a whole range of programs. We have Let's Move! in schools, where Nike is working to help teachers think of creative ways to put movement back into the school day. You've got a lot of corporations that are already sponsoring some really good initiatives. You've got -- in some cities, where they've found how important sports can be in community policing in South Central L.A. You've got police officers who are setting up football leagues, and they're redeveloping whole relationships between law enforcement and kids in those communities.\nIf we wanted to just line up all the programs that are working and find out which ones are really working and why and which ones work in urban settings and rural settings, we probably already have the answers. Now we have to scale it. And that goes back to priority, intent, and investment. Because none of it is free. We've just shifted the burden back on families to say, it's up to you: So if you have resources, you're going to be good. But if you don't, well, your kids are going to be hanging out in the street, and then we'll be mad at you because you don't your kids under control.\nBut this has to become a priority in our society. We can't just sort of think that, well, kids in play, I mean, we can figure this out, this isn't my problem. This is all of our problems. From the government to the military -- this is where Mark was talking about -- kids who aren't playing sports show up at training unprepared to serve because you put a backpack on a kid who doesn't run or hasn't run and tell them to run 10 miles, they fracture something, and then who's got to pay for that? Or if they're not eating well -- because they've had soda most of their live, now they have dental issues that the military is covering.\nThis affects all of us. Play and nutrition and overall investment in our kids -- whether they can read and think and engage -- it's just not enough for us to be okay with so many kids not having that at an excellent level.\nSo whatever the dollar figure is, as a society, as taxpayers and as corporate America and who -- we should figure out how much that costs, and then pay for it. Period. (Applause.)\nMR. WILBON: Yes, because we'd pay a lot less on the front end than we'd do on the back.\nJust as a way of closing, it starts with all of us, those of us who, whether we're entrepreneurial and have our own things going on, or whether we're working for entities that need to be invested locally -- and by locally, I mean the most local way, right there, right at home. When you see the neglect that has to be reversed and proactively, children who need to be introduced to this if they're not already. And obviously, Let's Move! and Project Play have been at the forefront of this for a while now, and I think we should thank Craig and thank the First Lady again for coming to discuss something that's so vital and important and compelling to any community -- thank them for being here, both of you, and taking your time to discuss this. It's fascinating.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well then, Mike, let me also thank the people in this room who have prioritized it. This is a room full of people who are putting these issues front and center. And I'm grateful to all of you all. I can start Let's Move! and get some attention around it, but, as I say to many of you when I meet you, you all are the ones doing the hard work on the ground every day.\nAnd I know it has been a lonely fight. It's been a lonely mission. But I for one, as First Lady of the United States, I'm grateful to all of you for the passion and commitment you show to our next generation. And we just need more of you, that's all. You have to go replicate yourselves and recruit more people.\nBut we're in a room full of folks right here who are prioritizing it, making it front and center, putting the investment in, putting in the elbow grease, the love.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123334", "text": "Hello! Thank you! Thank you, Carson! [applause]\nLet me -- let me begin by thanking all of you. What a fantastic turnout. Thank you so much. [applause]\nAnd let me thank Jim Sobel, and Nick Zano, and Francis Fisher, and Hollis Longwear, and Adriana Aravalo, and Gil Sedilio, Kendrick Sampson -- and let me give a special thanks to a very good friend of mine and one of the great actors in our country, Danny Glover. [applause]\nDanny is not only an extraordinary actor but, as many of you know, he has spent his entire adult life fighting for economic justice, social justice, racial justice. Danny, thank you for all that you have done. [applause]\nLet me also take this opportunity to say a word of thanks to the people of Kentucky. In a closed primary -- something I am not all that enthusiastic about where independents are not allowed to vote... [boos] ... where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 250,000 votes in 2008, it ends up tonight we're going to end up with about half of the delegates from Kentucky. [applause]\nI want to thank you all for coming out because this is, in a sense, the beginning of the final push to win California. [applause]\nWhen we -- and by the way, I should tell you that there are a lot of people out there -- many of the pundits and politicians -- they say \"Bernie Sanders should drop out.\" [boos]\n\"The people of California should not have the right to determine who the next president will be.\" [boos]\nWell, let me be as clear as I can be. I agree with you. We are in until the last ballot is cast. [applause]\nYou know, when we began this campaign a little over a year ago, we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton in the polls. We had no political organization, no money, very little name recognition. The media and the pundits determined that we were a fringe candidacy. [boos]\nAnd nobody -- nobody thought that this campaign was going anywhere. And on top of all of that, we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the country; an organization that elected Bill Clinton twice and ran a strong campaign for Hillary Clinton in 2008. [boos]\nWell, a lot has changed in the last year. [applause]\nAs of today, we have won 19 state primaries and caucuses and over 9 million votes. [applause]\nNo one can predict the future, but I think we have a real shot to win primaries in a number of the states that will be coming up. [applause]\nAnd don't tell Secretary Clinton; she might get nervous. I think we're going to win here in California. [applause]\nAnd as all of you know, California has 475 pledged delegates. [applause]\nAnd let me mention something else. I am especially proud that in, I believe, every primary and caucus, those we won and those we lost, we have received a significant majority of the votes of young people. [applause]\nAnd by the way -- and by the way, one -- you know one of the things about getting older, the older you get, you know -- well, yeah -- people who are older appear to be younger. That's what it is. So, we are winning people 45 years of age or younger and what that tells me is that our vision, a vision of social justice, economic justice, racial justice, and environmental justice, that is the future of this country. [applause]\nAs of today, I am proud to tell you that taking on virtually the entire democratic establishment, almost all of the Senators, the Members of the House, mayors, governors -- we have won over 45% of the pledged delegates. [applause]\nAnd in a couple of weeks if we can win big in New Jersey, New Mexico, North and South Dakota, Montana, California, we have the possibility. It will be a steep climb. I recognize that. But we have the possibility of going to Philadelphia with the majority of the pledged delegates. [applause]\nNow, some people say that we've got a steep hill to climb to do that, and that is absolutely true. But you know what? Together we have been climbing that steep hill from day one in this campaign, and we're going to continue to fight for every last vote until June 14, and then we're going to take our fight into the convention. [applause]\nYou know, there is -- there is a lot of discussion about the role of super-PACs. [boos]\nAnd I am very proud to tell you I am the only candidate running for president who does not have a super-PAC. We made a decision when we began this campaign that we were not going to beg Wall Street, or corporate America, or billionaires for campaign contributions. And as of today, without a super-PAC, we have received almost 8 million individual campaign contributions. Anybody know what that average contribution is? That's right, $27. And what that shows the world, in a time when big money is dominating our political process, is that you can run a strong, winning national campaign without begging billionaires for campaign contributions. [applause]\nLet me -- let me also mention something that a lot of people may not be aware of and that is that virtually every national and state poll taken in the last six weeks -- in all of those polls, we are defeating Donald Trump. [applause]\nAnd not only are we defeating Trump, in most cases by double digits, in almost every case, whether -- in almost every case, whether it is a national poll or state poll, we do much better against Trump then does Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nA poll just came out -- I think it was yesterday in the state of Georgia -- not a very good state for us -- Trump was beating Secretary Clinton by four points, and we were beating him by five points.\nIf the Democratic -- if the Democratic Party wants to be certain that Donald Trump is defeated -- and that we must do -- we, together, are the campaign to do that. And it is not just -- it is not just the polls -- the polls go up, the polls go down. What it is, is that our campaign has the energy and the enthusiasm and the grassroots capability. [applause]\nThe grassroots capability to make certain that in November, in the general election, we have a huge voter turnout. Here is a political truism: when the voter turnout is low, and people are demoralized and don't come out to vote, Republicans win. When there is excitement, and energy, and people are prepared to stand up and fight back, progressives and Democrats win -- that is our campaign. [applause]\nI don't have to explain to anybody here that the American people will not elect a candidate like Donald Trump who insults Mexicans and Latinos. [boos]\nWho insults Muslims; who insults women and veterans; and who is a leader of the so-called birther movement, tries to delegitimize the presidency of our first African-American president. [boos]\nWe will not accept as President a man who wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to billionaire families like his, but who has told us that we do not have to worry about raising the starvation minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. We will not accept a President who recklessly talks about using nuclear weapons and who changes his mind every day on every issue. [boos]\nLet me also say a word to the leadership of the Democratic Party. And that is -- that is -- that the Democratic Party is going to have to make a very, very profound and important decision. It can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change. [applause]\nThat is the Democratic Party I want to see, bringing in people who are willing to take on Wall Street; to take on corporate greed; and to take on a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. So I say to the leadership of the Democratic Party, open the door, let the people in.\nOr, the other option -- the other option for the Democratic Party, which I see as a very sad and tragic option, is the truce to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big money campaign contributions, and be a party with limited participation and limited energy; and a party which, incredibly, is allowing a right- wing extremist Republican Party to capture the votes of a majority of working people in this country. Now, I come from the working class of this country, and I will be damned -- I will be damned if we will allow the Republican Party, whose job is to represent the rich and the powerful, to win the votes of working-class Americans. Let me say a word about why I think this campaign is doing so well. You know why? Because we are doing something very unusual. We are telling the American people the truth. [applause]\nAnd here is a very important truth. If we as a nation do not get our act together, this great nation is going to slip into in oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control our political and economic life. Let me tell you how absurd it is. It was just announced the other day, the Koch brothers -- the second wealthiest family in America, a family worth tens of billions of dollars, extremely right-wing -- are contributing over $40 million to try and make the United States Senate stay Republican; $40 million. And here is what is even crazier -- a guy named Sheldon Adelson, also one of the wealthiest people in America -- this is a billionaire who is prepared to contribute huge sums of money to another billionaire, named Donald Trump. The American people are sick and tired of billionaires running our economy and our political lives. [applause]\nTogether, we are going to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, and we are going to move toward public funding of elections. I want this country to be a vibrant democracy, and that means whether you're progressive, conservative, or moderate, if you want to run for office, you should not have to beg millionaires for campaign contributions. [applause]\nI want this country to have one of the highest voter turnout rates in the world, not one of the lowest. But before we will have the opportunity to defeat Donald Trump, we are going to have to defeat Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nA campaign is about issues and ideas, and let me very briefly and straight-forwardly tell you some of the differences between Secretary Clinton and myself:\nNumber one, I am proud to tell you I don't have a super-PAC and I don't get money from Wall Street. Secretary Clinton has a number of super-PACs, and in the last filing period, reported receiving $15 million from Wall Street. Our job is to take on Wall Street, not take their money. [applause]\nFederal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. Secretary Clinton wants to raise that to $12 an hour. That is OK. but it is not good enough.\nHold that sign up, let everybody see it. We are talking about a fight for $15 an hour. I am proud to tell you, I have been on the picket line with those workers. They are standing up and fighting for a living wage, and all of us will stand with them. [applause]\nMy wife just tells me that CNN has called Oregon for Bernie Sanders. [applause]\nWe won. You know, we won a great victory in the state of Washington a few months ago. We just won Oregon. [applause]\nAnd we are going to win California. [applause]\nI am getting to like the West Coast. [applause]\nThis campaign -- when we talk about equitable wages, it is not just that -- you know, raising the minimum wage to a living wage. It is also ending the disgrace of women making $.79 on the dollar compared to men. And together, I know that every man here will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity. [applause]\nI am a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Environment and I will tell you what all of you know, and that is that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity and, as everybody in California knows, it is already causing devastating problems. You in California have witnessed the devastating impact of climate change with your own eyes. You have seen historic wildfires, which scorched 118,000 acres of land here in California in 2014. You have seen massive mudslides; you have seen rising sea levels; you experienced a massive heatwave in 2006. We have a moral obligation -- a moral obligation to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels... [applause] ... to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause]\nIn my view, if we are prepared to be aggressive in transforming our energy system, we need a tax on carbon. We cannot allow, with impunity, the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet. I believe in a tax on carbon because I see climate change as one of the great global crises that we face. Secretary Clinton does not support a tax on carbon. [boos]\nOne of the great crises that we are beginning to see unfold is whether or not, in our country and around the world, we will have the clean drinking water that our people need. And that is why I believe we should move for a ban on fracking. [applause]\nThat is my view. Unfortunately, it is not Secretary Clinton's view. In fact -- in fact, when she was Secretary of State, she pushed fracking technology onto countries around the world. [boos]\nThe great -- the great foreign policy debate -- the most important debate that we have had in the modern history of our country centered around Iraq, and whether to go into Iraq. I listened very carefully to what President Bush, and Dick Cheney, and the others had to say. I voted against that war. [applause]\nSecretary Clinton voted for that war. [boos]\nI believe that when you have a handful of large financial institutions on Wall Street -- institutions who have a business model of fraud; institutions which through their illegal behavior and their greed drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great depression -- I believe that now is the time to break them up! [applause]\nThat is my view. That is not Secretary Clinton's view. [boos]\nOne of the reasons that the middle class of this country has been in decline for the last 35 years has to do with a disastrous trade policy which has ended up shutting down thousands of factories in America, as companies shut down here -- the workers out on the street -- and move to China and other low-wage countries. [boos]\nI voted against every one of those disastrous trade agreements. [applause]\nSecretary Clinton supported almost all of them. [boos]\nWhat this campaign is about is whether or not we are going to create an economy that works for all of us, or an economy that continues to work for the 1 percent. [boos]\nIt is not acceptable to me that in America today we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on Earth. It is worse now than at any time since 1928. It is not acceptable that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. It is not acceptable to me that in my state of Vermont, and here in California, and all over this country, we have millions of people who are working not one job, but two jobs and three jobs to cobble together the income and health care they need. And yet, when mom works, dad works, and the kids work, it adds up that 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. That is not acceptable. [boos]\nThis campaign is listening to the American people, and not just to wealthy campaign contributors. [applause]\nThis campaign is listening to young people. [applause]\nAnd young people are asking me \"how does it happen that when they do the right thing, when they go out and get the best education they can, they end up $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt?\" [boos]\nWe should not be punishing people for getting an education; we should reward them. [applause]\nForty or 50 years ago, if you had a high school degree, you were in pretty good shape. You could go out and get yourself a good job. Those days, by and large, are gone. We have a changing economy, changing technology, and a changing global economy. We need to have the best educated workforce in the world. [applause]\nAnd that means that when we think about public education, it is not good enough now just to think about first grade through 12th grade. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition free. [applause]\nI want every kid in California in the fourth grade, and in sixth grade -- kids in Vermont -- to understand that if they study hard and take school seriously, no matter what the income their family is, they will be able to get a college education. [applause]\nHow many people here are carrying student debt right now? [applause]\nI have talked to people all over this country -- people $50,000, 100,000 -- $100,000 in debt. For what crime did they commit? That they went out and got a decent education? That is crazy stuff. So we are going to give people with student debt the right to refinance their loans at the lowest interest rate they can find. [applause]\nAnd people say -- you know, my critics say \"Well, Bernie, you're Santa Claus. You're giving away free tuition; you're going to lower student debt; how are going to you pay for it? I will tell you exactly how we will pay for it. In 2009, Congress, against my vote, bailed out the crooks on Wall Street. Today, Wall Street is doing just fine, and I think it is appropriate to impose a tax on Wall Street speculations. [applause]\nAnd that tax will more than pay for free tuition and public colleges and universities and in lowering student debt. [applause]\nNow, Wall Street does not like that idea, and I say, so what?\nIf we win this election, Wall Street and the other people who now run this country, are going to learn a very profound lesson. And that is, they will not continue to get it all. [applause]\nI am sick and tired of the greed of corporate America and the greed of Wall Street. We need a new moral compass in this country. [applause]\nYou know, Pope Francis talks about a moral economy -- a moral economy, and I agree with him. That is what we need. [applause]\nThis campaign is listening to our Latino brothers and sisters. [applause]\nMy father -- my father came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, so I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. [applause]\nThere are 11 million undocumented people in this country today. Many of them are being exploited on the job because when you don't have legal rights -- when you don't have legal rights, you can't stand up and protect yourself. And that is why I believe we must pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship. [applause]\nAnd that is why I believe we must stop, immediately, the current deportation policy. And if Congress does not do its job, I will use the executive powers of the presidency to do it right. [applause]\nThis campaign is listening to our brothers and sisters in the African-American community. [applause]\nAnd they are asking me a very simple but important question; how does it happen that this country has trillions of dollars to spend on a war in Iraq we never should have gotten into, but, somehow, we don't have the available funds to rebuild our inner cities? [applause]\nI have been to Flint, Michigan and visited with parents whose children have been poisoned by lead in the water. [boos]\nI have been to Detroit, Michigan where their public school system is on the verge of a physical collapse. [boos]\nI have been to Baltimore, Maryland where tens of thousands of people are addicted to drugs and do not have the treatment available to get them off that heroin. [boos]\nWe, as a nation, together, are going to change our national priorities. [applause]\nWe are going to rebuild our inner cities, build affordable housing, and create decent schools for our children. [applause]\nAnd this campaign is listening to people whose pain is almost never heard, and that is our Native American brothers and sisters. [applause]\nWe owe the first Americans a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. They have taught us so much, including the very important lesson that as human beings -- all of us are part of nature. We must live with nature. [applause]\nAnd, we cannot continue to destroy nature, because if we destroy nature, we are destroying ourselves. [applause]\nTogether, this campaign, and our presidency are going to reform a broken criminal justice system. [applause]\nIt is not acceptable, I believe, to any of us, that we have 2.2 million people in jail today, more than any other country on Earth. [boos]\nInstead of seeing kids around this country in inner cities or rural America, experiencing 40 percent, 50 percent unemployment rates, we are going to put those kids to work in good jobs. And we are going to invest in education for them, not jail or incarceration. [applause]\nWe want this country to be the best-educated country on Earth, not the country with more people in jail. [applause]\nWhat this campaign is about is thinking outside of the box, outside of the status quo. Every other major country on Earth, whether it's the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Scandinavia, Canada -- every major country guarantees health care to all of their people as a right. [applause]\nThe Affordable Care Act has done some very good things, but we have a lot more to do. I believe, from the deepest part of my soul, that health care is a right, not a privilege. [applause]\nToday, we have 29 million peoples with no insurance, even more who are underinsured, with large deductibles and copayments. And every one of us is getting ripped off by the greed of the drug companies. [boos]\nPharmaceutical industries charge us by far the highest prices in the world for the medicine we need. By the way, on the ballot in November here in California, you are going to have a proposition making sure that California can control the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. [applause]\nI congratulate those people who put that item on the ballot -- let's pass it. [applause]\nTogether, we will end the fact that we are the only country -- major country without health care for all -- that we pay far more per capita for health care than any other country. We are going to end that by passing a Medicare-for-all health care system. [applause]\nNow, the insurance companies may not like it; the drug companies may not like it. But the American people do like it, and that's what we've got to do. [applause]\nThis campaign understands a very, very important historical lesson. That lesson is that no real change has ever occurred in our country from the top on down. It has always been from the bottom on up. [applause]\nThink back -- think back 120 years ago, when workers in this country were forced to work seven days a week, 14 hours a day. They had no rights on the job. Think about the children -- 10, 11 years of age, losing fingers in factories, and what the working people of this country said. Sorry, we are human beings, we are not beasts of burden. We are going to form trade unions and negotiate contracts. [applause]\nAnd I thank the trade union movement for creating the American middle class. [applause]\nThink about 150 years ago, in the midst of the abomination of slavery. There were African Americans and their allies who were prepared to go to jail to get beaten, to get lynched, who stood up and said that they will come in this country when we will end racism, and bigotry, and segregation. [applause]\nAnd over the years, millions of people were engaged in that struggle. Think about where we were as a country 100 years ago -- not such a long time ago. 100 years ago, women in America did not have the right to vote. They could not get the education or the job they wanted. But women stood up and fought back. [applause]\nWomen stood up to the establishment, which said to them \"Your job is to stay home and have babies.\" [boos]\nBut women said \"You will not define us. We will define ourselves.\" [applause]\nAnd women and their male allies said loudly and clearly \"Women in America will not be second-class citizens.\" [applause]\nIf we were here ten years ago -- no time at all -- somebody jumps up and says \"You know Bernie, I think that, say, by the year 2015, gay marriage will be legal in every state in this country.\" [applause]\nIf somebody said that, the person next to them would have said \"You are nuts.\" What happened? But what happened is the gay community and their straight allies stood up against incredible bigotry. [applause]\nAgainst all kinds of abuse. And they said together that in this country, people should have the right to love whoever they want, regardless of their gender. [applause]\nAnd let me give you a more contemporary example. If five years ago, somebody here stood up and said \"Bernie, this $7.25 minimum wage, that's really awful and terrible, we've got to raise it to 15 bucks an hour\", the person next to him what have said \"$15 an hour? You are nuts. You are thinking too radically. You are an extremist.\" But then, what happened? We've got some of them here -- workers in the fast food industry went out on strike.\nWorkers -- workers in McDonalds, and in Burger King, and in Wendy's and Subway, and in all these places, they told their community and they told the world they cannot live on $7.25 an hour. And you know what happened after the strikes and demonstrations in Seattle, here in Los Angeles, in San Francisco? Fifteen dollars an hour. [applause]\nAnd if I have anything to say about it -- and I will as President -- $15 an hour in every state in this country. [applause]\nWhat is my point? Here is my point. Throughout -- let me kick off my point, but I want to...[laughter]...I want you to think about this: throughout history -- throughout history, people looked around them. If they were a worker, working seven days a week with no power, they saw that as being unjust, unfair. They stood up and they fought back. In the days of terrible segregation and slavery, people said \"America will not be racist.\" Women fought back. The gay community fought back. Low income workers fought back. That's what change is about.\nAnd right now -- right now, from coast-to-coast -- and I have been from Maine to California -- I have seen millions of people looking around them, and they're saying \"Wait a second, what is going on in our country where we have such a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent? What is going on when the middle class continues to disappear, and we have more children -- we have a higher rate of childhood poverty that almost any country on Earth? What is going on when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave? Not to guarantee health care to all people? What is going on when women are making 79 cents on the dollar?\" [boos]\nAnd when young people are leaving school $50,000 in debt. [boos]\nThough what the establishment wants you to believe is that real change effectively dealing with these issues is impossible -- it's too big, it's too radical. [boos]\nThe options they want to give you -- the media wants to give you, Congress wants to give you -- should we cut food stamps or should we cut education? [boos]\nWe do not accept those choices. We're going to ask... [applause]\nAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality -- yeah, we are going to tell the wealthiest people in largest corporations, they are going to start paying their fair share in taxes. [applause]\nIf the American people are prepared to reject the Donald Trumps of the world who want to divide us up -- they want to divide us up -- but if we stand together as black, and white, and Latino, and Asian American, and Native American; if we stand together as gay and straight, male and female...[applause]\nIf we stand together as people born in this country and people who come into this country. [applause]\nIf we stand together and have the courage to take on the billionaire class -- to demand a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent -- together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.\nAs all of you know, in a few weeks there is going to be of an enormously important primary here in California. [applause]\nAnd what I have found throughout this campaign is that we win primaries and caucuses when the voter turnout is high. We lose when it is low. Let us have, in the California Democratic primary, the largest voter turnout in the history of the state. [applause]\nAnd let this great state show the world that you are prepared to help lead our nation into the political revolution. Thank you very much.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Burma that was declared on May 20, 1997, is to continue in effect beyond May 20, 2016.\nThe Government of Burma has made significant progress across a number of important areas since 2011, including the release of over 1,300 political prisoners, a peaceful and competitive election, the signing of a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with eight ethnic armed groups, the discharge of hundreds of child soldiers from the military, steps to improve labor standards, and expanding political space for civil society to have a greater voice in shaping issues critical to Burma's future. In addition, Burma has become a signatory of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol and ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, significant steps towards supporting global non-proliferation. Despite these strides, the situation in the country continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\nConcerns persist regarding continued obstacles to full civilian control of the government, the ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in the country, particularly in ethnic minority areas, and military trade with North Korea. In addition, Burma's security forces, operating with little oversight from the civilian government, often act with impunity. We are further concerned that prisoners remain detained and that police continue to arrest critics of the government for peacefully expressing their views. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma.\nDespite this action, the United States remains committed to working with both the new government and the people of Burma to ensure that the democratic transition is irreversible.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nMay 17, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-05-17", "title": "Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117428", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:10 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do have a quick statement at the top before we get to questions. As I'm sure you are aware, today Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are doing their jobs and fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities by reviewing Chief Judge Garland's questionnaire and holding a public meeting to learn more about this highly qualified nominee.\nOne of the individuals they have invited to the Senate today to speak in support of Chief Judge Garland's character and credentials is a man named Timothy Lewis. Mr. Lewis is a retired former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. In his written remarks, Judge Lewis noted, \"For anyone who questions, as most Americans do, the Senate's treatment of Judge Garland's nomination to the United States Supreme Court, I am living proof that it doesn't have to be this way.\" As Judge Lewis notes, he was nominated in the fall of 1992, weeks before a presidential election. He was nominated by a Republican President to serve on the Court of Appeals. He had a hearing before a Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee and was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate on October 8th, just three weeks before the election.\nThat's one way in which his testimony today is interesting. And there's a second. Later in his career, Judge Lewis returned to Congress to testify on behalf of his 3rd Circuit colleague, Sam Alito. At the time, Judge Lewis noted that he did not share Justice Alito's \"conservative ideology,\" but that he \"found him to be a good person and a fine judge, intellectually honest, highly principled, and well qualified to serve on the Court.\"\nFollowing Judge Lewis's testimony that day, Senator Grassley noted that he found Judge Lewis's testimony on behalf of then-Judge Alito \"particularly compelling.\" So today, we hope that Senator Grassley will be similarly compelled by Judge Lewis's remarks. Otherwise, Senator Grassley's continued obstruction amounts to what former Judge Lewis today called \"dangerous political gamesmanship rooted in an unfortunate ideological fervor that ultimately harms each branch of government and dilutes the effectiveness and capacity of the judiciary.\"\nSo before today I had not had the pleasure of ever having heard of Judge Lewis, but presumably all of you have. But obviously he has some interesting things to say and he comes to this issue from a unique perspective. So I commend his testimony to your attention.\nSo with all that, we'll go straight to the birthday boy. Josh, you can begin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. It seems like you were having fun with that last windup.\nMR. EARNEST: I enjoyed reading about Judge Lewis's testimony today.\nQ: I wanted to start with Senator Pat Roberts's comments about the confirmation of Eric Fanning --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. We last discussed him when he was crumbling the Gitmo paper in his hands and filming himself throwing it into a wastebasket.\nQ: Well, he essentially suggested that there was a quid pro quo between him and the Defense Department that he agreed to lift this hold because he was told by Deputy Defense Secretary Work that the clock had run out on transferring people to Leavenworth or really to the mainland. I know that the Deputy Defense Secretary has put out his own statement despite this, but one thing he doesn't address in that statement is the specific language that Senator Roberts brought up about the clock has run out on being able to do this in the time that's left in this administration. So I'm wondering if you can -- is the White House disputing Senator Roberts's account of what he was told by the Defense Department about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into any -- I don't have any insight to share about private conversations between Senator Roberts and the Department of Justice. The good news is -- I'm sorry -- the Department of Defense. The good news is that the Department of Defense has explained exactly what was communicated to Senator Roberts. They were involved in those discussions, and they can make clear exactly what was communicated to him.\nThe thing that I can just confirm for you is that nothing about the administration's position, with regard to the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, has changed. We continue to believe that the most effective way to close the prison is to transfer all those individuals that can be safely transferred. We continue to work with our partners all around the world to do that in a way that is consistent with our national security.\nBut we also believe that it's possible to transfer the remaining detainees at the prison at Guantanamo Bay to the United States to secure facilities where those detainees can be held without posing a threat to our national security. After all -- and Senator Roberts knows this quite well -- that there are dangerous, convicted, hardened terrorists serving time on American soil, in American prisons, right now. That does not pose a threat to our national security. In fact, detaining them, having brought them to justice through our Article III courts, actually makes our country safer.\nSo our argument on this is quite clear. This is an argument that has strong bipartisan support among national security experts. President Bush agreed with this position. Both Colin Powell, General David Petraeus have also articulated their strong support for the priority that should be placed on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay explicitly for national security reasons.\nQ: I think the elephant in the room here is that even if Congress were to see the light, in your view, and embrace what you've described as the most effective, direct way to close the prison by lifting these restrictions, that would be effective at the start of the new fiscal year. So you basically have October, November, December and part of January to select a location, prepare a location, transfer dozens of detainees from Gitmo to the United States, and then close the prison. So are you able to acknowledge at this point that even if President Obama is able to order the closure of Guantanamo Bay, that he won't be able to actually, because of these logistical constraints, close it by the time he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't been presented with that conclusion. So we continue to believe that it is possible and, in fact, should be a priority of the United States government to succeed in closing that prison. And President Obama vowed to do it as soon as possible. He did that on I believe it was his second or third full day in office. And the President continues to strongly believe that that should be a priority and that that would be possible if our efforts to achieve this goal were not being thwarted by obstructionists in the United States Congress.\nQ: And I wanted to ask you about this dispute within the Democratic Party primary and some of the comments from Senator Sanders just in the last day, saying, in light of what happened in Nevada, the Democratic Party basically has a choice. It can open its doors, bring people in, or it can choose to be -- its status-quo structure remain dependent on big-money contributions and be a party with limited energy. And I'm wondering if you feel that, after seven and a half years of the Democratic Party being under the leadership of President Obama, if that's an accurate description of the way the party stands.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me make a couple of observations. The first is that I do feel confident -- though I did not specifically do this myself -- that if you were to Google news coverage from May 18th, 2008, the tenor of the coverage would be quite similar to the tenor of the coverage today. There would be all kinds of hand-wringing among party activists about whether or not the party would come together after a divisive primary between Senator Obama and Senator Clinton. There would be pundits with decades of electoral experience posing difficult questions about whether or not it is even possible given the passion of Clinton supporters for even somebody with all the skills of Senator Obama to unite the Democratic Party. There would be Republicans salivating at the prospect of a divided Democratic Party limping into a general election, giving an advantage to the Republican nominee.\nI guess the point is that we've seen a lot of this before. And that's not to diminish anybody's candidacy. It's not to diminish the passion and commitment of supporters for either candidate. But it is an indication that the Democratic Party in a general election will be focused on a different question. Americans across the country will be focused on a very clear choice that they'll have in a general election, and there will be ample time over the next six or seven months for candidates on either side to make their case. And President Obama will certainly be weighing in to make his case. And I think all of that will serve to motivate the American people to engage in this debate and to participate in the election.\nAnd President Obama and others will certainly be making that case. And I don't have too many doubts about the intensity of the debate that is likely to ensue or the degree to which voters on both sides and both parties will be highly motivated to participate. It's a good thing for our democracy. And President Obama had an opportunity to speak about this at the commencement ceremony at Rutgers University over the weekend. And the idea that our electorate gets more engaged in these kinds of political debates is good for the country.\nQ: The primaries are always hard-fought, I think we acknowledge. But this seems to be a different flavor here. I mean, we've got allegations of violence, of disenfranchisement; the DNC Chairwoman saying one of the candidate's campaigns is doing insufficient to address that. Does the President feel no obligation at this point to mediate or to try and resolve some of this? He's basically just going to wait until the candidates do that amongst themselves to get involved?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Josh, that we have seen that the party primaries typically are, particularly ones that are contested as passionately as this one has been. There are going to be strong feelings on both sides.\nBut I think one of the lessons of the election in 2008 is not to confuse the passion in the primary for disinterest in the general election. I think, if anything, the reason that people are so passionate about the current primary process is they understand the stakes in the general election. So that certainly was true in 2008. We'll see if it's true in 2016. But I'm confident that the President's engagement in the general election will be useful in sharpening up that case and he certainly looks forward to the opportunity to do it.\nBut I also think that President Obama benefits from his own personal involvement in the last hotly contested Democratic presidential primary; that yes, the issues are a little different and the debates are always a little bit different but no less intense. They certainly were intense, particularly in this period, in May of 2008. So there's probably an interesting story to be written there about sort of where things were at this stage eight years ago.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, Donald Trump said yesterday in an interview with Reuters that he would be willing to talk to North Korea's leader, and that if he were successful in winning the White House, that he would renegotiate the Paris climate deal. What's your reaction to the first? And on the second, should U.S. allies be concerned that the Paris deal is not as strong or as bulletproof as the President did say when he helped to create it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, on the question related to North Korea, the President has been -- has had a number of opportunities recently to make clear exactly what our position is there. The United States has worked effectively with the international community, including countries like Russia and China, to isolate North Korea because of their failure to abide by their international obligations when it comes to their nuclear program. And we have succeeded in ramping up that pressure and ramping up that isolation. It has not yet had the desired effect on the North Korean regime, but there's ample evidence to indicate that they are feeling that pressure.\nAnd what we have said is that that pressure can be relieved and the international community is prepared to engage with North Korea as soon as they make clear their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and ending the kind of provocative rhetoric and acts that are so destabilizing to the broader region. So we've been pretty clear about what the path out of this isolation is for the North Korean government. Thus far, they have declined to pursue it, but that's the strategy that we have laid out and it is a strategy that is consistent with the joint pursuit of our interests in that region of the world, where the United States stands by our allies in South Korea and stands by our allies in Japan and coordinates with China and Russia in pursuit of this goal.\nAs it relates to the Paris climate agreement, I would just note that it's more than 190 countries who signed on to this agreement, and each of them made specific commitments with regard to how they would reduce carbon pollution in their countries. This is an agreement that took years to negotiate. It is an agreement that was only possible because of the leadership of the United States -- this is something that Prime Minister Cameron mentioned at the news conference that he did with President Obama in London a couple of weeks ago.\nThis agreement was catalyzed when President Obama announced alongside President Xi in China that both China and the United States were prepared to make commitments to cut carbon pollution. The Republican talking point for years had been that it was folly for the United States to pursue an international climate agreement and to cut carbon pollution in the United States knowing that China was going to only pollute more. The truth is because of principled, effective diplomacy and the leadership of President Obama, we did reach an agreement where China agreed to cap their emissions and begin to bring them down.\nWhat's significant about that is not just the positive impact we anticipate that that will have on the climate and the positive impact it had on diplomacy in terms of bringing other countries to the table, it's also going to have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. We already know that Westinghouse, a fine American business, has committed to building four nuclear plants in China. I think that's a pretty good indication of -- a pretty clear example of how the world's commitment to a low-carbon future has a positive economic impact in the United States. The same is true of other countries -- I mean of other U.S. companies like General Electric that now have essentially a global market for renewable energy.\nAs other countries have made a commitment to cutting their carbon pollution, they have to look to renewable energy to power their economy. And the United States -- in part because of some of the historic investments that were made in this sector of the economy under President Obama's leadership, the United States is the leading edge of that industry. And a global commitment on the part of nations around the world to considering sources of renewable energy only creates good economic opportunities for American businesses and American workers.\nSo the completion of the Paris agreement is a testament to President Obama's leadership, the effectiveness of diplomacy, the positive impact it will have on the climate and the positive impact it will have on the U.S. economy.\nQ: But just to circle back to my questions, is the White House concerned that U.S. allies may view comments like this as a sign that this agreement is not as robust as the President said when he signed it? And on the North Korea topic --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just do that one first. I don't know that there's anybody that's losing sleep here at the White House about that. So, no, that's not a source of concern.\nQ: And on North Korea, the President, when he was a candidate in 2008, also suggested that he would talk to U.S. enemies. Does he consider it responsible or irresponsible for Donald Trump to be suggesting that about Kim Jong-un?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I'm going to weigh in at this point on the pronouncements or rhetoric of any of the candidates, particularly with regard to an issue like North Korea. But we certainly have made clear what our approach to that situation is, and it is rooted in the President's commitment to working closely with our allies and partners around the world to ramp up pressure on countries like North Korea.\nI should also note that President Obama, over the last several years, has also deployed additional military assets to the Asia Pacific region, some of them oriented specifically to counter North Korea's missile program. And because of those investments and because of those strategic decisions that the President made in close consultation with our military leaders, believes that we've got sufficient protections in place. But that certainly has not dampened our desire to work effectively with the international community to ramp up pressure on the North Koreans to get them to change course.\nQ: Briefly, on one other topic. The Vice President was unveiling the overtime -- details of the overtime rules that we've been expecting for some time. Is the White House confident that these will stand up to legal challenges from Republicans in the business community? And are you confident that they will stay in place if a Republican -- Donald Trump, in this case -- wins the White House in November?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the short answer to your question is yes. I will elaborate on it briefly. As it relates to sort of the legal questions, this is actually not the creation of a new rule. This is a rule that has been on the books governing overtime pay for decades now. So this is merely an update of an already-existing rule that will ensure that the hardest-working Americans are paid fairly for their overtime. So the principle is quite simple. The impact is quite significant. We would anticipate that this executive action that would extend overtime protections to more than 4 million American workers -- again, by definition, these are 4 million of the hardest-working Americans. These are individuals who are already working overtime. And the President believes that they should be paid fairly for their work. And the economic impact is also significant. The economic impact, according to our estimates, is that Americans' wages would increase by $12 billion over the next 10 years as a result of this rule. So this an impactful way for us to ensure that American workers are paid fairly, and to do something that many people have identified as an important goal, which is to put upward pressure on wages.\nWe've seen strong economic growth in this country. We've seen strong trends related to job creation. But we haven't seen as much progress made on increasing wages in this country. And this is a tangible example of how we can do that. And by the way, by definition, this is increasing wages for people who make $47,000 or less. So this is consistent with the President's strategy that our economy is going to be strongest when we're growing from the middle out and we're looking for opportunities to expand economic opportunity for middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get to the middle class.\nQ: The question is, can they withstand legal challenges?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, they can withstand legal challenges. Again, it's not a new rule. This is a rule that's been on the books for a long time. It's just merely updated with new standards. And the next President will have to make their own choices with regard to the way that they choose to use executive action. That's true on a whole range of things. But the legal foundation for making this argument is solid.\nJustin.\nQ: I want to start with Zika. Yesterday, the Senate did not pass the President's $1.9 billion request but did pass the $1.1 billion package. Stipulating everything that you've said many times before about public health experts wanting the full $1.9 billion, is the package that passed the Senate something that you guys would be willing to accept?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we are going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billion package. And we were pleased to see that that proposal, while it did not pass, did garner some important bipartisan support. So Republicans like Marco Rubio and even Bill Cassidy from Louisiana -- two states that are on the Gulf Coast that I think are legitimately concerned about the potential impact of the Zika virus on the populations in those two states -- supported the $1.9 billion package.\nAnd Senator Rubio, I think, said it in a way that I would strongly agree with for a change. He said, yes, the proposal came from the White House. But \"it's really the scientists' request, the doctors' request, the public health sector's request for how to address this issue.\" And he's right. The President put forward this proposal, but he did so based on the specific advice that he has received from our public health professionals. And we're going to continue to urge Congress to consider fully funding the request that our public health professionals have made.\nI'm no expert in math, but obviously the Senate proposal that was passed yesterday is larger than the House Republican proposal that's under consideration. So obviously we've seen just in the last couple of weeks important progress in the right direction. For a while we saw Republicans on Capitol Hill basically rejecting the need for this kind of funding, but now we've seen bipartisan legislation move through the Senate that would fund our efforts for more than a billion dollars.\nSo obviously that's good progress, but it falls short of what our public health professionals believe is necessary. And we're going to continue to advocate for what our public health professionals believe is necessary.\nQ: You said that you would veto the House bill, and so I'm wondering, I guess, does that veto threat stand for anything less than the $1.9 billion? Or is the $1.1 billion something that -- not exactly everything you want, but you're willing to take it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billion. And I don't have a veto threat to issue on the $1.1 billion. Our concerns about the Republican proposal in the House are many. It's not just that they are about $1.3 billion short of what our experts say is necessary. It also demands that that emergency funding be paid for by gutting investments in protecting the American people from the Ebola virus. So the approach that Republicans have advocated for in the House is wrong, it's unwise, and it is inconsistent with prioritizing the public health and wellbeing of the American people.\nQ: On Libya, I'm wondering if you have a timeline to share for the U.S. and its allies to secure the U.N. Security Council resolution that they want that would enable us to ship arms to the unity government there. And also, I know that you talked a little bit about how it would be designed to keep arms out of the hands of people that we don't want to have them in the region, but I'm wondering if you could just maybe talk more broadly about if there's any risk that an infusion of arms is going to heighten tension or kind of fuel additional conflict just by their mere presence there.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a timeline that has been set out for the passage of a resolution. You can check with my colleagues in Ambassador Power's office. They would have a better sense of the mechanics of all of this. But the broader question is, what can the international community do to support the government of national accord in Libya in their efforts to secure the country and combat the ISIL presence that we know is there. And how can we do all of that in a way that prevents the arms from falling into the wrong hands. Libya is a dangerous place, and there are a variety of factions that aren't shy about resorting to violence to try to get their way inside of Libya. So the prospect of further militarizing the situation is a prospect that must be carefully considered.\nBut what's also clear is that the government of national accord needs sufficient resources and equipment to get that situation under control. And so that's what our experts will be examining. And I recognize that they have to walk a fine line here, so it will be carefully considered. I don't know if there is a timeline. I don't think there will be any desire to rush it. But at the same time, further delays are only going to create more space for some of those armed factions that aren't shy about resorting to violence.\nSo this is a difficult situation. We've made tremendous progress, though, when you sort of consider where we were even three or four months ago. There was a lot of doubt about whether or not we were going to be able to bring about the kind of political consensus among a variety of opposition groups to even form a government. But the U.N. did a lot of important work. The United States played a leading role in facilitating these conversations and bringing the international community together behind them. And we do now have a government of national accord, and that government of national accord now is in Tripoli.\nSo we've made a lot of important progress that, frankly, a couple of months I don't think I even would have believed was possible. And so we need to look for ways to keep that momentum going. And one way to do that is to consider international support for their security efforts there.\nQ: And last one. House Republicans are saying today that classified administration reports provided to Congress over the last three years show that the administration knowingly approved for the transfer of Gitmo detainees to countries that were incapable of preventing them from returning to terrorism, and argue that administration officials have given misleading testimony about that. So I was wondering how you respond to that sort of request from Republicans to correct the record on this issue.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the record is quite clear about what President Obama has worked to do. When he took office in 2009, he instituted a new procedure for considering specific cases of individual Gitmo detainees. And that process included a review of individual case files to determine the best way to dispose of those cases. And what the idea has been is that, by carefully reviewing the individual cases, we can design the most effective way to prevent them from posing a threat to the United States or our allies.\nAnd this has been a rigorous process and it's been meticulous, and you'll recall that early in 2009 and 2010, it took a while to stand this process up and to move through all of the applications. But that process has paid significant dividends for our national security because it has allowed us to succeed in transferring 144 individuals since January of 2009. And what we know is that less than 5 percent of them, of those individuals, have been confirmed as reengaging in the fight; 95 percent of them aren't. And that's an indication of the ability that the United States has to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay in a way that mitigates the risk that is posed to the American people.\nSo this is a process that is rigorous, that sometimes is not just exhaustive, but exhausting, but it has demonstrated a track record of success. And the President believes that we would be even more successful if Congress weren't time and time again trying to throw sand in the gears of the process in a way that has only slowed down our efforts and made our efforts more difficult. And that's unfortunate. But our track record here is solid and it is one that the President is proud of. It's one that has bipartisan support in terms of pursuing a goal that Democrats and Republicans share, and that is the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. This is often shaped up as a fight between Democrats and Republicans, or Republicans on Capitol Hill in a Democratic administration. The truth is, the Republican administration supported closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nSo I did have a chance to take a look at the statement from the Speaker's office today, and there was a suggestion somehow that the Obama administration was prioritizing politics in this situation. Well, that's pretty rich. I don't think that General David Petraeus is prioritizing politics when he says we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I don't think that General Colin Powell is prioritizing politics when he suggests that we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I don't think Senator McCain is playing politics when he suggests that we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I don't think that Senator Graham of South Carolina is playing politics when suggests that we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I don't think that Senator Collins is playing politics when she says that it would be a good idea to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nYou know who is playing politics with this? The RNC, who says that they actually want to run ads against Democrats all across the country for wanting to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nSo we know what's going on here. And you have congressional Republicans that are cynically playing politics and playing on the fears of the American people in order to score some cheap political points. The truth is, the American people would be safer if we succeeded in closing the prison. And that's not just my assessment. That's the assessment of the United States Department of Defense. That's the assessment of the United States intelligence community. And that's the assessment of Democratic and Republican national security experts that for years have disagree with the approach of this Congress to prevent the closure of the prison.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. What's the White House's reaction to Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz filing a censure resolution against the IRS Commissioner today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that I saw that specific news. Obviously our views of the work of the IRS Commissioner are quite different than the views of congressional Republicans. The fact is that John Koskinen has assumed a very difficult task. And that task has been made only more difficult by the false accusations of Republicans and by the continued insistence of Republicans to cut the budget for the IRS. So we know that over the last five years or so -- yes, over the last five years that Congress has cut the IRS budget by a billion dollars. And as a result, we've seen wait times for customer service increase. It's had a not positive impact on enforcement. And then to have Republicans come back and say that he's not doing a very good job, it's not on the level. And if they spent half as much time trying to make sure that the IRS got the money that they needed to do their job as they do undermining the commissioner of the IRS, the American people would be better served.\nQ: And to follow up on the President's lunch yesterday with Jack Ma, can you give us any more details on what the two men talked about over lunch?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a readout of the lunch. As I mentioned yesterday, the President appeared at a forum in Malaysia with Mr. Ma around the APEC Summit, and after the forum, the President had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Ma and invited him to come to lunch at the White House next time he was in the area. So this is just a follow-up on that public discussion that they had had.\nObviously they've got -- as they discussed in the public forum, there are a number of common interests that they have, particularly as they relate to climate change and the international economy. So this is something that is of interest to President Obama and that's why he was interested to have lunch with him.\nQ: He's the richest man in Asia, and so I think a lot of us were wondering why that meeting wasn't put on the President's public schedule.\nMR. EARNEST: Because it was a private lunch. It's not uncommon for the President to have a private lunch with people that you might find notable. But obviously those are disclosed on the WAVES lists that are released regularly. That is a transparency step that no previous President has agreed to, and, in fact, the previous administration went to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the release of those lists. So I think our approach to transparency here is well-documented.\nJulie.\nQ: I wanted to just ask you about the raids that we're hearing are going to be coming in the next few weeks and months on the Central American migrants who have crossed the southern border. Quite a few immigration advocates as well as some Democratic members of Congress have expressed very deep concerns that some of the people affected here are women and children, many of them who are not afforded due process in these immigration proceedings when they cross the border but are being sent back to very dangerous conditions. One of them said today that the President's decision to conduct these raids and use this approach to these people was nothing more than a callous political calculation with real and grave humanitarian consequences. So what's your response, first of all, to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to correct so many misconceptions. The first is what the Department of Homeland Security has indicated is that the current operations are a continuation of operations that were announced back in January and in March. And these operations are being conducted consistent with the enforcement priorities that President Obama and Secretary Johnson laid out back in the fall of 2014. That is these operations are focused on convicted criminals and others who could pose a risk to local communities. The other enforcement priority are individuals that we've previously described as recent border-crossers -- individuals who have been apprehended crossing the border illegally since January 1st of 2014. Those are our enforcement priorities and these operations are being conducted consistent with them.\nNow, in addition to that, that's not the only criteria. Operations are only being conducted to enforce orders from immigration courts. So only individuals who have been given an order of removal are subject to these operations, and we'll make sure that these operations are only conducted after all pending claims for asylum or humanitarian relief have been exhausted. There is a firm commitment to due process and that's just an important principle of living in the United States of America, and it's certainly one that this government is committed to.\nThe last thing -- I guess the other one that I -- the other piece of information that I feel is important to share with you is that there is existing guidance that the DHS officers follow that avoids carrying out these operations in sensitive locations like schools or hospitals or places of worship. What's also true, though, is this is a nation of laws and we have to enforce the laws. We can do all of that consistent with due process, but I would also readily acknowledge that this whole process would be far more effective if Congress had followed through on comprehensive immigration reform legislation. There is no argument there. And that's why we continue to make that case that that's something Congress should do and it's why it is congressional Republicans who are ultimately responsible, because they were the ones who prevented House consideration of bipartisan legislation that had already passed the Senate that we know would have passed the House if a vote had been held. But it wasn't.\nSo the administration is committed to enforcing the law. The side benefit here is also this should send a pretty clear signal to everyone, particularly individuals who are considering having their children smuggled into the country, that that's\na really bad idea. It's a dangerous journey. There's all kinds of evidence to indicate that these human traffickers have bad intentions and subject people who have paid them to horrible dangers, that those who are trafficked end up often being victimized themselves. So this should send a very clear signal to everybody who might be contemplating this that the pitch being peddled by human traffickers that they can get their child into the United States and their child would be allowed to stay is false. That is not an available option. And given the dangers in making that journey, it is not something that parents should even consider for their kids.\nAnd that is a principle that is rooted in a desire to try to protect people in other countries who are in a pretty desperate situation. And there are a host of other investments that our country is committed to making in places like Honduras and El Salvador to try to address the root causes of this migration that we've seen over the last couple of years.\nQ: Does the President regard these people primarily as economic migrants, or as refugees? Because if the President regards them as refugees, the deterrence message that you just recited that is clearly the intent of some of the enforcement actions doesn't seem to apply.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the intent is to enforce the law. That is the primary intent. But, again, for those who may be considering entrusting themselves or the care of their children to human traffickers, this should be a very clear signal that the sales pitch from the human traffickers is a false one and it gives false hope to people who are in a desperate situation.\nWhat the administration has sought to do is to address some of the root causes of migration. There's been a $700 million investment that was appropriated by Congress a year or two ago that is being used to invest in the security situation in those countries. It's also being used to invest in economic development efforts in those countries to try to address some of those root causes.\nThere's also been a discussion that has been initiated by the State Department, working with the U.N., to try to establish a process where people with legitimate refugee claims can make them not in the United States or at the U.S. border, but rather in their home countries. That is another way that we can give people access to refugee protection without having to embark on a dangerous journey.\nSo we're thinking about this creatively in a lot of ways. But there is a principle that's at play here about enforcing the law, and it's one that the administration takes quite seriously.\nQ: Doesn't this undermine the President's call for European countries to take in the flood of Syrian refugees that they're facing at their borders? I mean, you're talking about refugees staying in their countries and going through the proceedings there instead of coming here. And we've seen the President speak pretty strongly about how it's the obligation of countries who are facing inflows like this to accept people who need to resettle. So how is that consistent?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it's difficult to compare these situations. But I think the situation that I've just described in terms of trying to give people with legitimate refugee claims a method of applying for that status without having to embark on a dangerous journey. So I think we've tried to address these root causes in Central America in a way that's just not possible in a place like Syria. So I think that's why it's so difficult to compare these two situations.\nI think what is true in both instances is that we do have to consider that the people that we're talking about are human beings and they should be afforded that kind of common decency, and afforded due process rights. And that's something that the Department of Homeland Security has indicated they're committed to, and that is an important part of this equation, that individuals who are targeted in these operations are only subject to them once they have been ordered removed from the country by an Immigration court. And they are only subject to these operations once they have exhausted all of their humanitarian claims. So there is a commitment to due process, but there's also a commitment to enforcing the law.\nRon.\nQ: On the Zika standoff, the administration still says it's a $1.9 billion request. That was from like January 25th or so that you got the document that you often show us.\nMR. EARNEST: It was technically February 22nd.\nQ: Oh, I'm sorry. The question is, now that the Senate has taken some action, is there someplace where the administration is willing to compromise on that position you've held to for so long, given the public health urgency of this matter, as you clearly outlined it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, when we talk about compromise, at least the way that you have set it up, it contemplates not giving our public health professionals everything that they say that they need so that they can do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. So it shouldn't have to come to that, I guess is my point. If our goal here is to protect the public health and well-being of the American people, if that is our top priority, then why wouldn't we just do what our public health professionals suggest and pass the kind of proposal that they have said encapsulates the need?\nQ: But the reality is that the country is mired in political gridlock and things don't get done, and here's an example where apparently the public health is at risk because there's little compromise on both sides. So, yes, the same question for the other side, but is this --\nMR. EARNEST: I just reject that, Ron. This is not about the administration not being willing to compromise. This is the specific request that was put forward by public health experts. They've been very clear about what is necessary. And the only thing that Republicans in the House have come forward on is funding at like a third of the level that our public health experts recommend but taking every single penny of that money away from efforts to protect the American people from Ebola. So that doesn't make sense at all. That is a dumb approach. And I don't really understand why one would even consider an approach like that.\nQ: A compromise that protects the interests of public health --\nMR. EARNEST: Like gutting our funding to protect the American people from the Ebola virus?\nQ: \"Gutting\" is not the word I'd use. I'm saying --\nMR. EARNEST: That's the word that our public health professionals would use. I just went through this yesterday. There are 100 staff at the CDC -- 100 CDC staffers, government employees, that right now, as we speak, are in West Africa, processing 10,000 samples a month to try to fight the Ebola virus. And Republicans are saying we should just gut funding for that. I don't think there's any reason -- I don't think there would be any justification for gutting funding for that just to -- as somebody who stood up here in the fall of 2014 and explained what our government was doing to try to protect people from a deadly virus. But to say that we're going to gut funding for that because that's the only way that we can pay to protect the American people from anther dangerous virus that could potentially infect pregnant women and their babies -- that doesn't make sense.\nSo this doesn't have anything to do -- there are lots of things where Democrats and Republicans need to just try to sit down and compromise, and maybe they relate to things like taxes or the appropriate size of government, or maybe even our approach to dealing with education reform or job training, or something. That is something that should be subject to the political process where there is debate, where there's advocacy, where there's bargaining and then ultimately common ground where we can advance something that represents a compromise. When it comes to the public health and safety of the American people, there should be no compromising.\nQ: On the issue of the TSA lines that we talked about yesterday, there have been a number of senators, Democrats, who have asked for the airlines to suspend or compromise -- or change, or compromise, again -- (laughter) -- to suspend their baggage fees to move the process along. Is that something that the administration supports?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the individual business decisions of the airlines is up to them. Frankly, the airlines and industry experts can speak to what impact that would have on lines at the airports. There are a number of steps that TSA has taken to try to address this serious problem, and it does relate directly to the need to ensure that we are protecting our aviation system, but also trying to minimize inconvenience for travelers. And that's something that the TSA takes quite seriously and they're working through some creative solutions to try to reduce those lines without compromising safety.\nQ: Does the President still have confidence in the Administrator, Peter Neffenger?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. And we've seen, like I said, some creative steps that TSA has taken. They have sought additional authority to use more resources to pay overtime so that TSA officers can work longer hours and work more, spend more time process passengers. There's this other solution they have floated, which is getting more airport personnel that don't have security functions to help expedite the process through security so that those security screeners that typically remind people to take off their belts or to fill the bin can actually be used to do screening, and it can be airport staffers that can help people navigate the security line.\nSo there are a number of things that we can do to expand our capacity and try to shorten those lines. But, look, this is a tough problem and the President absolutely has confidence that Mr. Neffenger can solve this problem.\nQ: So obviously the summer travel season is coming. Given there's a problem, given there are staffing shortages, given there's this 10-point plan, can travelers reasonably expect that the situation is going to get better in the next couple of months? And if not, who is going to be held accountable?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the TSA has indicated they expect the situation will improve as some of the staffing increases that they have authorized start to have an impact on individual airports. The other thing that TSA is encouraging people to do is to apply for pre-check. If you're a frequent traveler, you can get a background check in advance so that the security screening that you have to go through is different. That presumably would make it possible for you to go through a shorter line. But that's also going to have the effect of shortening the line for everybody else. So we certainly want people to be aware of that.\nAnd we do anticipate, again, based on the solutions that TSA has been working to implement, I know that TSA has said that they expect that the situation should improve in the weeks and months ahead.\nQ: Two last housekeeping things. Before the President's upcoming trip, is there going to be a more detailed briefing or backgrounder about what exactly -- the goals, objective, timetables?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, we will have some more details about the President's trip before he departs on Saturday. We're still working on putting together a plan for doing that, but we'll be in touch with you on that. But that's something you can certainly look for before the trip.\nQ: You will obviously do it before that.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. Okay. But we can coordinate later and see if we can sync up our schedules.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to the conversation about Gitmo and Senator Roberts.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Were you saying it's simply a false claim by him that the administration struck a deal to not transfer prisoners?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm saying I can't account for the substance of private conversations that Senator Roberts had with the Department of Defense. And I recognize that that might be somewhat unsatisfying. The good news is, is that the Department of Defense official who had that conversation with Senator Roberts has put out a statement making very clear exactly what was communicated to Senator Roberts. So I'd refer you to that statement so he can walk you through it.\nQ: The Deputy Secretary of Defense -- I have that statement -- but it basically says all options are on the table, but we're running out of time to make a decision. So it's not really a conclusive statement there. I mean, what you're saying is that you don't stand by -- if there was a promise in private conversation, that's not the administration's position to promise and close off Kansas as a possible site.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into the private conversations that Senator Roberts had. I'm not privy to them. I wasn't on the phone. I haven't been briefed on those private conversations. What I can explain to you is the position that the administration has taken with regard to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Our position hasn't changed. And it's the same position that is strongly supported by a large bipartisan group of national security experts, including people who've dedicated their lives to protecting this country, like General Powell and General Petraeus.\nQ: Right, but no decisions have been made on where these prisoners would be transferred beyond the proposal as it was sent and approved by the White House to the Hill.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. We can't make that decision as long as Congress is preventing the transfer of any Gitmo detainees anywhere to American soil. And that is a ridiculous policy because the truth of the matter is there are already hardened convicted terrorists serving time in American prisons on American soil right now. People like Richard Reid, the infamous shoe bomber. You've got Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square. You've got Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit. All of these are individuals who went through the court system in the United States; they were convicted of their crimes and they are currently serving time in American prisons on American soil.\nWe know how to protect the country using our Article III courts and using the American prison system.\nQ: Then anyone on the Hill who has a belief that sites have been ruled out is simply misunderstanding the administration's position?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't understand much of what Republicans say when they advocate on this issue, so all I can do is try to explain as clearly as I possibly can exactly what our approach is. And the good news is that the approach that we have been pursuing for the last several years is the same approach that we are pursuing today.\nQ: And we're no closer?\nMR. EARNEST: Unfortunately, not. Unfortunately, we continue to see obstacles that members of Congress have put in place.\nQ: Can I ask you on Nigeria, first? There were reports today the Nigerian military was claiming that they did find one of the so-called Chibok girls, one of the schoolgirls that was taken by Boko Haram. Hundreds of them disappeared. The admin at the time had been very vocal in calling for their return. Do you have any comment on this, or confirmation? Have you seen these reports?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen those reports, but let me see if we can get you some more information on that.\nQ: And can you clarify whether the administration has made a decision on whether it is willing to sell certain weapons to the current President Buhari of Nigeria?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some reporting speculating about this. I'm not aware of any decision that's been made, but we can follow up with you on that as well.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You made some comparisons to this campaign season and 2008. And, yeah, there are some similarities, absolutely, but there are also enormous differences. And in this case, you have a socialist running against a former Secretary of State. You have debate over what the party should stand for, what being a progressive even means. And we just heard Senator Feinstein say that she's worried that if Sanders stays in the race past June, you could see something like what happened in the 1968 convention. So that's kind of the comparison she's using. Do you think that's off the mark to be worried about a risk like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that right now that's not something that we're concerned about. Again, this has been a vigorous primary contest, and that ultimately has had the effect of mobilizing millions of Americans across the country who have gotten engaged in democratic politics and gotten engaged in the process of choosing the Democratic nominee. That's good for America. That's good for our democracy. I also happen to think that's probably pretty good for the Democratic Party. And in 2008, that process and that engagement across the country ended up being a harbinger of Democratic success in the future, in the general election. Hopefully, that will be true this time, too.\nQ: But she's worried about the party being harmed if he stays in much longer. And the President himself not too long ago, at a private event, expressed concerns about party unity and it being about time for people to be behind one candidate. So do you not share her views that this could be detrimental to the Democratic Party much longer?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think at this point, no, I don't share those concerns. Obviously, there will be a need for Democrats to come together in the general election, and the President will be making that case. But right now we're still probably not in the middle of -- I think probably nearing the end of a nationwide, competitive Democratic primary process that has engaged the American people from coast to coast. That's a good thing, and that kind of competition makes the candidates and makes the parties and makes our democracy stronger. That's a good thing.\nQ: And maybe it's just about this one incident that happened most recently. But now there's a lot of talk about the threat of violence, and what Dianne Feinstein just said fits in with that, as well. But you're not concerned about violence moving forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't think -- no, because --\nQ: Of riots, like in 1968 or something?\nMR. EARNEST: No, that's not something that we're concerned about.\nQ: Okay, great. And you mentioned yesterday, on the 9/11 legislation, that there was going to be some outreach now with the House. Can you describe a little bit what that will look like? And will the President himself get involved in that outreach?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any presidential conversations that have occurred at least in the last couple of days on this. I think what that outreach will look like is the White House seeking to engage Democrats and Republicans who have expressed public concern about this legislation. So there are a number of people that have indicated that they share our concerns with this bill, and we'll work closely with them to try to prevent a legislative outcome that puts the United States at greater risk around the world. We don't need to put our interests or our assets or our diplomats or our servicemembers at greater risk. And that is a potential unintended consequence of the legislation as currently drafted and passed by the Senate.\nQ: So are those conversations going to start soon, or now?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you generally that the White House has already been in touch with members of the House of the Representatives about this. I don't know that those conversations have occurred at the presidential level at this point, but I wouldn't rule that out.\nKaren, nice to see you.\nQ: Thank you. Nice to see you. There's a report out from MapLight. It's an organization that tracks money in politics. And it found that 15 of the 39 main donors to the Obama Foundation have been invited to meetings here at the White House with the President, and one of those meetings was in January of 2015, and there were two couples who had donated six figures, as well as the actress Julia Roberts was at that meeting. The report also found that three-quarters of the contributors to the foundation that have been disclosed have been invited to the White House, including every donor that's kicked in more than $100,000. Can you comment on this report? And are these meetings here at the White House, especially the ones with the President, are they specifically meant to raise money for the foundation?\nMR. EARNEST: They are not. The President has made a commitment that he will not be raising money for the foundation while he's still in office. What we have said about donors to the campaign also applies to donors at the foundation, and it's simply this: Donating in support of the President's foundation does not guarantee you a meeting with the President of the United States. It also doesn't prevent you from getting a meeting with the President of the United States, and that's the approach that we've taken, again, with regard to supporters of the President's campaign, and it's the approach that we've taken with regard to supporters of the President's foundation.\nQ: And one more. The Director of National Intelligence this morning, James Clapper, said that there's been indication of attempted hacks on campaign websites and campaign organizations. Can you expand on what those indications are and how severe they might have been?\nMR. EARNEST: Unfortunately, Director Clapper was talking about intelligence information. And as the Director of National Intelligence, he's got greater latitude to discuss that information -- well, at least greater latitude than I do. So I don't have anything I can say about that.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You mentioned earlier the need to apply upward pressure on wages. I'm curious, as it relates to the overtime rule, how concerned is the White House on the economic pressure on small business in particular as they have to take on obviously more salaries and make shifts -- sometimes major structural shifts -- to accommodate the new, or as you put it, revised, regulations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the approach that we have taken is one that is consistent with the need to focus on fairness. Again, we're talking about people who are the hardest-working Americans. These are individuals who, by definition, they're working overtime, and they should be treated fairly. And that should be good for business. And our view is that employers have had ample time to consider these changes. This is something that has been in the works for more than two years. There were extensive comments that were put forward. I believe it's more than 270,000 comments were received on the rule -- some people advocating for a higher threshold, some people advocating for a lower threshold. And we've taken into account those comments in designing this rule. And we expect that this will have a positive impact on the economy. We anticipate this will have a positive impact on wages. And we believe that ultimately this will be good for business as well.\nQ: Good for business in what way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, good for business in that they can ensure that their workers are being paid fairly. And it also, again, is going to put upward pressure on wages. Henry Ford, who at one point made a decision to raise the pay of his workers so he could make sure that the people who are working to build the cars could afford to buy them. So, ultimately, if you're looking to strengthen the economy, putting more money in the pocket of middle-class workers and those workers that are trying to get into the middle class is a good thing. And here's the thing, in this situation it's not charity. In this situation, it's about fairness. In this situation, it's about making sure that people are being fairly compensated for their overtime. These are the hardest -- these are by definition the hardest-working Americans. That's what we'd like to see. We believe that will be good for the economy overall, and a good economy is good for business.\nQ: Interesting bit in Politico. Would you acknowledge that there is a bit of a race against the clock to try to beat the 23rd so that Donald Trump doesn't have a chance, were he to be elected, to sort of undo some of these regulations that the President is sort of trying to push through?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is a rule that's been --\nQ: This is a revision, I understand.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's a revision but it's also a rule that's been in the works for more than two years. So if we were rushing this rule through, we didn't do a very good job of rushing because it took more than two years to get it right. What is true -- and this is something I guess I acknowledged in response to an earlier question -- obviously the next President will also have executive authority that they can wield and presumably they can make changes to this threshold as well. We obviously hope that they won't, but this is an executive action and is consistent with what the President believes is a smart strategy to try to grow our economy from the middle out and focus on expanding economic opportunity for middle-class workers and those workers that are trying to get into the middle class.\nQ: Why Ohio?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously it is a place where these kinds of issues related to middle-class workers really resonates. Senator Brown, who is hosting both the Vice President and Secretary Perez, has been a leading advocate for this change. And they are going to an Ohio business where many workers, many employees of that business will benefit from it and the people who run that business think that's going to end up being good for the overall economy and good for their business prospects.\nQ: You see what I'm getting at. It could have been Wyoming, but it's Ohio.\nMR. EARNEST: It could have been. I don't believe the two senators from Wyoming have been particularly aggressive advocates of the overtime rule.\nQ: The old politics is what I'm getting at. There's no real sort of, hey, listen, November -- Ohio is such a keystone state as it relates to -- with respect to my friends in Pennsylvania -- it's a major state, obviously, politically speaking. There's got to be a little bit of that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, Senator Brown is not on the ballot this time, at least not yet. It was a joke. I have no idea. Come on. I'm just trying to get a little -- boost his prospects here. But, look, Senator Brown is not on the ballot but he is somebody who has aggressively advocated for this rule. He is somebody who has urged the administration to raise this threshold and it's because he is somebody who has rightly earned the reputation as somebody who is committed to fighting for American workers and he is as interested as the administration is in making sure that people are paid fairly, particularly middle-class families.\nQ: A couple more. Westinghouse. You mentioned -- I just -- it sort of piqued my interest. They're building I guess new nuclear facilities over in China, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Mm-hmm.\nQ: Are they building any here? Is the President getting them to do sort of that clean energy work here that might employ Americans? It's been decades since we've had a major reactor built in the States.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there is one that is going through the permitting process that began early in the President's administration. I'm not sure what the -- I haven't gotten a briefing on the latest status of what that is. But what we certainly have seen here though is a dramatic growth in renewable energy because of some of the policy decisions that President Obama has made. Since President Obama took office, we've seen that wind energy has tripled and the amount of energy that is produced from solar has increased thirtyfold since President Obama took office. That is a result of investments that were made early on.\nThe Recovery Act included the largest-ever investment in renewable energy, and it's already starting to pay dividends, both in terms of reducing our carbon footprint, but also in terms of business opportunities that are good for our broader economic growth but also good for job creation. And so you've got Westinghouse that's building nuclear plants in China because China is looking for ways that they can reduce their carbon footprint. That's good for economic growth back here in the United States because that's a good American company. But we have also seen a wide variety of American companies building wind turbines and installing solar panels, which has the same positive economic impact on this country too.\nQ: Last one. I want to give you another run at the comparison between people who are coming over our borders -- often illegally, unfortunately -- and refugees in Europe. They both -- it would appear, at least from the outside -- are attempting to escape devastating circumstances, and I'm trying to understand or square the difference from a policy perspective from the White House's viewpoint, because they both would seem to be in desperate need of our help -- whether they're in Europe and you're calling on other European countries to reach out and help them.\nI know that you talked about -- I think you said 10,000 was originally the number in terms of refugees, and I just sort of look at that number and I say, good, that we should probably, from a policy perspective, if the President wants to make that argument, good, make that argument. But you can't make that argument I think (inaudible) and at the same time say, yeah, but we don't want to help these people. Does that make sense?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can understand why people might be confused and here's the -- the commitment that we've made with regard to refugees is actually, for this fiscal year, I believe it is around 80,000. We can get you the precise number. It's just 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year but about 80,000 overall.\nNow, that could potentially include refugees from Central America but that would require them to go through the rigorous process that has been established. And this is a process that includes intense background checks. It's also a process that includes a careful vetting of their background to determine whether or not they qualify for refugee status. And what we have sought to do is to make it easier for individuals in a handful of Central American countries to apply for that status without even leaving their country. And the idea is that that would give them the opportunity to be considered for some form of humanitarian relief or refugee status that would allow them to travel legally into the United States after having their background carefully vetted without having to risk the dangerous journey through Mexico, sometimes in the hands of a human smuggler to try to get here.\nA process like that doesn't exist in Syria because nobody -- or hardly anybody in the international community is able to work with the central government there, and the central government has demonstrated that they have no ability to control a security situation in that country. The situation in a place like El Salvador or Honduras is also difficult and there are people who face terrible life circumstances in that country, too. But at least we have a central government there with whom the United States can work to try to address that situation. So we have provided them substantial resources to try to deal with the security situation there, to try to deal with economic development in those countries that is lacking.\nSo at least there's something to work with, something to build on when you're considering a place like El Salvador or Honduras. That kind of platform doesn't currently exist in Syria right now, and that's one of the reasons -- this is sort of a creative way to make an argument that we've been making for a couple of years now, which is that the only way that we are really going to solve the problem of Syria is with a political solution where we see a political transition that has President Assad leaving power and somebody else coming into power in Syria that bears the legitimacy of the Syrian people. And then the rest of the international community can work with that person and that person's government to try to bring in the foundation that will start to rebuild that country and give people who have been threatened there a reason to feel like they can remain home and not be the victim of violence.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, can I just clarify something? You said recently that no federal funds would be cut off to North Carolina while the legal process was ongoing over their transgender bill. Is the agency review still going on? And if so, is it possible that they could come out with at least a finding?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I can't speak to the work that's going on at individual agencies. Presumably, there might be some consideration of the impact of HB2 on the policies of the federal government. So that consideration may be ongoing. I think you'd probably have to check with each individual agency on this. But what I can tell you is that no action will be taken to block funding as long as the Department of Justice litigation is moving through the courts.\nQ: So what were the agencies? Education and --\nMR. EARNEST: So I think there were a number of agencies that have undertaken these kinds of reviews, but the most prominent ones have been Education, Transportation. I believe HHS and the Department of Labor have also considered whether or not this law would have an impact on federally funded programs in North Carolina. I think those are the most prominent ones, but we can take a look at this and see if we can get you some other suggestions of agencies to contact.\nQ: Okay. And just briefly, have you gotten any complaints or concerns or protests from veterans' groups over the President's stop in Hiroshima?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm always trepidacious about giving you this answer, because presumably, somebody in this country of 300 million people doesn't support this decision.\nBut what I can tell you is that the overwhelming response that the administration has gotten has been either positive or at least sympathetic to what the President is trying to do. And I think that's true of even those who fought in World War II. Again, this is the \"Greatest Generation\" of Americans. That generation will go down in history for saving the United States and the world from tyranny. They sacrificed greatly. But I think even many of those veterans would acknowledge that the relationship between the United States and Japan has, before their eyes, been radically transformed. And the United States and Japan are now able to cooperate on a wide range of issues, some of which have direct implications for U.S. national security.\nAnd the ability of our nations to cooperate and to coordinate, and to strengthen our alliance, is good for the United States and bodes well for the future. And I think there's a large portion of even World War II veterans who may have risked their lives fighting Japanese soldiers in World War II who understand the potential that exists, and understands the argument that the President has made.\nI will acknowledge I'm not sure if I'd feel the same way if I were them. I think in their -- as they think about their service to the country, I think that demonstrates a profound depth of selflessness. But I think that's the kind of courage and patriotism that many of those Americans showed on the battlefield, and many of them are showing it now -- here we are, seven decades later -- even as they inhabit their role as citizen.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said earlier there's a lot of passion in any primary process, but it seems to me that we're a little bit beyond that. A lot of Sanders supporters seem to believe that the primary process is rigged against him, and the integrity of the entire nominating process is being questioned. The Nevada situation aside, broadly speaking, does the President believe the rules the Democratic Party has laid out from the beginning are being followed and have been fair?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't closely examined the rules. I can say that the White House believes in the integrity of the Democratic National Committee and their commitment to the fair implementation of the rules.\nAnd I know that they're working with state parties all across the country to implement their delegate selection plans to ensure that there is a fair and transparent process for choosing state delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\nThe other thing, though, as you were asking, that occurs to me that I think sort of helps to put in rather stark relief the intensity of the campaign in 2008 and the impact that that could have had on the general election in 2008 -- there were not an insignificant number of Democrats in May of 2008 who were saying publicly that they were prepared to organize and raise money in support of the Republican presidential candidate. There was a lot of questions about whether or not there would be an aggressive \"Democrats for McCain\" movement that would tip the balance of the election.\nFor all of the passion and ferocity and competitiveness of the Democratic primary in 2016, I haven't read too many public accounts of that happening in this general election.\nQ: Switching topics, a House committee passed a bill yesterday that would stop the District of Columbia from spending its own tax dollars without congressional approval. If this were to pass the full House and the Senate, would the President veto it?\nMR. EARNEST: I have seen some of the reporting about this. I know that there is a -- not coincidentally, I assume -- a prominent story in The Washington Post about this. I don't yet know that our team has had a chance to consider carefully the impact of the legislation. It's still working its way through the legislative process; obviously it's just passed through the committee. So we'll take a look at that proposal and get back to you in terms of a position.\nJC.\nQ: Just to follow up on Pam Coulter's question. Will there be both United States and Japanese veterans attending the service at Hiroshima?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if there will be U.S. veterans there, but as we get closer to locking down the details of the trip, we'll keep you posted.\nTom.\nQ: I just have a follow-up on the D.C. question. In 2003, the measure that the House Republicans were trying to block with the support of Speaker Ryan was endorsed by President Obama. So that's why it's -- I'm wondering if the White House would have a reaction.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me dig into this and I'll make sure that we follow up with you on this as well. I'm just not familiar with the details of this particular bill. There's still an opportunity, obviously, to have an impact on what it would do as it works its way through the legislative process. But let me see if I can get you a specific position on it.\nDave, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Since you came out to the podium, about a half hour ago, AP is reporting that Donald Trump has released his list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees that he plans to vet. I'm sorry you haven't seen the list, but it includes Steven Colloton of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Allison Eid of the Colorado Supreme Court; Thomas Hardiman of the 3rd Circuit; and William Pryor of the 11th Circuit. Obviously that's not the whole list, but do any of those names sound familiar to you from your previous vettings?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think that we've ever gotten into people that the --\nQ: There's always a first time.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, exactly, there is always a first time. Let me make this observation. I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would describe any of those 11 individuals as a consensus nominee. But the individual that President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. And I think that speaks to the wisdom of the Senate acting on the President's nomination, and I think it speaks to the President's commitment to fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in a way that is consistent with his desire to protect the Supreme Court from the kind of partisan wars that it's been subjected to of late.\nQ: I know the President -- you've said the President feels very strongly that Trump will not be the next President, but he is about to become the major party nominee. Can you give us a thumbnail sketch of what you think a Supreme Court that's populated by Trump nominees, what direction that would take the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll leave that to others to speculate what Mr. Trump would do as President of the United States. My responsibility here is to forcefully advocate for what the President has done and what he is going to do over the eight months that he has remaining in office. And there's a lot we've got to get done.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:34 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-05-18", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118144", "text": "The threat of wildfire is increasing in the United States. In 2015, over 68,000 wildfires in the United States burned more than 4,636 structures and ten million acres—the highest number of acres burned on record. The annual estimates on structure loss due to wildfire have increased dramatically for more than six decades.\nAlong with temperature, wildfires are determined by a variety of factors, including precipitation. A hotter, drier climate has a major effect on wildfire generation. As stated in the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment, increased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, all caused by or linked to climate change, have increased wildfires, especially in the western U.S. Fire models project more wildfire and increased risks to communities across extensive areas in the future. Given strong relationships between climate and fire, even when modified by land use and management, including fuel treatments, projected climate changes suggest that western forests in the United States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur more frequently.\nSince 1990, 60 percent of new homes nationally have been built in areas known as the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where houses, structures and people reside adjacent to or within wildlands and are therefore at risk of structure loss, injury, and death from wildfire. Federal departments and agencies have an estimated 6,256 buildings in WUI locations.\nTo better combat these fire risks, we need to increase our understanding of how wildfires interact with communities in terms of structures, terrain, and weather. Together, we must take action to enhance community resilience against these risks.\nToday, the White House, in collaboration with the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, is hosting a roundtable to discuss wildfire mitigation and firefighter safety, and to identify further policy actions needed to enhance community resilience within the WUI. Senior Federal agency officials; State, local, and tribal government leaders; and representatives of national organizations dedicated to firefighter safety and to community resilience will participate. At the roundtable, the following announcements will be made:\nExecutive Order for Enhanced Wildfire Risk Mitigation in the Wildland-Urban Interface\nPresident Obama today signed an Executive Order on Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation, which will mitigate wildfire risks to Federal buildings located in the WUI, reduce risks to people, and help minimize property loss to wildfire. For new buildings and alterations to existing buildings greater than 5,000 square feet on Federal land within the WUI at moderate or greater risk to wildfire, the Executive Order directs Federal agencies to apply wildfire-resistant design provisions delineated in the 2015 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or an equivalent code. These codes, which encompass the current understanding of wildfire hazard potential, will help increase safety and protect the lives of people who live or work in these buildings.\nCommitment Statement\nFederal, State, local, tribal and non-Government leaders from over 39 agencies and jurisdictions have committed to a multi-scale, collaborative approach to address the challenges posed by wildfire in wildland-urban interface and to the following statement:\nAs Federal, State, local, tribal and non-Government leaders, we recognize the challenges of managing fire in the wildland-urban interface, including the increased complexity of fire response, air quality and public health impacts, and loss of community infrastructure and cultural resources. The consequences of a changing climate intensify these challenges, resulting in more severe wildfires threatening the well-being of our communities, and jeopardizing the safety of our first responders and the public they serve.\nWe are committed to safely and effectively extinguishing fire, when needed; using fire where allowable; managing our natural resources; and as a Nation, living with wildland fire safely. We are committed to advancing community resilience in the wildland-urban interface, managing the adjacent landscapes wisely, and continuing to improve the efficiency of wildland fire response. We are committed to a multi-scale, collaborative approach to address the challenges posed by wildfire in the wildland-urban interface.\nBuilding Resilience and Sustainability\nThe effort to mitigate wildfire risk to Federal facilities is part of a broader set of initiatives to build resilience throughout the Federal government, with State, local, and tribal leaders, and with non-governmental partners. Recent Federal resilience initiatives have focused on flood risk management, seismic early warning, long-term drought resilience, advocating for climate-smart building codes and standards, and a number of technical assistance programs to partner with communities to enhance sustainability and resilience. Together with Federal sustainability initiatives to promote clean energy and lower greenhouse gas emissions across the Federal family, these actions help prepare us for those climate impacts that are too late to avoid.", "timestamp": "2016-05-18", "title": "Fact Sheet: Mitigating the Risk of Wildfires in the Wildland-Urban Interface"}

Because of the persistent efforts of researchers, advocates, and so many others in the medical and public health communities, we have made great strides in advancing treatment of and finding cures for viral hepatitis. Individuals living with hepatitis B and C can only benefit from these advances if they are tested and made aware of their disease. On National Hepatitis Testing Day, we reaffirm the importance of educating people about viral hepatitis, and we encourage individuals at risk for hepatitis B and hepatitis C to get tested.\nMore than half of Americans living with viral hepatitis are unaware of their infection status. This lack of awareness contributes to an increasing number of infections and deaths that could be prevented by people receiving the care and treatment they need. When left undiagnosed and untreated, viral hepatitis can cause serious damage to the liver—it is the leading cause of liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation. Symptoms of viral hepatitis can go undetected for many years, which is why it is important to receive vaccines for hepatitis A and B, and blood tests for hepatitis B and C—measures that can be life-saving for those living with this disease. I urge all Americans to visit www.CDC.gov/Hepatitis for more information.\nPrevention and early detection are key to combating viral hepatitis, and my Administration remains dedicated to ensuring all Americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve. The Affordable Care Act requires coverage of recommended services that can help prevent, detect, and treat viral hepatitis—including viral hepatitis vaccinations and testing. In addition, the Act prohibits insurers from denying coverage to anyone with a preexisting condition, like viral hepatitis. We have also released a roadmap for ensuring our Federal efforts to address viral hepatitis are coordinated and focused on making more people living with viral hepatitis aware of their status. The Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, available at www.HHS.gov/Hepatitis, spans more than 20 Federal entities and it moves us toward increasing the number of people who are aware of their infection status, reducing the number of new cases of hepatitis C, and eliminating the transmission of hepatitis B between mother and child.\nI have proposed funding to support a new initiative aimed at expanding testing and access to treatment of hepatitis C for people living with HIV and to advance efforts to eliminate hepatitis C transmission and deaths. Those living with HIV are more vulnerable to viral hepatitis infections, and African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians and Alaska Natives are also disproportionately affected. Viral hepatitis infections, particularly among young people, can be reduced by addressing the heroin epidemic and abuse of prescription opioids—a priority for my Administration—and by ensuring that individuals who inject drugs have access to treatment services for HIV, viral hepatitis, and substance use disorders. We have taken action to expand access to treatment and increase community prevention strategies so more Americans can get the help they need. On this day, let us rededicate ourselves to ensuring all people with viral hepatitis know their infection status and have access to necessary care and resources. Let us honor those we have lost too soon, and let us recognize the many individuals working tirelessly to address this disease, develop treatments, and save lives.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19, 2016, as National Hepatitis Testing Day. I encourage citizens, Government agencies, non-profit organizations, and communities across the Nation to join in activities that will increase awareness about viral hepatitis and the need for expanded testing.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-18", "title": "Proclamation 9450—National Hepatitis Testing Day, 2016"}

Policy. It is the policy of the United States to strengthen the security and resilience of the Nation against the impacts of wildfire. The annual estimates on structure loss due to wildfire have increased dramatically over the past six decades as a result of multi-year drought conditions in combination with accumulated fuel loads, growing populations residing in the wildland-urban interface, and associated increases in the exposure of built environments. As such, we must continue to ensure our Nation is resilient to wildfire in order to promote public safety, economic strength, and national security.\nThe Federal Government must continue to take proactive steps to enhance the resilience of buildings that are owned by the Federal Government and are located on Federal land. Each executive department and agency (agency) responsible for implementing this order shall seek to enhance the resilience of its buildings when making investment decisions to ensure continued performance of essential functions and to reduce risks to its buildings' occupants in the event of a wildfire.\nSec. 2. Codes and Concurrent Requirements. (a) Commencing within 90 days of the completion of the implementing guidelines as described in section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency shall ensure that every new Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with the 2015 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If a determination is made that a new version is a nationally recognized code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with that new version, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312.\n(b) Commencing within 90 days of the completion of the implementing guidelines as described in section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency responsible for the alteration of an existing Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk for which the agency has not completed design shall ensure that the alteration is effectuated in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If a determination is made that a new version is a nationally recognized code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with that new version, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312.\n(c) Each agency that owns an existing Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk is strongly encouraged to ensure that such existing buildings are in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code.\n(d) The heads of agencies whose activities are covered by sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order shall complete a wildfire risk assessment of their existing Federal buildings above 5,000 gross square feet within the wildland-urban interface and are strongly encouraged to consider creating and maintaining a defensible space in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, for each of those buildings they determine to be at highest risk.\n(e) Each agency that leases space in a building to be constructed for the predominant use of an agency above 5,000 rentable square feet in the wildland-urban interface in an area of greater than moderate wildfire risk is strongly encouraged to ensure that the building is designed and constructed in accord with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code.\n(f) Each agency assisting in the financing, through Federal grants or loans, or guaranteeing the financing, through loan or mortgage insurance premiums, of a newly constructed building or of an alteration of an existing building above 5,000 gross square feet within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk shall consider updating its procedures for providing the assistance to be consistent with sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order, to ensure appropriate consideration of wildfire-resistant design and construction.\n(g) To the extent permitted by law, the heads of all agencies may:\n(i) require higher performance levels than exist in the codes described in section 2(a) of this order;\n(ii) apply the requirements within section 2(a) of this order to new buildings less than 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk; and\n(iii) apply the requirements within section 2(b) of this order to existing buildings less than 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk.\n(h) When calculating whether a building is at moderate or greater wildfire risk, agencies should act in accordance with the methods described in the 2015 edition of the IWUIC, or any subsequent version that is determined to be a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), or an equivalent code, or in accordance with an equivalent method.\n(i) Each building constructed or altered in accordance with section 2(a) or (b) of this order shall comply with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, only to the maximum extent feasible as determined by the head of an agency.\nSec. 3. Agency Responsibilities. (a) The heads of all agencies that own Federal buildings above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk shall determine the appropriate process within their respective agencies to ensure compliance with this order.\n(b) The Mitigation Framework Leadership Group (MitFLG) shall: (i) create implementing guidelines to advise and assist agency compliance with the code requirements within 240 days of the date of this order;\n(ii) provide assistance to the agencies in interpreting the implementing guidelines.\n(c) When determining whether buildings are located within the wildland-urban interface, agencies shall use the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service's, \"The 2010 Wildland-Urban Interface of the Conterminous United States,\" or an equivalent tool.

Policy. As articulated in Presidential Study Directive-10 (PSD-10), preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States. Noting that governmental engagement on mass atrocities and genocide too often arrives too late, when opportunities for prevention or low-cost, low-risk action have been missed, PSD-10 directed the establishment of an interagency Atrocities Prevention Board (Board), with the primary purpose of coordinating a whole-of-government approach to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. PSD-10 also directed an interagency study to develop and recommend the membership, mandate, structure, operational protocols, authorities, and support necessary for the Board to coordinate and develop atrocity prevention and response policy. This order continues in place the Board established in 2012 as I directed in PSD-10, sets out the support to be afforded by executive departments, agencies, and offices, and updates and memorializes the terms on which the Board will continue to operate in the service of its important mission.\nSec. 2.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117422", "text": "Via Telephone\n4:22 P.M. EDT\nMR. STROH: Thank you very much. And, everyone, thanks for joining us this afternoon on a press conference call to preview the President's trip to Vietnam and Japan. Today we have with us Ambassador Mike Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative; Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; Wally Adeyemo, the Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics; and Dan Kritenbrink, the Senior Director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. As a reminder, this call is on the record, but we will embargo the call until the conclusion of the call.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Ben Rhodes.\nMR. RHODES: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. I'll just start by giving an overview of the President's schedule and some of the key objectives of the trip. I'll hand it over to Wally to speak to the G7, the process in which he's U.S. sherpa and lead, and then to Ambassador Froman to speak to some of the trade issues particularly related to TPP, given that we are traveling to two TPP countries.\nFirst of all, let me just say at the outset that this trip I think continues to demonstrate and elevate the President's focus on the Asia Pacific region. The Asia rebalance has been a central objective of the President's broader foreign policy and economic policy, rooted in our belief that this largest-emerging market in the world is critical to our future prosperity and also central to a whole host of critical U.S. national security interests as well.\nAnd this trip, in particular, highlights both the emerging U.S. partnership with Vietnam that has already grown by leaps and bounds since the normalization process began, but is poised to be elevated to a new level -- the U.S.-Japan alliance, which is, of course, the cornerstone of our approach to stability and security in Asia, together with our other treaty alliances, and, of course, the G7, which is one of the principal forums in which we address international issues.\nI think what's notable about the trip, and you will see in the schedule, is it speaks to the breadth of our engagement with these countries in that we are addressing security and strategic issues; we are addressing significant economic and commercial issues, including the fact that both of these countries are a part of TPP; and growing people-to-people exchanges.\nObviously, there is also a significant amount of history between the United States and Vietnam, and the United States and Japan that we can speak to in the Q&A. But I do think that the quality of our relationships with both Vietnam and Japan just demonstrate how far we have come, from a difficult past, in forging constructive relationships that benefit the peoples of the United States and Vietnam, as well as the peoples of the United States and Japan.\nSo we will be leaving here on Saturday afternoon and arriving in Vietnam on Sunday night. And so our official program in Vietnam will begin at Hanoi on Monday, May 23rd. The President will begin with an official arrival ceremony, and then he will be having a bilateral meeting with the President of Vietnam. Following that bilateral meeting, the two leaders will be having a press conference -- a joint press conference together.\nAfter that, we anticipate the President will have the opportunity to interact with the new head of the National Assembly in Vietnam. He will then be hosted at a state luncheon in Vietnam, and he will then have a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Vietnam. Following that, he will have a bilateral meeting with the General Secretary of the Community Party of Vietnam.\nSo this series of bilateral meetings I think demonstrates the breadth of our engagement with the Vietnamese. We'd expect to have a very robust agenda that will include a range of issues, including the cooperation that we pursued to complete the TPP negotiations; our significant efforts to promote greater commercial ties that benefit growth and job creation in both of our countries; the discussion that we've had on regional security issues, both bilaterally and through ASEAN, which addresses many issues to include cooperation on areas like maritime security and disaster response; and our commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes in the region; and our emerging and growing people-to-people ties and cooperation in areas like education and entrepreneurship.\nSo we'll have a broad agenda with the Vietnamese. But I think what we want to demonstrate with this visit is a significant upgrade in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam as partners on many issues, even as we have areas of difference that will continue to be the case.\nOn Tuesday, May 24th, the President will have a meeting with members of Vietnamese civil society as he does in countries around the world. He always like to take the opportunity to meet with both governmental representatives, but also representatives of civil society. That will also give him an opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to human rights and inclusive governance in Vietnam, as we do in countries around the world. So he'll have an opportunity to hear the views and concerns of civil society and share his own thoughts in return.\nFollowing that, the President will give a speech to the Vietnamese people as, again, he's done in many countries. This is an opportunity I think for the President to step back and reflect upon the enormous progress that has been made over the last two decades in advancing the U.S.-Vietnamese bilateral relations.\nIt will very much focus on the bilateral relationship, on our areas of cooperation, on the future vision that he has for the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. And, of course, there will be areas of difference, but we address those differences respectfully. And, frankly, having a new and broader relationship I think affords us greater opportunity to have respectful dialogue -- again, both about areas of common interest and about areas of continued differences.\nFollowing that speech, he will be leaving Hanoi and traveling to Ho Chi Minh City. When he arrives in Ho Chi Minh City, we will be visiting the Jade Pagoda to be able to pay tribute to and admire the cultural traditions of Vietnam. Following the visit to the Pagoda, he will have an event that is focused on both our commercial ties and on entrepreneurship. He'll be able to meet with some young Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are doing important work, and then he'll be able to participate in a discussion that lifts up the benefits of TPP to both of our countries, and the ability of TPP to promote growth and job creation and also high standards on issues like labor and the environment. And I'll leave it to Mike to discuss that in greater depth. That will conclude his day in Ho Chi Minh City.\nThen on Wednesday, May 25th, the President will host a town hall with members of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. As you may know, we launched YSEALI a number of years ago. It has grown by leaps and bounds to include engagements with thousands of young people across the 10 ASEAN countries, including significant participation from young Vietnamese.\nSo as he has done in other countries -- in Myanmar, in Malaysia, and in others -- he'll have the opportunity to speak and take questions from young Vietnamese. So, again, I think this visit is unusually long -- we're spending three days in Vietnam, going to two cities, addressing the strategic, security, economic, and people-to-people relationship that we're building, and we intend for this to be a truly impactful visit in the history of U.S.-Vietnamese relations.\nAfter that, we will fly from Vietnam to Japan for the G7 Summit. I will leave it to my colleague, Wally, to talk through the sessions and agenda for the G7 Summit. I will say that, of course, there are some outstanding scheduling issues. What we would anticipate is that the President will have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. When we have a time set for that, we will, of course, let you know. And then in addition to that bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe, he will be participating throughout the day on Thursday in the G7 Summit.\nThen he will begin his final day on Friday with the remaining sessions of the G7 Summit. Following the G7 Summit, he will leave and he will fly to Hiroshima. I think he'll have an opportunity -- given that we will be flying into Iwakuni Base -- to also thank some of the U.S. and Japanese servicemembers who work together and represent our alliance in action today. But then he will proceed to Hiroshima.\nObviously this is an incredibly important visit for the Japanese people and the American people. We've discussed this, we're happy to take your questions about it. But of course he'll be -- we still haven't finalized every element of the program, but we anticipate that he'll of course be able to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial to lay a wreath and engage in a brief tour of the memorial grounds, after which he will be able to deliver a statement reflecting upon what his impressions are. He will be accompanied by Prime Minister Abe of Japan.\nI'd just say briefly at the outset that you've heard us say that, first, this will be an opportunity for him to reflect on the extraordinary human toll of war and the loss of innocents in World War II -- the loss of innocents, of course, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also in many countries around the world. I think the President wants to pay recognition to the human toll of war, and obviously this is a particularly powerful site for him to do so.\nSecond, he will of course be reaffirming his commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. We have said that, as the one nation to have used nuclear weapons, the United States has a unique and moral responsibility to work on behalf of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. And we hope to instill in the world a greater sense of urgency around that agenda around the President's visit.\nAnd lastly, he'll have an opportunity I think to speak to the fact that from the tragedy of war, the U.S. and Japan have been able to build an extraordinary alliance that benefits both of our people. And his message in that regard will be forward-looking; that as we reflect on and confront directly and engage in dialogue about our history, we are focused on the future we're trying to seek -- a future of greater peace and cooperation, of nonproliferation going forward.\nI'll stop there because that's the conclusion of the President's trip. Again, there will be some other potential scheduling engagements that are added. But I'll turn it over to Wally to walk through the G7 agenda.\nMR. ADEYEMO: Thanks, Ben. The G7 this year will offer several tangible opportunities to make progress on a host of issues that the leaders of the G7 have been addressing for the President's two terms in office, starting with the global economy.\nWhile the United States has been relatively a pillar of strength within the G7 economies, growth has been overall moderate and uneven. The global economic discussion will give the leaders an opportunity to talk about what they can do collectively as leaders of seven of the largest developed economies to boost global demand, especially in the environment of low interest rate, and a need for increased investment.\nIn addition to a conversation about the overall global economy, there will be a conversation about the trade agenda. The G7 nations are all engaged in various regional trade agreements. The United States -- and I'll allow Ambassador Froman to speak to these -- but it's engaged in trade agreements with Japan, Canada, in TPP, and with the European Union in T-TIP. In addition to that, other countries -- for example, Canada and the European Union -- are also in discussions about a regional trade agreement, as are the Japanese and the Europeans.\nSo there will be a discussion about those trade agreements, but in addition to that, there will be a conversation about what we can do to make sure that we are using our trade and trade enforcement tools and our trade agreements to maximize the benefits to our workers and our firms, and to level the playing field. There will also be a discussion about over-capacity in this session, and what we can do to address over-capacity in several areas with an emphasis on steel and how we can use our collective action to best ensure that over-capacity is addressed.\nIn addition to that, our leaders will have a conversation about foreign policy and the foreign policy challenges that they face that will largely reflect the conversations that occurred amongst our foreign ministers when they met in Hiroshima. They will also have the opportunity to take note of the climate change agenda that was set in Paris in 2015, and to talk about what we can do to ambitiously implement that agenda consistent with our goal of reducing the temperature by 1.5 and 2 degrees.\nWe will also have an opportunity to hear from a number of Asian countries. As Japan is the only Asian member of the G7, they have chosen to invite a number of Asian countries to talk about issues that are particular to Asia, but issues that also are relevant to the rest of the world. For example, infrastructure, the development agenda, the inclusion of women in the economy and society, and health care. These are issues that are not only important to our economies, but also socially important to us. And it will give us a chance to have a holistic conversation about what the G7 can do to advance the prosperity and the security of our people.\nAMBASSADOR FROMAN: Great. Thank you, Ben and Wally. Let me talk a little bit about Vietnam and touch on the trade issues regarding the visit to Japan.\nWith Vietnam -- 90 million people, rapidly growing middle class -- a middle class that is expected to double between 2014 and 2020. And one thing we know is that as middle class consumers emerge, they want more of everything that the United States is well-positioned to make and to export. But we face significant barriers to those exports.\nSo in Vietnam, for example, U.S. auto exports face a 70 percent tariff, 74 percent tariff on motorcycles, 32 percent tariff on auto parts. Made-in-America machinery like construction equipment are hit with tariffs as high as 59 percent; beef, 34 percent; poultry, 40 percent. So we face these barriers getting our products into Vietnam, and those tariffs need to be eliminated or greatly reduced through the TPP implementation.\nThe reason why that's important is that our market is already very open. So we have average applied tariffs of 1.4 percent compared to the tariffs that I just described for you. We don't use non-tariff regulations as a barrier to trade. And TPP gives us an opportunity to level the playing field for our workers and ranchers and farmers and firms so that they can get more of their products into this fast-growing market.\nBeyond the tariffs, though, and the non-tariff barriers is a set of rules the TPP represents. So, for intellectual property -- issues like counterfeits or trade secrets. The rules around the digital economy, making sure the Internet stays open and free and there's a free flow of data across borders. Obligations to prevent governments from replacing tariffs with non-tariff barriers. Rules assuring that state-owned enterprises, of which there are many in Vietnam, have to compete on a level playing field against our private firms, and our private firms now have recourse if they don't.\nIssues around, very importantly, labor and the environment. Vietnam has agreed to allow independent unions that can control their own finances, elect their own leaders, conduct strikes, affiliate as they wish, get assistance from outside labor organizations. They've agreed to the five basic ILO labor principles -- the right to associate, the right to collective bargain, prohibitions on child labor and forced labor, prohibitions on employment discrimination. They've agreed the acceptable conditions of work -- having a minimum wage, hours regulations, safe workplace conditions. And all those obligations under TPP are fully enforceable, meaning that their access to our market is tied to their compliance with these provisions.\nSame thing on the environmental side. Vietnam is a market for much of the illegally traded wildlife around the world, and they've agreed to take on obligations to combat illegal wildlife trade as well.\nSo there's a great opportunity here. This is the next phase in our economic relationship with Vietnam that, as Ben said, has been growing since normalization of relations 20 or so years ago.\nJapan, as Wally mentioned, of course, is another TPP partner. They're working their way through ratification of TPP. And there, too, are great economic opportunities -- from the ag side, where they have a 3.2 percent tariff on beef, substantial protection around pork, obstacles to our exports on dairy products that will be dealt with through TPP, to the auto side, where we have a special agreement with Japan to deal with the non-tariff barriers to our auto exports.\nSo it will be very important that we engage with Japan and the other parties at the G7 about the ratification process for TPP in the various countries and the continuing work that needs to be done in T-TIP to bring political will to the table to address the outstanding issues in a pragmatic and creative manner with the goal of, as the President said in Hannover, trying to reach agreement on T-TIP over the course of this year.\nQ: A question related to Vietnam. What's the decision, if, in fact, one has been made yet, on whether there should be a full lifting of the arms embargo on Vietnam, or whether it should stay in place? And what might be the timing of such an announcement before departure, or possibly during the trip? Or are we talking about taking longer?\nMR. RHODES: Thanks, Matt, for the question. We have not finalized a decision related to this issue. It is something that we regularly review and we certainly expect that it will be a subject of discussion with the Vietnamese. So I'd expect that this will be discussed in the context of the President's meetings, and it's something that we obviously have been looking at as we prepare for the visit in the context of our broader relationship. So we are thinking through how is our evolving security cooperation going to look moving forward. We are looking at, of course, how our broader relationship is evolving, including our continued commitment to support human rights in Vietnam.\nSo, again, I think this will be discussed in the context of where this relationship is going, and it's something that we'll certainly be addressing in the bilateral meetings with the Vietnamese. And we'll have the opportunity to -- they regularly raise this issue with us, and we'll, of course, want to have the opportunity to explain our thoughts to them, and I think we'll have the opportunity to discuss it in that context.\nI will say there's also obviously a lot of views on this issue in Congress, as well. And we've been engaged in consultations with Congress about this and other issues related to the U.S.-Vietnam relationship over the last days and weeks. So this has factored into the set of issues that we've been reviewing in preparation for the visit. We expect the President will be discussing this issue and how we intend to approach it going forward in his meetings in Hanoi.\nAnd we are looking at it, not narrowly, in the context of simply whether or not to look to them, but rather where is our relationship going, what is the most effective way of advancing our cooperation, but also in building the tougher relationship where we can cooperate on areas of common interest while also having productive and respectful dialogue on areas of disagreement, which of course is primarily focused on issues related to human rights. So we will, again, look forward to continuing this discussion with the Vietnamese and, of course, with those who are interested over the course of the visit.\nQ: Hi, Ben. Thanks. And can you tell us how you're viewing this EgyptAir incident now that U.S. officials have said that they suspect it was a bomb? Is this looking like this is going to be another case of the President traveling and issues of terrorism overshadowing the other issues on the trip? And secondly, on the TPP, given the roadblocks that have been out there -- that are still out there, what kind of progress do you expect to see towards finally ratifying this eventually? And what's your time frame, and when do you envision this actually happening? Thank you.\nMR. RHODES: Thanks, Michelle. On the first question, obviously we are deeply concerned about the situation involving the EgyptAir flight, and our hearts go out to the loved ones of those who are currently missing. Our government has not reached a formal determination about what took place. We have offered our assistance to the relevant authorities that are currently engaged in an investigation. And we will continue to provide you with updates if we draw any formal conclusions. Of course, again, the countries that are more directly involved -- Egypt and France -- are leading the investigation. We've offered our full support, and we obviously will be doing our own analysis of what we believe happened.\nWith respect to how that relates to the President's trip, we obviously have enormous economic and national security interests in the Asia Pacific region, just as we have a profound and enduring interest in preventing any acts of terrorism. And so we, of course, will be pursuing I think a very important assessment of an agenda that has an enormous bearing on the long-term interests of the American people and our national security and economic security going forward throughout the course of the trip as it relates to terrorism. And that, again, doesn't prejudice the investigation because there's not been any formal determination made. Clearly, that will also be a subject at the G7. One of the principal foreign policy areas that has been a focus of the G7 in recent years has been our shared efforts against terrorism.\nOn TPP, I'll turn it over to Mike. I will just say that I think that both of these countries are indications of the types of markets that are going to be critical to U.S. exports and job creation going forward. And so from just one perspective -- before I go to Mike -- I think it is a further demonstration of how important it is that the United States not be shut out of certain markets and have the ability to shape the rules of the road in this critically important region.\nBut I'm going to hand it over to our trade representative.\nAMBASSADOR FROMAN: Thank you, Ben. Just to build on that, we are and we have been in consultation with Congress since completing the agreement last October. We published it in November; we signed it in February. We're continuing to work through the various procedures laid out under Trade Promotion Authority that Congress approved last year and we're consulting with congressional leadership and the leadership of our committees on what the best timetable is for bringing this up for a vote.\nIn the meantime, we are working with members of Congress individually to walk them through the agreement, address their concerns, demonstrate what's in the agreement for their constituents or stakeholders that they care a lot about. We're working to resolve a handful of key issues that have been flagged as particularly important by members of Congress. And we've already started the process -- normally, after Congress approves a trade agreement, then we turn to the implementation process with the countries.\nAnd in this case, we've decided to accelerate that. In consultation with Congress, we are already working with the countries in the region on the various steps that they'll need to take to bring themselves into compliance with TPP. And that includes Vietnam, where we've already had teams out in Vietnam over the last couple of months talking to them about the array of obligations that they have under the agreement.\nQ: So I have a couple of questions for you. Specifically for Ben, what do you think about the absence of Russia from the summit table? How does it affect the discussion on Syria and ISIS, for instance? My final question is, is Obama going to be meeting with Hiroshima survivors during this trip? Thank you.\nMR. RHODES: Thanks. On the first question, we have been very clear that the G7, formerly the G8, part of the basis of the organization is to have cooperation on behalf of the fundamental international principles and norms that allow for peaceful development, peaceful relations among countries. And when Russia flouted those rules because of its violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the decision was taken collectively that Russia should not participate in upcoming G7 meetings.\nSo it was entirely Russia's determination to violate the most basic international principle, which is the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country. That led to this being a G7. Of course, the option continues to be available to Russia to change course and to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Until it does, not only are they not participating in the G7 meeting, but of course, together with the other G7 countries we've imposed very significant sanctions on Russia, related to its actions in Ukraine.\nI will take the opportunity to briefly say that Russia has an opportunity in front of themselves, together with the Ukrainian government and the separatists, to fully implement the Minsk agreement, which would both be of great benefit to the people of Ukraine but also we've been very clear it could create a pathway for the relaxation of those sanctions.\nWith respect to Syria and ISIL, Russia's absence from this forum does not foreclose our ability to be engaged in regular dialogue with them about those issues. And, in fact, we've been deeply engaged in discussions with Russia about the cessation of hostilities that we've sought to preserve within Syria about the efforts to promote a peace process in Geneva. Secretary Kerry and Prime Minister Lavrov have spoken about that. President Obama and President Putin have. So we have those channels of communication just as we have efforts to de-conflict our military efforts in Syria. But again, I think it's important that it is demonstrated that there's a cost for actions that violate basic international law, and that's why this is a G7 meeting.\nOn the Hiroshima program, we have not finalized the elements of the President's visit, including who he might meet with or interact with while he's in Hiroshima. So we will provide you with updates as that is further developed. Again, what we do know is that he will visit the Peace Memorial, that he will be joined by Prime Minister Abe, that he'll have an opportunity to lay a wreath but also to offer his reflections on his visit. And I know that he is very much anticipating the opportunity to have that experience and to speak to the people of Japan and the United States and the world about what he takes away from that experience.\nQ: Hi, thanks for having this call. You mentioned over-capacity, so, Wally, or Mike Froman, just wanted to ask, I assume the main focus would be on over-capacity of base metals like steel products and aluminum that's weighing on G7 economies and the U.S. And I'm just wondering -- these countries have met before at the OECD and elsewhere on this issue. I'm just wondering, is the G7 where -- a place where we would expect a plan of action on this? Or is it just a place for countries to discuss their individual actions that they might take? And where would the U.S. be in that process? China and even South Korea are right next door to the G7 meetings, so I'm just curious to see how that's going.\nMR. ADEYEMO: I think, as you know well, the solution to over-capacity, especially in the base metals, requires a global solution. And while the G7 is a large segment of the global economy, it isn't the entire global economy. The meeting gives us an opportunity to work together to organize our shared approach toward these issues, but we need to work alongside countries like South Korea and Brazil and India and other countries to hold those accountable who are responsible for over-capacity in the base metal sector.\nAnd I think our goal has been, in the United States, to use our trade enforcement laws aggressively to do that. But we know that this is a global problem that requires a global solution, and we want to do a better job of coordinating with our international partners in the G7 and in other forums.\nQ: Thanks for the call. It's a question for Ben or Dan. We've seen, again, in the last 24 hours, another escalation of tensions, and so I was trying to see what this intercepts -- the discussion about the Vietnam arms embargo, which is annoying the Chinese, and the ruling coming up. I was just wondering if you can say -- can tell us how are you kind of -- take a little bit of heat out of this issue, and whether you actually want to take a little bit of heat out of this issue.\nMR. KRITENBRINK: Look, our approach to the South China Sea has been very consistent, and you'll continue to see that going forward. We have demonstrated very clearly that we don't take a position on any of the competing sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, but we do very clearly take a position on how those disputes are resolved, and we make very clear they need to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law.\nAnd at the same time, we've demonstrated that the United States, as with all countries, enjoys certain rights under international law, including the freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight.\nYou have seen, as we have, the reports that there was an unsafe intercept in the South China Sea in the last 24 hours. We're looking into that incident. I don't have further details for it, but I think you're well aware that we routinely carry out naval and other operations, both in the airspace over the South China Sea and in the international waters of the South China Sea. We do those routinely, in a safe manner, and we'll continue to do that going forward.\nAlthough maritime issues is not the central focus of the visit per se, obviously these issues are of great importance to all countries in the region, including to Vietnam and to Japan, obviously to the United States. And I'm confident that when the President sits down with the Vietnamese leadership and with Prime Minister Abe, that this will be one important topic of discussion. And I also anticipate that the leaders at the G7 will have the opportunity to engage on these issues as well.\nMR. RHODES: The only thing I'd add, Andrew, is just a couple things. I mean, one is we also have worked to ensure that we have military-to-military engagement with China, in part so that we have the capacity to raise concerns around particular issues, and just have open lines of communication.\nThe second thing that I'd say is that the United States' role in the region has been to reinforce international rules of the road and peace and stability. And for decades, that presence has helped facilitate peaceful development in the Asia Pacific region. And to the extent to which there is behavior that seeks to take these types of territorial disputes and put them into the type of dynamic where a bigger nation is seeking to inserts its rule over a smaller one, I think that raises concerns in the region. And it only reinforces the need to have a dialogue around support for clear international rules of the road.\nAnd so we pursued that discussion at Sunnylands with the ASEAN countries -- several of whom are claimants, several of whom aren't -- but all of them have an interest in the peaceful resolution of disputes and the free flow of commerce through the South China Sea. We'll certainly have that discussion with Vietnam. It's only one element of many aspects of our cooperation on security and economic issues.\nBut again, I think what we see is an interest in the region and the United States being present as a country that is committed to international rules and norms. And that will be our consistent message throughout the course of the visit.\nI think we have time for a couple more questions.\nQ: I have two questions, one for Ambassador Froman on TPP. You talked a lot about exports to a growing middle class in Vietnam, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the other phenomenon, which is that I think apparel and footwear textiles imports to the U.S. from Vietnam stand to gain from the lowering of U.S. tariffs. I think the ITC report yesterday talked about imports from TPP countries, especially Vietnam and those markets, we expand by 23 percent, and that ultimately manufacturing jobs would actually diminish compared to baseline assumptions. What does that say to American shoe manufacturers and others who were saying the final remaining jobs we have are destined to go to offshore because of this deal? Is that just the future of kind of where we're headed, and the U.S. has to focus on other jobs? Is that the message for this deal?\nAnd then one for Ben, if I could, about Japan and the President's visit to Hiroshima. There are those who say the President's visit will -- even if he's not apologizing -- will bring even more closure and final reconciliation to the people in Hiroshima, but that then it's up to the Japanese Prime Minister, whether it's Abe or a future one, to take more steps to close the World War II chapter in Asia, despite what he did on the comfort women and some of the speeches to Congress, and on the 70th anniversary last year in Japan. I wonder if you had thoughts about that, or whether you believe Japan has done enough at this point to move forward in the region, and whether at all there's any talk between the U.S. and Japan of having Prime Minister Abe visit Pearl Harbor before President Obama leaves office.\nAMBASSADOR FROMAN: Thanks, David. On your TPP question, we worked very closely with both the domestic footwear and apparel manufacturers here in the United States as well as the importers throughout the negotiations. And the final deal was endorsed both by the footwear producers in the U.S. and the footwear importers, same thing. The textile industry endorsed it as well as the apparel importers.\nJust take footwear, for example. There are high tariffs of our footwear exports into Japan that will be eliminated. So we're going to see our exports go up. We will see, I believe it's a 2 percent increase in imports of footwear, so most of those increased imports from Vietnam is production shifting from China to Vietnam. It's not all an increase in imports to the U.S.\nWith regard to the manufacturing question you asked, I think that points to one of the limitations of the model, which is, as you probably know, the ITC model assumes that the trade deficit remains the same -- the trade balance stays the same as a percentage of GDP. So as they show increases of exports in one sector, they need to show decreases in exports or increases in imports in other sectors. And it's a relative measure based on where they see the most significant increases in productivity.\nAnd that's why it shows greater gains in services than it may in some other sectors. But it doesn't mean that in reality there's going to be a decline relative to the baseline.\nMR. RHODES: Thanks, David, for your question. I'd say a couple things. First of all, we said that this is not about issuing an apology. And of course, the American people are extraordinarily proud of the generation of servicemembers who fought in World War II, at a time of maximum peril to our nation, and they have a revered place in our society.\nWhat we are able to do in going to Hiroshima is to pay tribute to the enormous suffering and loss of innocence in war. And, first of all, as I said in the opening, you're talking about a conflict that had an enormous human toll, with tens of millions of people killed around the world, including so many innocents. And even in Hiroshima, you had obviously an extraordinary loss of life of innocent Japanese civilians, and you also had the loss of life of many Koreans who were present in Hiroshima, and even American servicemembers who were there.\nAnd I think that the President's message, therefore, is, in part, that leaders and citizens have to be mindful going forward about the enormous cost of war, and that we can never forget the toll that war takes on innocent life.\nSecondly, of course, as I mentioned, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are symbols of both that loss of innocent life, but also the toll of nuclear weapons. And it is very important that leaders not lose urgency -- as we get farther and farther away from the use of nuclear weapons, that we not lose urgency in seeking to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and ultimately pursue a world without them.\nAnd we've spent a lot of time promoting nuclear security and seeking to reduce our deployed stockpile and launchers through the New START Treaty, and trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons through the Iran deal, and of course, in dealing with the extraordinary challenge from North Korea as it pursues a nuclear program.\nSo it's an opportunity to I think focus the world's attention on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them.\nWith respect to Pearl Harbor, I'd just say, first of all, that we draw no linkages to our decision to go to Hiroshima. This is the President's decision. And he is making this decision be he believes that it's important to acknowledge history; it's important to look squarely at history; it's important to have a dialogue about history. And every leader has to make their own choices about how they will do that.\nWe have encouraged all leaders in Asia to try to look at these difficult historical issues in a manner that promotes dialogue and understanding and ultimately reconciliation.\nIn that context, we very much welcomed the agreement that was reached with respect to comfort women. And there are many different issues -- and I should add that a great deal of courage from both Prime Minister Abe and President Park, given how important the history of the comfort women is to the people of the Republic of Korea.\nAnd there are many historical issues that continue to be hotly discussed and debated in the Asia Pacific. I think our point is that the more that there's able to be peaceful dialogue about those issues, the more they will not be sources of tension going forward, but rather we can overcome those issues. And, frankly, again, the very fact that the United States is traveling to Japan, that it's now one of our closest allies in the world, and Vietnam, which is a merging partner of ours I think demonstrates how you are able to move beyond difficult history, and that's what we would encourage the countries of the Asia Pacific to do.\nSo Prime Minister Abe will make his own decisions about how he addresses these issues and about Pearl Harbor, but I think that's certainly how President Obama views it.\nLast question.\nQ: All my questions have actually already been addressed so I'll let someone else go.\nQ: I wondered if in Hiroshima if the President had any plans to use his reflections to offer any new or concrete steps on how to reduce nuclear weapons, globally or in the U.S. And in that same vein, can you comment on the notion that the world is actually further away from the President's goal of a nuclear-free world now than it was when he gave his speech in Prague seven years ago?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, we're not going to give a major policy address in Hiroshima. We just, frankly, didn't think that it was the appropriate venue. This is such a powerful place and so therefore we thought that a simple reflection on the cost of war and the cost of nuclear weapons was the appropriate way for the President to speak from the heart about his reflections.\nI will say that, again, we do hope that in visiting Hiroshima, we're able to once again spotlight the imperative that the world has to seek a reduction and ultimate elimination of the risk of nuclear weapons.\nLook, I would -- it might not surprise you -- take a different view of I think what's happened since we took office. I think we made progress on a number of fronts, even as we acknowledge, and we'd be the first to acknowledge, that there's a lot more work to do. First of all, we made clear from the beginning of our time in office that we wanted to keep our own NPT commitments to pursue the reductions of our own stockpiles. And the new START treaty in the first term was one of the most significant arms control agreements of recent years. It significantly reduced our deployed stockpiles and launchers with Russia, and demonstrated that we were once again moving in that direction.\nSecondly, we reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our own national security strategy so that we are less reliant on nuclear weapons as we address issues around the world.\nThirdly, we've hosted a series of nuclear summits that have significantly enhanced nuclear security protocols and eliminated a significant amount of nuclear material -- again, all of which is to help keep the most dangerous material out of the hands of terrorists and other actors who we would not want to obtain weapons.\nThen, in terms of nonproliferation -- and I think this is really important -- over the course of the last decades since the Cold War, you've seen the proliferation and spread of nuclear weapons through a number of states.\nDuring President Obama's seven and a half years in office, there has not been any new member of the nuclear club, in large part because we were able to reach a diplomatic agreement with the Iranian government and the P5+1 that assures and verifies that they will not be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and that, in fact, has demonstrably rolled back their nuclear program. They've shipped out their stockpile, converted their reactors, and taken other steps to allow for the verification that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\nSo on nonproliferation and nuclear security and arms control, I think there are things that we are quite proud of. However, to be very specific about what has not taken place, and very straightforward about that, we had indicated an interest in additional arms control. And Russia, particularly after President Putin took office, indicated that they were not interested in pursuing that discussion, so we were not able to have an additional round of discussions around further arms control agreements. So that's one example of an area where we think that there's further progress.\nThere are other areas where we'd like to see continued progress around agreements like a fissile material cutoff treaty, where, again, there continue to be challenges in building an international consensus around those issues.\nSo we certainly acknowledge that there's more to be done. But we do believe that we have bent the curve in the right direction on nonproliferation nuclear security, the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and our own stockpile and launchers. I know there's some controversy around some of our modernization, but what we would say is what President Obama said in Prague, which is as long as nuclear weapons exist, we do need to have an effective and credible deterrent, both for our own security and for the security of allies like Japan and the Republic of Korea.\nSo again, we hope in going that we're able to energize that process, lift up progress that's been made, but also with that, spotlight additional efforts that need to be done. That's all for the better, and we welcome that attention. And we hope to do as much as we can with our time in office, and then we hope that, going forward, future administrations pursue that goal of ultimately -- the goal that, I should say, not just President Obama but Presidents like President Reagan and President Kennedy embraced, which was the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\nSo I'll stop there. Sorry to go on. I didn't want to just credit ourselves; I also wanted to be very clear that we do recognize that the President's Prague agenda is unfinished, but that's part of the reason for shining a light on these issues in Hiroshima.\nSo thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\nMR. STROH: Ladies and gentlemen, just as a reminder, the call was on the record, and now that we have concluded, the embargo is lifted. Thanks very much for your participation.\nEND 5:18 P.M.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117425", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:23 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Thank you. Starting with the news that everyone woke up to today. What conclusions has the United States government reached about what may have brought down the Egyptian airline?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start, Darlene, by offering our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who were aboard EgyptAir Flight 804. The uncertainty and creeping sense of loss that the loved ones of those who were lost on the plane must be experiencing right now is painful to even contemplate.\nThe President, as you all are aware, has received multiple updates from his national security team on the situation. U.S. national security and aviation experts have been in touch with their counterparts in France and Egypt to offer assistance. Many of you all have probably also seen the announcement from the Department of Defense that the United States Navy is working to deploy a P-3 Orion aircraft to provide support for the search of the missing jetliner.\nAt this point, Darlene, to go straight to your question, it's too early to definitively say what may have caused this disaster. The investigation is underway and investigators will consider all of the potential factors that could have contributed to the crash. And obviously if there's an opportunity for the United States government to support those efforts then we will do that. And the President asked his team to keep him apprised of developments as they occur.\nQ: Switching topics to Puerto Rico and the legislation on the Hill, the agreement on a new bill. Is there any reaction from the White House on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the administration has made clear for several months now that any legislation to address the crisis in Puerto Rico must provide a workable and comprehensive restructuring authority with appropriate oversight that respects Puerto Rico's self-governance. We're encouraged to see the House introduce legislation yesterday that provides Puerto Rico with these tools to address a crisis that's having a negative impact on the 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. There are tangible, real-world, negative consequences for Americans living in Puerto Rico.\nAnd we continue to believe that additional measures are necessary to help Puerto Rico grow its economy and address this humanitarian crisis. But the legislation that was unveiled late last night is an important first step. We believe that overall the legislation provides a fair process for Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and create a foundation for economic recovery after enduring a decade of recession.\nQ: There's one other thing I'd like to ask you about. The chief of staff to the Hungarian Prime Minister today said that President Obama and the United States favor immigration to Europe because they want to send all the Muslims to Europe. Is there anything you want to say in response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see those comments. I'm not sure they're worthy of a response.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, is the United States concerned about security at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, and are you concerned about reports that Islamic State militants have infiltrated that airport and others?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the United States does have a relationship through TSA and DHS with those airports around the world that are the last point of departure to the United States. So the United States has successfully worked with security officials at airports across the country to ensure that international flights arriving in the United States are subject to more exhaustive security and screening procedures to ensure the safety of the American traveling public.\nAgain, at this point, it's too early to say what potential factors may have contributed to this particular incident. But it is fair for you to observe and for the American people to understand that over the last 18 to 24 months, the Department of Homeland Security has made some important enhancements to those international airports that are the last points of departure for international flights. And that includes expanded screening that's applied to a variety of items that could be transported on an aircraft, so not just carry-on baggage but other baggage and other equipment that is maintained on the aircraft.\nTSA officials have also engaged in conducting airport assessments in conjunction with our international partners to ensure the security of the terminal and the airport more broadly. And the DHS has worked with partners to offer assistance to certain foreign airports related to broader aviation and airport security questions. There's extensive expertise that exists at TSA, and working with the operators at foreign airports, we've been able to use that expertise to discuss best practices that could be used to enhance security at foreign airports.\nQ: Do you have any specific concerns, though, about the Paris airport?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing that I have to articulate from here. Obviously there are U.S. flights that originate from that airport and the United States has a very important national security relationship with France and that would extend to our coordination on issues related to aviation security. But I don't have anything specific to raise in terms of concerns about the security situation in Charles de Gaulle.\nQ: More broadly, does the United States have concerns about militants from the Islamic State infiltrating airports, be it in Europe or be it elsewhere in the world?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would say something that probably is even slightly broader than the way that you asked your question. We have seen a desire on the part of extremists around the world, including some extremists in the Middle East, to carry out attacks targeting the international aviation system, so we obviously are mindful of that. And here in the United States we've experienced the pain of those aviation-borne attacks firsthand on 9/11. So our experts at the TSA take very seriously the need to apply adaptive security measures to ensure the safety of our aviation system. They pursue a layered approach that involves a variety of technologies and tactics, and these are tactics that they can be shared with our partners around the world and applied in airports around the world.\nSo we've obviously learned a lot since 9/11 about what's necessary to protect the aviation system. But that has not diminished the desire of some extremist organizations to try to carry out attacks against the aviation system. We're aware of that, and we are constantly countering that threat by adapting our security system to protect the traveling public.\nQ: Finally, you said it's too early to comment on what the causes were. Are you able, or has the U.S. intelligence community been able to rule out anything, such as a bomb? Or has anything so far, from the United States' perspective, been ruled out?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any sort of intelligence assessment that has ruled anything out. I'm also not aware of any intelligence assessment that's ruled anything in at this point. So we're still quite early in this investigation, and investigators will examine all of the potential factors that may have contributed to this tragedy.\nToluse.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Puerto Rico. You mentioned that you think there are still more steps that need to be taken in addition to this bill, but as the bill stands now, would you sign it? Is this something that the White House supports?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we are encouraged that Democrats and Republicans did work effectively together to produce this piece of legislation. Bipartisanship has been hard to come by in the United States Congress for a few years now, so that's why you heard me describe the fact that we're encouraged by the introduction of this legislation yesterday. So, yes, I think you could say that we are supportive of this legislative proposal to establish a fair process that allows Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and create a foundation for economic recovery.\nWhat's true, though, is that the introduction of legislation is just the beginning of the process. And this crisis in Puerto Rico can only end when Congress takes bipartisan action. And we urge members of Congress in both parties to stand firm against the special interests attempting to undermine this essential legislation. We urge Congress to act without delay to provide Puerto Rico with the tools that it desperately needs to address a situation that's having a negative impact on 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.\nQ: One of the fiscal reforms in the bill includes allowing the governor of Puerto Rico to reduce the minimum wage over five years, below the national average. Obviously, that's something\n-- the minimum wage is something the administration has pushed for increasing -- there are state increases as high as $15. So what's your response to the idea that Puerto Rico could be reducing its minimum wage less than $7.25?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding is -- I've been briefed on this provision -- is that it applies to a particular quirk in the law that actually affects people who are younger than age 20 who are working for the minimum wage and that it would allow their employer to pay them even below the minimum wage.\nI think it would be pretty hard for anybody to explain how exactly a 19-year-old Puerto Rican who's making minimum wage is somehow responsible for the situation or should be punished as a result of this situation, or that the situation would be improved if 19-year-old Puerto Ricans who are working minimum wage got paid less.\nSo, no, this is not a provision that we support. Supporters of this provision I think have a hard time justifying it, but in order to see bipartisan action in Congress, we are prepared to encourage Congress to pass a piece of legislation even if it's less than perfect.\nQ: And it seemed like one of the recent changes was actually increasing the age from 20 to 25. That was one of the things that got changed.\nMR. EARNEST: Exactly. And so, yes, are 23-year-old Puerto Ricans who are making minimum wage deserving of a pay cut, and somehow that's going to improve the economic climate in Puerto Rico? Again, we've seen mean-spirited policymaking on the part of Republicans for quite some time now. I think we'll just file this example in a rather large file. But the President has made assisting Puerto Rico and addressing their challenging economic situation a top priority, and sometimes getting bipartisan progress in Congress requires supporting legislation that's not perfect.\nOlivier.\nQ: Josh, back on the plane. Can you say whether and with what frequency the expanded screenings have resulted in thwarted plots against Americans?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an assessment of that. These expanded screenings, just to be clear, are applied to international aircraft that are bound for the United States. Obviously, EgyptAir Flight 804 took off from Paris and was bound from Cairo, so it wasn't subjected necessarily to these specific enhanced screening.\nQ: I understand.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an assessment for how those enhanced security measures have disrupted plots, but we do believe that expertise from the TSA and additional screening measures even at foreign airports does enhance the safety and security of Americans traveling abroad.\nQ: Two more. I'll try to keep them short. You said that investigators would look at all factors. Did you mean U.S. investigators? And if so, why are they involved at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I didn't say U.S. investigators.\nQ: But I'm just wondering --\nMR. EARNEST: What I have indicated -- and I think that this was part of the President's instruction -- is that U.S. officials, both national security officials and aviation experts, would be in touch with their counterparts and offering assistance. I'm not aware that that assistance has been accepted at this point, but certainly U.S. officials, including officials who could assist in the investigation of an aviation disaster, could be made available if requested.\nQ: Last one. When you were asked whether you had specific concerns about Charles De Gaulle Airport, you said nothing you can articulate from there. That doesn't sound terrifically reassuring.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess, what I'm saying is I can't offer a security assessment of any airport around the world, so I certainly would encourage you guys to check with TSA on that. But there's no specific concern that's been raised that I'm aware of.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said that it's too early, of course, to really know what happened. But even at this point, and even hours ago, Egyptian officials were saying that terrorism in this case is more likely than a technical fault on this plane. Does the administration share that view? Or does the U.S. have information that backs that likelihood up, at the very least?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, the information that is available is something that investigators are still taking a close look at and so I wouldn't hazard a guess at this point about what factors may have potentially contributed to this disaster. But obviously we're going to take a close look at all the available evidence and we're going to be in close touch with our counterparts, and if there is assistance that U.S. experts or U.S. national security officials can provide in the investigation, then we'll certainly do that.\nQ: So when Egyptian officials are saying it's likely terrorism, and other officials are speculating that, based on what we know happened, it looks like a bomb, is that something that is taken into account? I mean, do you feel that it's premature to make those assessments right now? Or is the U.S. looking at those assessments from other countries?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, right now, what the United States is doing is offering our assistance to those investigators who are taking a look at this information and trying to draw conclusions as best they can. So that's why I don't have a separate assessment to share from here. But we obviously want to be supportive of those who are conducting this investigation, and the deployment of a U.S. Navy aircraft to assist in the search is one tangible example of how U.S. assets can be used to benefit the ongoing effort.\nQ: But by saying it's too early to really know, you're not, by saying that, dismissing those early assessments?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm merely explaining why I don't have my own assessment to offer.\nQ: Okay. And because it is a question mark and because those assessments at this point are coming from elsewhere and this originated at an airport where flights to the U.S. originate, on its face, does this, at this point, raise the risk for U.S. passengers?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I think it's too early to reach that conclusion. Obviously national security officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA can offer up the best assessment about that. As I was explaining to Olivier, flights that originate from Charles De Gaulle that are bound for the United States are subjected to additional screening that may not have applied in this situation. So American passengers can certainly take some confidence from that.\nBut, look, we're only hours, not even days, into trying to get to the bottom of what exactly happened here. So we obviously are going to be very supportive of those who are conducting the investigation, and we are eager to understand exactly what may have contributed to this particular tragedy. And if it merits any sort of change in our security posture, then I'm confident that's something that will be carefully evaluated by DHS Secretary Johnson and TSA Administrator Neffenger to make the appropriate changes if necessary.\nQ: And because we don't know what happened here and terrorism is a possibility, can you just sort of broadly describe the kinds of additional measures that are going on in foreign airports by the TSA right now? I mean, can you say that this is something of an internal alert? Or because there are expanded measures already, are they now tighter immediately? I mean, what can you say about what happens after something like this has transpired?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what happens immediately when something like this transpires is that there is work -- well, that there are offers of assistance that are made to the investigators overseas that are conducting the investigation. And the United States has expertise and assets that other investigators may find useful. They certainly have been useful in other international investigations that have been conducted.\nBut there are a number of things that the TSA is engaged in, regardless of whether or not there is an unexplained crash like this one. So let me give you a couple more examples. In the fiscal year 2015, the TSA's transportation security specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 146 foreign airport assessments. So, again, this is an example of how expertise at the TSA can be deployed overseas to enhance not just the U.S. aviation system but the international aviation system.\nThe other thing that the TSA often does is they will deploy canine teams in airports, including teams that are sometimes led by state and local law enforcement as well as by TSA officers themselves. These teams operate in secure areas of the airport, including activities such as screening cargo and baggage as it's being loaded into the aircraft.\nThe other thing that DHS has been able to do is to establish something called preclearance. And there are a handful of airports around the world where international flights will originate and fly into the United States. And preclearance means that Customs and Border Patrol officers don't screen the passengers after they get off the plane but actually will engage in screening those passengers overseas on foreign soil before they even board a plane that is bound for the United States.\nAnd that means that the security of those flights is enhanced even further than they already would be. And there are 15 preclearance locations around the world right now, and DHS and CVP are working together to try to expand that program and, again, provide greater confidence that air passengers who are boarding flights bound for the United States have actually been thoroughly reviewed by U.S. national security professionals before they even board the plane.\nQ: Does TSA have any involvement in the maintenance of planes and how those procedures are done before that plane takes off?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that TSA has a maintenance function, but TSA can certainly provide assistance and advice to foreign airport officials as they try to secure sensitive parts of the airport. So that could include terminals, but that could also include sensitive maintenance areas. So while they're not, firsthand, involved in conducting that maintenance, they can certainly offer advice and assistance in terms of helping airport officials secure those sensitive parts of the airport.\nJuliet.\nQ: Continuing on the theme of bipartisan agreement on legislation, today a group of Republican and Senate Democrats have unveiled a bill to overhaul the decades-old Toxic Substances Control Act -- a chemical bill that is something the White House and EPA have been consulting on. Can you say at this point if the White House endorses this proposal, which has received considerable support from both parties in the Senate and, to a lesser degree, in the House?\nMR. EARNEST: I have to check with our team to see to what extent we've been briefed on the details of the proposals that's apparently been agreed to. So let me circle back with you on the details of that.\nRon.\nQ: I'm just trying to understand the investigative cooperation relationship between the U.S. and, say, the Egyptian and French and other authorities. Because you said that there have been offers of assistance and that so far they have not been accepted. Yet, at the same time, there's every -- well, there are some indications that this could be a terrorist attack, and this is obviously a big concern for the United States. So what you've described sounds more passive than active and aggressive and engaged. Do you see what I'm saying? And I'm just trying to understand why that is. Why is the United States not just -- why isn't there some sort of mechanism whereby because of -- again, there's been so much emphasis on intelligence-sharing and the fight against ISIS. Why isn't there some sort of mechanism or some sort of process whereby, given the work that TSA has done in these airports, that there's a much more aggressive and engaged posture by the United States when something like this happens?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think the first thing that we should step back and recognize is that this is an aircraft that did not originate on American soil. It was not bound for American soil; it was not an American airline. I'm not aware that the pilots were American. Obviously, the plane didn't crash in America. So there are other countries that have appropriate jurisdictions.\nAnd the United States has important relationships with both France and with Egypt. We've got an important relationship with Greek authorities, who had launched the preliminary search effort because this obviously took place near Greek waters. So there are reasons why there are other countries who were immediately responsible for dealing with this situation, but that has not at all resulted in a delay of the United States offering assistance, communicating with our partners in both of the countries, and being engaged in trying to get to the bottom of what exactly transpired.\nI did not mean to lead you to conclude that somehow our offers of assistance had been rebuffed, just that other countries have the lead. We have offered to help and we stand ready to provide that assistance as soon as they're ready to integrate it into their efforts.\nQ: So what if it's not accepted? Is this diplomatic language that you can't say --\nMR. EARNEST: Given the strong relationships between the United States and France, and the United States and Egypt, I'm confident that we'll be able to provide them the needed support to ensure that this investigation proceeds expeditiously and is conducted with a focus on getting to the bottom of what exactly transpired so that we can make any necessary changes -- whether that's changes to an aircraft, enhancements to maintenance, or taking additional security precautions to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public.\nQ: Right. Because, again, even though this does not involve an American plane or passengers or a pilot or airports, the international air system is essentially -- it's an international system. It's really not -- I mean, obviously it's not a state-separated system. And that's why -- again, so you have every expectation that the -- so at this moment, the FBI, the TSA, others are not actively involved in this investigation? They are essentially -- have extended an offer, and now some 12 or more hours after this happened, we're still waiting to hear whether or not they will be engaged and involved?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I would encourage you to consult with those individual agencies, and they can detail for you the kinds of conversations that they've had with our partners. But I have confidence that France and Egypt will seek whatever assistance is required, and the United States stands ready to provide as much assistance as is necessary to achieve our shared goal, which is to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask you questions on two different subjects. One, starting off with the airports and this crash, or this possible or alleged terrorist attack. What is the, I guess, conversations, and is there some line of conversation between the FAA here, intelligence officials, and their counterparts in other nations when it comes to airports and airlines? Because that is still considered the number-one target for terrorists, in airports. What kind of conversations are happening? And particularly when it comes to the uniformity in stepping up security in all of these airports around the country -- because every airport is different. Security in every airport is different.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, the priority that we have placed is on those airports overseas that are the last point of departure. So international aircraft that originate in other countries flying into the United States, those are, for obvious reasons, the point of emphasis that our security professionals have identified. And as a result, there are enhanced screening measures in place at airports around the world -- not on American soil -- but that are consistent with established standards put together by TSA to ensure the safety of flights bound for the United States that originate in other countries.\nIn addition to that, TSA obviously has experts and equipment and strategies for safeguarding aircraft, for safeguarding passengers, for safeguarding airports. And that assistance advice about that expertise is provided to our partners around the world. As I pointed out, in the last fiscal year, TSA security specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 146 foreign airport assessments. So I think that's an indication that the scope of their work is quite broad.\nBut in addition to that, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to expand their preclearance program that provides significantly enhanced screening of passengers who are originating -- who are trying to travel to the United States from overseas. And examining the passports and documentation of those passengers before they ever board the plane, ensuring that those aircraft and those passengers can be swept prior to boarding the plane consistent with U.S. standards is certainly another way that we can enhance the safety of the American traveling public.\nSo DHS and TSA and CVP and all of these national security agencies that have different responsibilities for protecting the American people are not just actively engaged in the United States in protecting the traveling public, but they're actively engaged overseas to ensure that international flights arriving in the United States are secure as well.\nQ: What I'm getting from what you're saying is there's not uniformity but there's efforts to increase and enhance it. So with that, what's the reality in the timeline that there could be uniformity in these airports where everyone is on the same page with documentation, screenings, et cetera?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I don't envision a scenario in which every single airport in the world has the same security screening measures.\nQ: I'm asking about the airports that -- as you say, there are efforts that you're making when it comes to security more so with the airports that have flights coming into the United States. When will there be -- what's the timeline for that uniformity as far as screenings and documentations, things of that nature?\nMR. EARNEST: Flights that are the last point of departure are subject to enhanced screening measures that are applied by TSA. So does that answer your question?\nQ: No.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would do is this. I think you should check with TSA and they can provide you a more detailed assessment of what security measures they have in place at airports around the world.\nQ: Make sure TSA and I can talk? Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: Anybody else?\nQ: I'm not finished with my other question -- I'm sorry. It was the Nigerian girls since we had the latest news yesterday. Could you talk to us about any intelligence you've received? What's the latest as relates to the Nigerian girls?\nMR. EARNEST: AS you know, April, extensive resources have been provided by the United States to the Nigerian officials who are responsible for searching not just for the Chibok girls but for the thousands of Nigerians who have been kidnapped by Boko Haram. Boko Haram is a vicious terrorist organization that has capitalized on kidnapping to try to raise money for their terrorist organization and to otherwise terrorize the people in that country and the people in that region. And the United States has provided intelligence, military and financial support to the Nigerian government as they confront this threat. And we continue to provide that even to this day.\nQ: And was that a glimmer of hope yesterday that even though she was found pregnant and they were questioning if that could have been one of the captors -- it was supposed to be her husband -- is there still a glimmer of hope that more will be found?\nMR. EARNEST: Certainly the United States continues to vigorously support the efforts of the Nigerian government. Ultimately, it's the Nigerian government who is responsible for conducting the search, and their search efforts have been enhanced greatly by the assistance provided by the United States.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two Chinese tactical jets have intercepted an American reconnaissance plane in the South China Sea. And I was wondering, how seriously are you taking this incident? Do you see it as a provocation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, the Department of Defense is reviewing public claims of a May 17 intercept of a U.S. maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft by two tactical aircraft from the People's Republic of China. The incident occurred in international airspace during a routine U.S. patrol in the South China Sea. Initial reports of the incident characterized it as \"unsafe.\"\nI can tell you more generally that the Department of Defense has made progress reducing the risk between U.S. operational forces and those of the People's Republic of China. We've reduced that risk by improving dialogue at multiple levels under the bilateral confidence-building measures and the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement. These are established diplomatic and military channels that allow the United States and China to communicate clearly and raise concerns about these kinds of issues when they arise.\nI'm told that the next Military Maritime Consultative Agreement talks are actually scheduled for May 24 and 25 in Hawaii. So there is a well-established diplomatic and military channel to work through these kinds of concerns. Over the course of the last year, the Department of Defense has seen improvements in the way that Chinese military pilots fly consistent with international guidelines and consistent with the way that aircraft can be operated in a safe and professional manner. But suffice it to say that the Department of Defense is addressing this issue through the appropriate channels.\nQ: Is the President typically told about these incidents, or this one in particular?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is certainly apprised of these developments as warranted. I don't know whether or not he received a specific briefing on this particular situation. Again, based on the kinds of improvements that we've seen over the last year, I think these kinds of incidents are not common. But there also was a pretty significant incident in the first few months of the Bush administration with Chinese military aircraft intercepting U.S. intelligence aircraft that resulted in a much more significant geopolitical incident. The reports of this incident obviously didn't result in the same kind of consequences.\nQ: This is obviously not an accident. Do you think that it's going to coincide with the President's trip to Vietnam?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll try to address this issue through the established channels. And presumably, in those channels, Chinese officials can explain their perspective on what exactly occurred. But I would hesitate to ascribe a motive at this point.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, you've been pretty restrained in how you've described what has happened with the EgyptAir flight. Donald Trump was out with a tweet this morning -- he says, \"Looks like another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?\" That would imply that this administration has not done those things in terms of being \"tough, smart and vigilant.\" What do you make of those comments? Inappropriate at this time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a specific reaction to that tweet. Obviously we believe that this investigation should move forward, and move forward expeditiously. And if conclusions point toward specific security concerns, then I'm confident that our security professionals will address it.\nBut since you, or someone else, brought it up, my colleagues at the Department of Defense did provide I think a pretty useful update on some of the progress that's been made against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria in recent weeks. So let me just point out a couple of the highlights.\nThe first is that we obviously are pleased with the progress that Iraqi security forces have made in the western Anbar town of Rutbah. This operation, once it's complete, will help the Iraqis reclaim Iraq's southwestern border and reestablish economic trade along highways between Jordan and Iraq. We obviously have been supportive of Iraqi forces that are operating in that area, and we're pleased to see them make important progress.\nI also have an updated assessment for you in terms of the success that Iraqi forces have had in driving ISIL out of populated territory in Iraq. The updated assessment is that now 45 percent of the populated area that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them. In Syria, that figure is now 20 percent, thanks to the work of local partners, including the Syrian-Arab coalition. That's an increase in both countries.\nIn addition, there are some additional metrics I can share with you here. DOD has indicated they have targeted and killed more than 120 high-value individuals in ISIL's attack network, including leaders, facilitators, planners and recruiters. And my colleagues at the Department of Defense have indicated that that's had a measurable impact on ISIL's effectiveness.\nThe coalition more broadly has trained more than 30,000 Iraqi security forces. They reported that, right now, nearly 5,000 Iraqi security forces are in training. That's about 3,800 Iraqi army soldiers and about 1,100 Peshmerga fighters in Erbil. Together, that is the highest number the coalition has been training at any one point in time.\nAnd then finally, I want to draw to your attention an announcement that was made today by the International Monetary Fund. They announced that they had come to an agreement with the government of Iraq on a $5 billion loan agreement over the next three years. Over the last several weeks, you've heard the President talking with a greater sense of urgency about the economic situation in Iraq, and obviously the security challenges in Iraq combined with some of the challenges that they've encountered in implementing political reforms, as well as the impact of a much lower global price of oil -- all have combined to have a negative impact on the economic situation in Iraq.\nAnd the President made a concerted effort to encourage our partners and allies who are part of the coalition to ramp up the financial assistance that they're providing to Iraq, both to offer support to the Abadi government, but also to offer support to the Iraqi government as they try to rebuild those areas that have been retaken from ISIL. We know that some of ISIL's tactics have been to essentially destroy the infrastructure of places that they had occupied.\nSo being able to quickly rebuild that infrastructure and allow people to move home is a top priority of the Abadi government and will be critical to the success of stabilizing and securing the country. And the international contribution to this effort is critical. And obviously, a $5.4 billion commitment from the IMF is significant.\nSo thank you for indulging me on that.\nQ: Well, ISIS hasn't claimed responsibility. Is there a reason you brought them up?\nMR. EARNEST: No, but I think that was implied in the tweet. And you had asked whether or not we had been vigorous in pursuing extremist organizations that have vowed to attack the United States, or at least our interests. And so it seemed appropriate to offer an update to our efforts against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\nQ: Lisa Monaco delivered the briefing this morning, I believe, to the President, according to your readout. Is that the U.S. official who has continued to update the President? Or are there others from different departments?\nMR. EARNEST: She will continue to be principally responsible for that, but obviously there are other officials, including in the intelligence community and other places, that may also have information to share with the President. But she obviously is the person responsible for that, principally.\nQ: Given her role in counterterrorism, it would imply that that is obviously a key concern when it comes to this EgyptAir crash, or disappearance, I suppose. Is that a fair thing to surmise?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, she is both the President's top counterterrorism advisor but also his top homeland security advisor, so it's also customary for her to apprise him of events that could have a potential impact on the homeland, even if they're not related to terrorism.\nQ: But is this being treated, I guess, like any other plane downing or disappearance? We've had a few in the past few years. I mean, is there something specific about this focus and how quickly the administration has responded -- about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the response that we have initiated here at the White House is consistent with any significant or potentially significant world event that could have an impact on U.S. policy. And certainly Ms. Monaco and her colleagues at the NSC have been conscientious about making sure the President has all of the information that he needs.\nQ: So in public discourse about this, do you think that terrorism is being too focused on? Or are we -- you're getting a lot of questions in this room specifically about that as a hypothesis that hasn't been ruled out. But is that the prime focus right now, ruling that out?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that our intelligence community has concluded that that's the prime focus at this point. But look, I think I'm not going to second-guess the questions that independent journalists choose to ask.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said today on TV that politics is the reason that the United States is not defining the mission in Iraq as a combat mission. He says he believes it is. He says it's a disservice to those out there putting their lives on the line, and \"incredibly unfortunate not to speak openly about what's going on.\" Is Secretary Gates wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Karen, we've had an opportunity to discuss this on a number of occasions from here. But I know that people like General Dunford and Secretary Carter have also had an opportunity to discuss this. The fact of the matter is we have worked very diligently to try to be as clear as possible about what mission our men and women in uniform have been given by the Commander-in-Chief in Iraq and in Syria. And the mission that they have been given and the responsibility that they are bearing is significant and dangerous. And I'm not aware of anybody in the administration who has sought to downplay that.\nWhat we have tried to do is to be as precise as possible in describing what exactly their mission is. And while their presence in Iraq and in Syria is dangerous and, on occasion, our men and women in uniform have found themselves in combat situations that are dangerous, they have not been deployed to Iraq to wage combat on the ground against ISIL. Their responsibility, their mission has been to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi security forces.\nNow, of course, there are some U.S. Special Operators that have been deployed to carry out raids against ISIL targets. Obviously that's a combat situation. But that is very different than the decision that was made by President Bush to deploy more than 100,000 U.S. forces on the ground in a sustained combat role where their principal responsibility was to seek out and engage the adversary in combat. The mission that has been given to U.S. forces is different. And we have gone to great lengths to try to help you and the American public understand with precision exactly what responsibilities the Commander-in-Chief has given them.\nThe reason that that precision is important is it's important for people to understand the different in approach, but it's also important for people to understand how much gratitude we should have for our men and women in uniform who are assuming a great burden, at great peril to themselves, to keep our country safe. Certainly the Commander-in-Chief has that gratitude, and hopefully every American does.\nQ: It's a pretty tough charge, though, using the word \"politics\" in this. Can you specifically respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I'm going to respond to Secretary Gates today.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, back on the Chinese aircraft incident. You said you would not ascribe a motive to that incident. But is there any doubt in the administration's mind that the incident was deliberate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this is exactly why we've got this established channel where U.S. military and diplomatic officials can consult with their counterparts in China and engage in a dialogue with them about this particular incident and give those Chinese officials an opportunity to explain from their perspective exactly what happened and try to prevent those kinds of dangerous incidents from occurring in the future. So that's why I'm hesitating to ascribe a motive. I'll let Chinese officials explain their actions, and I'm confident that they'll do that both publicly and privately.\nQ: Could you say whether this is the kind of incident President Obama would raise in his next conversation with President Xi?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that it necessarily would rise to that level. There have been a couple of high-profile incidents with --\nQ: The Russians.\nMR. EARNEST -- the Russians. And the President, in the immediate aftermath of one of those incidents, had a long phone call with President Putin and it didn't come up. I don't know if this kind of incident would rise to that level. It certainly wouldn't rise to the level of prompting proactively a call from the President to his Chinese counterpart, but it's hard for me to say whether or not it would come up in a call that was scheduled to discuss something else.\nQ: Last one. Can you say whether or not Chinese leaders have raised the issue of U.S. reconnaissance planes near their airspace operating in that area?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the concern that they have raised is about the kind of territorial disputes that have arisen in the South China Sea. And China makes some significant claims in that region of the world that are in dispute. And the United States has asserted that those disputes should be resolved through diplomacy. We've made clear both publicly and privately that the United States is not a claimant to any of those land features in the South China Sea, but we have encouraged those with competing claims, including China, to find a diplomatic resolution to those competing claims.\nTaka.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Former U.S. Marine working for the U.S. military base Kadena in Okinawa was arrested by Okinawa police after a Japanese woman's body was found. Are you concerned this incident will make worse relations between people in Okinawa and U.S. military base?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Taka, we've seen the reports and we're aware of the arrest of a U.S. citizen civilian in Okinawa, and we're following the case closely. You probably have seen the statement from Ambassador Kennedy on this issue. Our heartfelt sympathy and deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim. This is a terrible tragedy and an outrage, and we wish to express our deepest sorrow.\nThe United States is treating this situation with the utmost seriousness, and the United States military is cooperating fully with local authorities in their investigation. For additional details about that, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. They presumably could answer any questions you would have about any impact this could potentially have on the military presence in Okinawa, but I would not anticipate any sort of policy change.\nQ: The President is going to Japan next week, so will he talk about these kinds of issues?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry? He'll go to Japan next week. And what was the last part of your questions?\nQ: Will he talk about these issues when he goes to Japan? Will he talk about this military base issue?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if the conversation about this particular incident will occur. I would anticipate the President will have an opportunity to have a discussion with Prime Minister Abe, but I don't know whether or not this will be on the agenda.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On TPP, the ITC report came out late yesterday and it showed in their assessment that the TPP would boost American agriculture, boost the service sector, but actually have a slightly downward impact on U.S. manufacturing. Obviously, manufacturing has been a big selling point for the President in this, and this is showing that it would actually reduce manufacturing slightly. Is that a disappointment to you? Or do you agree with that assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things. I mean, the overall numbers are, as you point out, quite good. The U.S. annual real income would be boosted by $57 billion if TPP were to go into effect based on this independent analysis. And about two-thirds -- GDP would increase $42 billion. And about two-thirds of the GDP growth resulting from the TPP would go to American workers through wage increases and increased job opportunities. And that's how -- I think this provides additional evidence of how the TPP is consistent with the President's strategy of focusing on growing the U.S. economy from the middle out.\nI would say that these numbers would be even higher if they factored in the important success that we have enjoyed in negotiating a reduction in non-tariff barriers in the TPP agreement. This independent analysis did not fully account for the impact of the reduction in non-tariff barriers.\nAs it relates to the manufacturing sectors, the report shows very clearly that, under TPP, manufacturing employment and output do not decline from where they are now, but they would grow. And the ITC says very clearly that output in employment in each of the 56 sectors that they model will rise with TPP in effect.\nLet me give you a couple of examples. The fact that -- the ITC report shows that nearly $2 billion in increased auto exports is evidence of the impact of reducing the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on American automobiles. Malaysia imposes a 30 percent tax. And the reduction in those taxes would have a positive impact on U.S. workers and auto companies here at home.\nThe last thing I'll say about this is just that I think it's important to consider also that the ITC report didn't -- conducted their analysis essentially in isolation. Their analysis compares TPP to a baseline in which everything remains the same. One of our most powerful arguments, I think, about the need to move forward with implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is that if we do not, then China will certainly look to capitalize on opportunities in Southeast Asia that would not just preserve the status quo, but actually put American businesses at a further disadvantage.\nSo the question right now is not whether or not we should protect the status quo -- which many critics of the TPP are concerned about -- but rather, whether the United States would benefit from deeper engagement in the region and a trade agreement like the TPP that would raise labor standards, raise environmental standards, and raise human rights standards. Or are we going to subject U.S. businesses and U.S. workers to further disadvantage by effectively retreating from that region of the world?\nQ: Obviously your opponents, including Democrats in Congress, have been saying this would be bad for manufacturing. Are you concerned that this newer port will give them even more ammunition and decrease the likelihood that Congress will take this up this year?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not. Again, I think they would be challenged to make the case that the U.S. auto industry, for example, would be negatively affected by cutting the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on American autos. I also think they'd be challenged to make an argument that, given the status quo that they claim to be concerned about, that we should try to preserve it and not implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Because I haven't really heard them articulate a strategy for dealing with our increasingly globalized 21st century economy.\nIn fact, what's likely to happen if the United States withdraws from this region of the world -- we will see China seek to expand its influence. They won't be looking to raise environmental labor and human rights standards. If anything, they'll be looking to reduce them. That will put U.S. businesses and U.S. workers and the U.S. economy at a further disadvantage. And that's the essence of the case that we have made about the wisdom of moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\nQ: One other thing. You've now had a full 24 hours to study the list of Donald Trump's potential Supreme Court nominees. (Laughter.) Anything else you'd like to add about them?\nMR. EARNEST: You won't be surprised to hear that I have not devoted a single second of the last 24 hours to doing that. Plenty of others have and I'll let them weigh in with their opinions.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Has the President reached out or spoken to President Sisi or Hollande?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point. But if a contact like that occurs we'll definitely let you know.\nQ: And should we or should we not expect him to make an on-camera statement or comment about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't expect that today.\nQ: Should we or should we not expect the President at some point to address the Puerto Rican people directly or visit the island?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any presidential plans to visit the island, but if that changes we'll make sure -- we would make accommodations for you to join as well.\nQ: Would there be any interest in doing that, though?\nMR. EARNEST: The President did have the opportunity to campaign in Puerto Rico in 2008. I had the pleasure of joining him on that trip. It was actually about this time of year eight years ago. Seems like a long time ago now.\nQ: But given the economic crisis there, it would seem to be of interest to the President, certainly the Puerto Rican people, that he make a direct appeal, especially if this makes its way through Congress and something gets signed.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't have a trip right now to tell you about. Obviously Secretary Lew traveled to the island within the last couple of weeks. I understand that Secretary Castro is there this week, I believe -- is that right? So Secretary Castro is there this week. So there certainly have been a number of Obama administration officials, Cabinet-level officials who have visited Puerto Rico just within the last couple of weeks, to see firsthand the impact of the financial crisis on the island, on the livelihood of the 3 million Americans who live there.\nSo the President and the senior officials who are responsible for the domestic economy are quite concerned about the situation there. After all, that's why the administration put forward a plan back in October to try to address this situation, and ever since then, we've been trying to get Republicans to engage in a good-faith conversation about addressing the situation. We obviously were pleased that that lengthy process resulted in the introduction of bipartisan legislation last night.\nQ: It would be, by the way, the 40th bipartisan piece of legislation signed by the President this year. Were you aware of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, unfortunately, we're a long way from getting it signed. We certainly would like to see Congress act expeditiously to get this to the President's desk.\nQ: Let me circle back on something Karen asked you about, what former Secretary Gates had to say. He's been relatively consistent in his criticism of this notion that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. It is combat by any definition. Today you said you wanted to make certain that the American people understood the difference between having a combat mission and being engaged in combat. I want to give you another run at that, and I want to understand specifically, are you suggesting that unless they're on a combat mission, they are not in combat? Or are you saying even the ones who are not on a combat mission are engaged, in fact, in combat?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm trying to do, Kevin, is explain to the American people and to your viewers exactly what mission our men and women in uniform have been given by their Commander-in-Chief. I think what's important for people to first recognize is that the mission that our men and women in uniform have been given by President Obama is quite different than the mission that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers received from President Bush in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. That was a ground combat operation in which their principal responsibility was to go and seek out the enemy and engage them in combat.\nThe mission of most of our personnel in Iraq and in Syria now is different than that. Their principal responsibilities, setting aside those who are focused on counterterrorism and some of the special operators there that are conducting raids. The bulk of our servicemembers are engaged in a training, advice and assist mission. This means they are supporting Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq who are, themselves, responsible for taking the fight to ISIL in their own country. Those forces, those Iraqi forces, are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government and U.S. forces have been deployed in relatively small numbers to support their efforts, to offer them advice, including tactical advice, to carry out those operations and to maximize their likelihood of success.\nBut we have said on a number of occasions that that responsibility requires tremendous courage and professionalism because it's dangerous. Iraq is a dangerous place, and there have been situations in which U.S. military personnel have found themselves in combat situations when in the context of carrying out this training, advising and assist mission. That is why those soldiers that are deployed and given this role and given this mission are armed for combat, they are trained for combat, and some of them have had to engage in combat.\nTragically, I think at least three of them now have died in combat, and we owe them and their families a debt of gratitude for the tremendous sacrifice they have made for the safety and security of our country. Again, I know that our critics want to ascribe a variety of motives to this explanation. And what the Commander-in-Chief, his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his Secretary of Defense have all consistently done is try to be as precise and as clear as possible about what exactly the mission is that our men and women in uniform are pursuing in Iraq and in Syria.\nBob.\nQ: Josh, a quick follow-up, really. Since we brought up the fight against ISIS in Iraq, as they've been squeezed -- as ISIS has been squeezed in other parts of the country or wherever they've launched a series of suicide or car-bomb attacks, any number of them in Baghdad itself, does the United States have any kind of role in securing Baghdad right now that you know of?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Iraqi forces obviously do have a responsibility both to proactively go after ISIL and fight for their own country. They also have a responsibility to try to protect the Iraqi people from terrorist attacks that are perpetrated by ISIL extremists. So they are responsible for doing both. And our men and women in uniform that are providing training and are providing some advice and assistance are providing them that training, advice and assistance even as they try to perform both of those functions.\nQ: In Baghdad, you mean?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in Baghdad there are Iraqi security forces.\nQ: It's a big city, I know. I understand.\nMR. EARNEST: In Baghdad, for example, there are Iraqi security forces that are there to protect the city. Some of those forces have been trained by the United States and our coalition partners. That probably, I guess, is the most tangible example I can give you.\nMike.\nQ: Yeah, I want to follow up on TPP. The ITC report was a prerequisite for congressional consideration of the deal on the Hill. Can you just say what the White House preference is in terms of timing? Will you start the clock on that congressional proceedings now?\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, what we have said is that we'd consult with the Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the best strategy for getting the TPP agreement approved as soon as possible. So the White House has been in touch with Democrats and Republicans who are supportive of the agreement to develop a legislative strategy for moving forward.\nQ: And are you resigned to this probably -- I mean, there's only I think five or six weeks that they're in session before the long recess. Is this only going to be something that happens in the lame duck session at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. We're going to continue to consult about the best path forward and we would like to see Congress act soon to approve the agreement. And the case that we have made is consistent with the argument that the Chamber of Commerce and other influential Republican-leaning organizations have made, which is that every day that goes by is a missed opportunity for American businesses and American workers to benefit from this agreement.\nSo we're hopeful that we'll build the same bipartisan coalition that we built last year to give the President the authority necessary to negotiate this agreement, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to build a similar bipartisan coalition to approve the agreement.\nQ: And I noticed that the White House has been in touch with Democrats and Republicans on the Hill. I think Denis McDonough was up there this week. Can you say when the last time was that the President spoke directly with either the Speaker or to Senator McConnell?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't, Mike, primarily because we've preserved the President's ability to engage in private conversations. But I can just tell you as a general matter that our consultations on this issue have -- well, let me say it this way. Both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan have indicated on a number of occasions that they believe an agreement like this would be in the best interest of the United States and our economy. So it certainly makes sense that we would coordinate with them, even at the highest levels, on the path for legislative approval.\nSusan, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two things. While you were out here in the briefing, it seems like CNN -- I'm looking on Twitter here so I can't be quite sure -- is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early belief is that a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down. I'm wondering if you can confirm that they've found wreckage and whether that -- if you could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I saw some of that reporting before I walked out here and I don't have an intelligence assessment to share at this point.\nQ: Okay. The second question is a little more complicated. I'm wondering if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the President really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the administration -- there were some exceptions. But does he feel the same way about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the administration? That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up and be transparent about that disclosure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Susan, I don't have the details in front of me, but I know that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on his first day in office didn't just apply to individuals who might be considering employment in the federal government during the Obama administration; there were also commitments that incoming administration officials had to make about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government. And so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to former Obama administration officials.\nQ: Does the White House advise people leaving? Do they remind them of that and their requirements? Is there a process --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there is. As part of the out-boarding process, you're reminded of the commitments that you've made on the way in that would limit your job prospects on the way out. And look, many people have raised concerns about how historically there's been a revolving door between the federal government and K Street. And the President's efforts, again, that he initiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, both in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the government, but also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their way out.\nQ: It's not just K Street that these individuals are going to. I'm wondering if anybody left the White House that went to go on and lobby on behalf of engagement in Cuba, if -- and they're contacting administration officials, should they have registered to lobby?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I assume -- it sounds now like you're asking about a specific case, and why don't we just walk through the details and -- help you understand how the rules might apply in a particular case.\nQ: Sure. Luis Miranda left the White House. He went to the Trimpa Group. He did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on that issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there's no lobbying disclosure records to show for that. I have written about this, but we've talked about a lot -- there's been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative this week, but there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the -- and the timeline -- and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timeline and the transparency on those negotiations. That's why I'm asking.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can provide you some additional information. It sounds like -- I'm not sure that any of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a look.\nQ: To Luis Miranda specifically?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he doesn't work here anymore.\nQ: Right, so that's why --\nMR. EARNEST: So maybe you should go ask him.\nQ: Right, I've tried to contact him.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Is it important for the White House to have some level of -- on the Cuba issue -- to have had some level of surprise on that issue? Or I mean, is it the President's right and the White House's right to -- and the State Department -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a major initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another country?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I think that's entirely appropriate. And that certainly has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the United States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years. And when we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being unjustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensively in the past. When the United States was working behind the scenes with China to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon pollution in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiations I think were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States enjoyed significant benefits as a result.\nThose kinds of negotiations, that kind of diplomacy is often most effective when it's done behind the scenes, as you described it.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 1:35 P.M.

Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Today I have the privilege to present our Nation's highest honor for scientific and technological achievement: the National Medals of Science and the National Medals of Technology and Innovation.\nThe amount of brainpower in this room right now is astonishing. [Laughter] But when you talk to these brilliant men and women, it's clear the honor has not yet gone to their heads. They still put their lab coats [on; White House correction.] one arm at a time. [Laughter]\nJoining us to celebrate these achievements are Members of Congress; Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz, a pretty good scientist himself; my science adviser, John Holdren; the Director of the National Science Foundation, France Còrdova; the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Michelle Lee; and Jim Rathmann from the National Medals of Science and Technology Foundation. I want to thank them for all the work that they do each year to help us organize and honor the scientists and innovators in this great nation of ours.\nNow, we are engaging in a lot of science and tinkering here at the White House. [Laughter] We've got Astronomy Night. We got Hack-a-thons. We got Code-a-thons. We have Science Fairs, Maker Faires. It is fun. I love this stuff. I get to test out some of the cool stuff that ends up here in the White House. At this year's Science Fair, one ninth—9-year-old, named Jacob Leggette, turned the tables on me and suggested that we needed to start a kids' advisory group—[laughter]—so that young people can help us understand what's interesting to them when it comes to STEM education, which I thought was a pretty good idea. [Laughter]\nSo today I can announce that we are launching a \"Kid Science Advisers\" campaign for young scientists and innovators to send in their suggestions for what we should be doing to support science and technology and inspire the next generation of scientists and innovators. So those young people out there who are listening, go to our website. We're going to be looking for some advisers, some advice. [Laughter]\nThe real reason we do this, as I've said before, is to teach our young people that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl or the NCAA tournament that deserves a celebration; that we want the winners of science fairs, we want those who have invented the products and lifesaving medicines and are engineering our future to be celebrated as well. Because immersing young people in science, math, engineering, that's what's going to carry the American spirit of innovation through the 21st century and beyond.\nThat's what the honorees who are here today represent. Many of them came from humble or ordinary beginnings, but along the way, someone or something sparked their curiosity. Someone brought them their first computer. Someone introduced them to a lab. A child in their lives needed specialized medical help. And because they lived in an America that fosters curiosity and invests in education and values science as important to our progress, they were able to find their calling and do extraordinary things. So there are few better examples for our young people to follow than the Americans that we honor today. Just to take a couple of examples: Shirley Ann Jackson, who is part of my science advisory group, grew up right here in Washington, DC. Hers was a quiet childhood. Her first homemade experiment involved, I understand, collecting and cataloging bumblebees in her backyard. [Laughter] Two events happened that would not only change our country's course, but Shirley's: In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal; and the Soviets launched Sputnik up in the sky, sparking a space race. As Shirley put it, \"Those two events in history changed my life for good.\"\nShe went on to become the first African American to earn a doctorate in physics from MIT, the second woman to do so anywhere in America. And over the years, Dr. Jackson has revolutionized the way science informs public policy from rethinking safety at our nuclear plants to training a new generation of scientists and engineers that looks more like the diverse and inclusive America that she loves.\nThen you have Mark Humayan, who immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 9 years old. When his diabetic grandmother lost her vision, he began studying to become an ophthalmologist, hoping he could save the sight of others. Mark helped create the \"Argus II,\" a \"bionic eye\" that has restored vision to patients who've been blind for up to 50 years. He says the moment when he witnessed someone seeing light and shapes, someone experiencing the miracle of sight for the first time in decades—those moments have been some of the happiest and most rewarding of his professional career. In his words—and I think no pun is intended—\"There wasn't a dry eye in the operating room.\" [Laughter]\nGrowing up in Chicago, Mary-Claire King's dad would sit with her in front of the TV for Cubs and White Sox games—[laughter]—and make up story problems for her to solve about the players on the field. She just thought that's how everyone watched baseball, which explains why, when a college adviser encouraged her to take a genetics course, she said, \"I couldn't believe anything could be so fun.\" [Laughter]\nBut every single American should be grateful for Mary-Claire King's path. We're glad that she thought it was fun, because at a time when most scientists believed that cancer was caused by viruses, she relentlessly pursued her hunch that certain cancers were linked to inherited genetic mutations. This self-described \"stubborn\" scientist kept going until she proved herself right. Seventeen years of work later, Mary-Claire discovered a single gene that predisposes women to breast cancer. And that discovery has empowered women and their doctors with science to better understand the choices that they make when it comes to their health and their future.\nSo these are just three examples of the remarkable stories that are represented here today. They illustrate why this is such an extraordinary moment to be a scientist in this country. America's progress in science and technology has countless revolutionary discoveries within our reach: new materials designed atom by atom, new forms of clean energy, new breakthroughs in treating cancer and ending the wait for organ transplants; private space flight, a planned human mission to Mars, a NASA probe that broke free from the solar system 3 years ago, and it just kept on going. That's some of what America can do.\nThat's why we're constantly pushing Congress to fund the work of our scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and dreamers to keep America on the cutting edge.\nAs President, I'm proud to honor each of you for your contributions to our nations. As an American, I'm proud of everything that you've done to contribute to that fearless spirit of innovation that's made us who we are and that doesn't just benefit our citizens, but benefits the world. We're very proud of what you've done. So congratulations to all of you.\nWith that, let's read the citations and present the awards.\n[At this point, Lt. Col. Andrew C. Steadman, USA, Army Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Steven M. Schreiber, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President.]\nLet's give another big round of applause to our honorees. [Applause] Yay! Very proud of them.\nAnd let's give a big round of applause to my Military Aide, who had to read those citations—[laughter]—with a lot of pretty complicated phrases in them. You were practicing, weren't you? [Laughter] The—well, it just goes to show we can all learn science. [Laughter] Science rocks.\nSo thank you very much, everybody. Please enjoy the reception. Congratulations to our honorees. Have a wonderful afternoon.

I apologize for the delay. One quick announcement, and then we'll go ahead and move to your questions.\nI wanted to let you all know that as of Sunday, it will have been 67 days since the President fulfilled his constitutional responsibility and presented the American people with an exceptional nominee for our nation's highest court, Chief Judge Merrick Garland.\nSince 1975, the average period of time from nomination by the President to confirmation by the United States Senate for a Supreme Court nominee has been 67 days. In that time, Chief Judge Garland has met with 58 senators, has sent a detailed questionnaire to the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including over 2,200 pages of information. And today he stands ready to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on camera, under oath, to answer any questions those senators may have about his nomination to the highest court.\nYou may have seen last week, Senator McConnell said on the floor of the Senate that \"we are going to give the Senate every opportunity to do the basic work of government this year.\" He said the elections are not an excuse for people *not to do their work. And you know what, we couldn't agree more. We believe very strongly that the Senate ought to do its job and fulfill its constitutional duty to advise and consent on this nominee.\nBy nominating a highly qualified individual, someone with more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history, the President has done his job, and Chief Judge Merrick Garland continues to do his. As of Sunday, it will be past time for Republicans to do theirs.\nWith that, Kathleen, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: I'm going to start with the EgyptAir crash. Do you have any update on U.S. assistance, and any update on who is responsible?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kathleen, as Josh mentioned yesterday, our thoughts and prayers of everyone here at the White House are with the families of those who were onboard Egypt Flight 804. Obviously the uncertainty and impending sense of loss that the loved ones of those who were on that plane must be experiencing is unthinkable for us here.\nThe President continues to receive updates on this. He was first informed yesterday morning by his Homeland Security Advisor and Counterterrorism Advisor, Lisa Monaco. He was updated throughout the day yesterday on this. And then, this morning, as you saw, the President received his Presidential Daily Briefing.\nWithout violating the confidences of that briefing, I think it's a safe bet to say that this topic came up.\nI can tell you that the President has directed his staff to make sure that administration officials are reaching out to their counterparts in both Egypt and France, and to stand up resources should they be requested. Already, the Navy has sent a P-3 Orion aircraft. That aircraft is above the Mediterranean right now, assisting in the search.\nQ: And do you have any new information on who you think -- whether or not it was a terrorist attack?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, for us, it's too early to definitively say what may have caused this. We continue to pursue all potential factors that have contributed. Obviously the Egyptian authorities are in the lead here, but we stand ready to assist in any way we can.\nQ: Okay. I also wanted to move on to the Russian defense minister's claim that -- is proposing joint airstrikes with Russia against al-Nusra. Are those negotiations or discussions going on with the U.S. --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Kathleen, as you know, this is not the first time Russia has proposed enhancing their military cooperation with the United States. Right now, that cooperation is basically in de-confliction talks through a very specific channel at the Department of Defense, based on both countries' activities in Syria. But we believe that if Russia wants to do something to take on al-Nusra and ISIL, the first thing on their to-do list is to make sure that the Assad regime is abiding by the Cessation of Hostilities in Syria. Clearly, the turmoil and chaos there is what provides a fertile breeding ground for ISIL to conduct its operations.\nSo our goal is for Russia to urge its patron, Assad, to abide by the Cessation of Hostilities. But we're not going to comment on any further steps at this point.\nQ: That's not something -- you're not ruling out the possibility that you would conduct joint strikes?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, we have two priorities. One is to make sure that the United States -- Counter-ISIL Coalition is doing everything we can to apply maximum pressure against the threat posed by ISIL. Second, when it comes to Russia's involvement, they have an opportunity to help provide a political solution in Syria. That is a political solution -- it's going to be the only resolution to the crisis in Syria as we know it. And in order to get to that political solution there needs to be much more stability on the ground. That stability on the ground can only be achieved if the Assad regime abides by the cessation of hostilities.\nOne of the main levers on the Assad regime is Russia. And so if they want to play a role in increasing pressure against Nusra and against ISIL, that's how to do it.\nQ: Thanks. One last one on the President's upcoming trip. Do you know if he plans to, or the White House plans to announce any additional assistance to Vietnam with regard to Agent Orange or exploded mines, landmines?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kathleen, I think as you know, the President is very excited for this trip. We leave tomorrow afternoon. We have a whole lot on the agenda. We'll be spending three days in Vietnam. This is the first-ever trip of its kind. As you know, President Clinton visited Vietnam to announce normalization of relations. President Bush went to Vietnam for an international forum. But President Obama will be spending three days on the ground to deepen and strengthen our partnership with that country. We'll be focusing on expanding economic cooperation, security cooperation. We'll be focused on people-to--people engagement.\nAs you know, Vietnam has a rapidly expanding middle class, and for us, that's important for a couple of different reasons. But at the top of the list is that provides a marketplace for U.S. goods and services. So the President is going to use this as an opportunity to advance U.S. interests abroad, including our economic interests. That's why the President worked so hard to gain agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's why he is pushing that so hard domestically as well.\nSo I believe we will have a few more announcements along the road over the next week. And those of you who are joining us, we'll keep you updated.\nJeff.\nQ: Eric, following up on the Russia question, do you or does the White House have any sense of the motivation behind Russia's proposal?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't. I'm not going to sit here and speculate on what our counterparts in Russia are saying. I think that you've seen Russia show an eagerness to cooperate with us militarily. This is not something that's new. But for us, again, we principally keep in a very specific lane about de-conflicting our activities within Syria, and we don't have any new plans to change that.\nAgain, our view is that if they want to do something about ISIL and Nusra, which is their stated goal, then the best thing they can do is help provide for a stable Iraq -- a stable Syria, and make sure that Assad abides by the cessation of hostilities.\nQ: Speaking of Iraq, is there* a reaction to the violence in the Green Zone today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We have seen those reports, and clearly our first priority is the safety and security of our personnel on the ground there. We are in close contact with the Iraqis regarding the current situation, and we are standing by to support them as necessary. Obviously, the situation is dynamic and evolving. I was briefed just minutes ago before coming out here. So the Iraqi government will have the latest information, but we're going to stay in touch with them and monitor it closely.\nQ: And lastly, Donald Trump today said that Prime Minister Cameron had invited him for a visit. Number 10 Downing Street said maybe not so fast, although they also said it was standard for the Prime Minister to meet with the candidates of both parties. Any reaction to that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't. Obviously, the President was just in London with some of you. We had a great visit there. The partnership between the United Kingdom and the United States is one that's special and unique. We deeply value our relationship. The President had a great visit with Prime Minister Cameron.\nIf I was feeling looser, I'd recall a 2012 visit by a different Republican presidential candidate, but I don't do that right now.\nQ: Shows remarkable restraint. (Laughter.) You say that the United States government stands ready to assist, which sounds like the posture we were in yesterday. Has Egypt requested assistance? Have they accepted it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So I don't have specific conversations to read out to you. Typically these are conversations and discussions that happen with my colleagues at the Department of Defense and Department of State, and, to the extent appropriate, Department of Homeland Security. So I can tell you that the Navy has already deployed an Orion P-3 aircraft. That plane is over the Mediterranean right now, assisting in the investigation. And if there are other assets that are deployed, we'll let you know.\nQ: But the government hasn't asked for it yet?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't want to read out private conversations, but we stand ready to assist. And that's a directive directly from the President.\nQ: Egypt is sending the message that this crash was not their fault because the plane originated in Paris. The last time -- we had Metrojet -- the focus I think was on Egypt, and they were reluctant to say that they had a little bit of culpability in it. Do you buy the Egypt argument that they're not responsible because this plane originated in Paris?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I understand the inclination to sort of speculate. I think our first priority is helping the authorities find a plane. And so until that happens, it's going to be hard for us to reach any definitive conclusion on what happened. So I'm going to reserve judgment.\nQ: Just a couple other questions. General Dunford has been quoted as predicting a \"long mission to Libya in the fight against ISIS.\" Can you give us some idea of what that mission might look like?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can. Joe, as you know, this administration is focused on supporting the Government of National Accord in Tripoli as it strives to restore stability and security to Libya and to serve the Libyan people. We commend the Prime Minister there and the leadership of the new government for taking steps in the process of restoring a unified governance to that country.\nThe United States -- and I think this goes to your question -- would welcome a request from the Libyan government to strengthen the capabilities of the presidential guard there, embedded forces supporting and aligned with the Government of National Accord.\nWe will work with members of the international community on such a request. And, as General Dunford indicated today, it is possible that NATO could have a supportive role to help build Libyan capacity to provide security and combat ISIL. Clearly, that's a goal shared by the Prime Minister there, by the government there, and that's something we stand ready to assist with.\nQ: Are we talking about a lead role here?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think obviously combatting the threat posed by ISIL is something that the United States has led on throughout the world. We've assembled a coalition of countries around the world. And so the President has asserted that this is a priority for us. So we're happy to entertain a request from the Libyan government, but I don't know if it's gotten to that level of detail yet.\nQ: And last question. The President is going to be promoting TPP in Asia. When you think about it, Sanders, Clinton, even Trump have also been opposed to TPP. What's the calculation over here as far as the likelihood of it getting anywhere, given the fact that all three of the presidential candidates appear to be opposed?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, only one of them has a vote in Congress right now. And we continue to work with our partners in Congress and the leadership in both the House and the Senate, and we believe that this is something that should pass because it's good for American workers.\nAs I mentioned, Vietnam has a rapidly growing middle class. We want to make sure that American goods and services and American companies can service that middle class with the products made in the U.S. of A. So we believe that this is a good deal for America's workers. We also believe that it -- well, we know, because it's in the text, that it will reduce tariffs for American exports.\nIt's important that American exports are able to get into those markets. And above all else, if we don't set the rules of the road in the economies in this region, China is going to. So we believe that it's in American interest for TPP to pass. We believe that there's a reason that Trade Promotion Authority passed the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. And we're going to continue to push for that.\nI'll just give you a few more statistics in case it's helpful. In Vietnam, currently U.S. auto exports face a 70 percent tariff. Construction equipment faces tariffs as high as 59 percent. And auto parts face a 32 percent tariff. In Japan, currently U.S. beef exports face tariffs of nearly 40 percent, and leather footwear faces tariffs of up to 189 percent.\nSo we believe this is a deal that represents not only the future of the interconnected global economy but also a potential for American goods and services to be sold and purchased around the world.\nChris.\nQ: Eric, this week, after approving a defense bill that would allow federal contractors to discriminate against LGBT workers, the House yesterday defeated an amendment from Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney that would have voided that language. At first it looked as though the amendment would have passed, but then seven House Republicans changed their votes and the amendment failed 213-212. Does the White House think House leadership strong-armed those seven lawmakers to change their votes?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I saw that episode yesterday, Chris, and I read the reports afterwards. As you know, earlier this week we put out a very detailed Statement of Administration Policy explaining our objections to this piece of legislation. I'm happy to walk you through a few of them now. But the broadest way to put this is that this bill inserts obstacles in the way of our Defense Department trying to modernize our military forces. We often hear Republican rhetoric, especially on the campaign trail, talking about how our military has been eviscerated. And what's going to eviscerate them is if the Defense Department doesn't have the resources and equipment and capabilities they need to modernize and make sure that we have the military needed to face down 21st century threats.\nThis bill also includes what we've called a funding gimmick called the Overseas Contingency Operation. This is something Secretary Carter himself has called \"gambling with war-fighting money\" at a time of war. We think that's an illegitimate way to fund our government, and does a disservice to our troops.\nSecond, this is a piece of legislation that restricts our ability to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. That is a facility that Democrats and Republicans purportedly share the goal of closing for a whole host of reasons -- namely, it's a recruiting tool for those who wish to do us harm. We've seen the prison at Guantanamo Bay repeatedly used in propaganda materials from terrorist organizations. We also know the prison at Guantanamo Bay is exorbitantly expensive. It costs about $445 million a year to operate. We can do this -- we can keep our country secure in a much more fiscally responsible way.\nAnd the least reason is it's inconsistent with our values. This is something that this President has spoken out on for many years now, and it's also something that, again, Democrats and Republicans have echoed as well.\nAnd as you point out, one of the other objectionable pieces of this legislation is that it would make it easier to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. That has nothing to do with our national defense. I can't for the life of me figure out why Republicans would want to insert an ideological rider into a defense bill, let alone one that is mean-spirited like that.\nSo I did see what happened on the floor of the House of Representatives yesterday. I know that the measure by Congressman Maloney was on track to pass and then it failed. We believe that overriding the President's work to make sure that defense contractors don't discriminate based on sexual orientation -- trying to override that is misguided and ill-advised. It's also mean-spirited. It's also inconsistent with American values of equality and tolerance.\nQ: But do you believe that House leadership instigated the spectacle that took place on the House floor yesterday?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can't speak to the machinations of the House floor yesterday.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. On Zika funding, the President was fairly critical just now, or this morning, of both the House and the Senate bill as not being enough. I guess do you have a veto threat to give us today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I came out here just with a ballpoint pen. (Laughter.)\nLook, as we have said, we believe -- we have issued a veto threat on the House bill. We believe that's woefully inadequate. It not only underfunds this urgent priority dramatically, but it also, as we say, robs Peter to pay Paul. It takes away crucial funding from our fight against Ebola -- a fight and an effort that you all remember vividly -- because I do, sitting in that chair, as you all asked questions -- you all asked very legitimate questions about what we were doing to combat it.\nSo we believe we shouldn't take our eye off that ball just because a new public health threat is emerging. We can do both. And there are U.S. government personnel on the ground in Africa, still working on that, very earnestly, and there is now a new threat that we should be combatting at the same time.\nAs you know, the President asked three months ago, now, for $1.9 billion for Congress to allocate that. The House has fallen woefully short. The Senate made a little bit more progress. It's not often that we invoke the junior Senator from Florida, who recently ran for President, but he put it better than I could. He said, admittedly, this is a request that comes from the President, but it's grounded in reality from our public health officials.\nSo we believe that if members of Congress want to make decisions on the merits, they should look at the facts and they should look at science. They have a week left before they take another week-long recess. They should get to work and fund this request. There's no reason for delay.\nQ: I hear you and the White House has sent that message many times before. So would the President veto $1.1 billion Senate bill as not being enough?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Cheryl, obviously that is short of what the President's request is. And the President didn't just pick a number out of the air -- the President sent up a detailed package -- again, not just a press release, not just a letter, not just a set of talking points, but a detailed analysis grounded in facts and the latest information from our public health officials, laying out this request.\nAnd this isn't something that can be subject to partisan bickering, and it shouldn't be something where Congress just passes the buck. We're talking about the health and public safety of pregnant women and children. And Congress need to get a bill to the President's desk for a signature as soon as possible.\nQ: You didn't answer her question.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, the Senate bill is something that falls short of the President's funding request. They made more progress in the Senate than they did in the House. I'll remind you that the Senate bill is bipartisan.\nQ: Would he veto it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, the Senate bill is more progress -- allocated more funding, doesn't rob Peter to pay Paul, so we're more encouraged by what the Senate did. But there's a long way to go, because clearly the House and the Senate are in vastly different places. I would also note that the junior Senator from Florida felt strongly that the $1.9 billion should be fully funded, so I'm curious why the House members who represent that great state, the \"Sunshine State,\" aren't also in sync with their Senate leadership, their Senate colleagues, because it seems like if I was a member of Congress from Florida, then I would be doing everything I could to make sure that my constituents are protected from this.\nJames.\nQ: A few different subjects, but just staying with Zika funding for the moment. I guess a simple way to ask this question is, why is there no veto threat against the Senate measure?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, we should be clear here that the Senate passed a bill that's $1.1 billion. That is quite a bit short of the $1.9 billion that our public health professionals tell us we need. So we believe it's a step in the right direction. We are encouraged by bipartisan support on that front. It's rare in Washington these days we get bipartisan support, so we are encouraged by the steps they took. But we still continue to urge Congress to fund the President's request. We feel like anything short of that will be insufficient.\nAnd I am happy to walk you through some of the actions that we could be taking as soon as that money is allocated. For example, without the funding, vaccine development is getting delayed, diagnostic testing is getting delayed, funding for mosquito control could slow or even halt, and states don't have the funding they need to fight Zika. This is a request that comes from governors, James, and that is why we want to make sure that those states are getting the resources they need to combat this.\nI'll say one more thing -- that we know that at some point there's going to be a media -- let's say a heightened level of interest in this and what is the federal government doing to respond. And when that day comes, I want you to remember the preceding three months of Congress's inaction on this.\nQ: So, to that point, listening to the President this morning, there seemed to be kind of a passivity in the sense that he was saying Congress needs to get something to my desk. And he was urging members of the public to contact their lawmakers to exert that kind of pressure on them for that purpose. But I just wonder, where is the President's own outreach on this? Why isn't he bringing people into the Oval Office for serious conference sessions with himself? And if it's so urgent, why isn't he finding $1.9 billion somewhere within his discretionary funds in order to meet this emergency?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'll take the last part of your question, first, which is the President was able to retrieve some funds that had been previously allocated to fight Ebola. We maxed out on that. We scraped the bottom of the barrel. So that money has been reallocated to fight Zika, but we can't take any more of those funds without endangering our effort to combat Ebola.\nTo the first part of your question, I would just point you to this February 22nd proposal that we sent to Congress, outlining our plan. This wasn't a haphazard package that we put together in a few minutes or a few hours. This was a detailed proposal. It includes guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. It also includes guidance from our public health officials at the CDC and NIH, and goes into detail about why we need these funds.\nQ: But why isn't he working Congress in the manner of a Lyndon Johnson? Why isn't he getting people in the Oval Office, saying, you're not going anywhere until we have this money for what he himself called an emergency back in February?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I wouldn't stipulate to those facts. I can tell you that we don't always read out every conversation the President has, but I can assure you there is not a member of Congress who is not aware of the request that we have before them. And I can also tell you that White House officials continue to remain engaged with members of Congress to get this done.\nQ: Very quickly -- the Green Zone issue raised earlier -- should the fact of this violence in that particular area lead people to conclude the central government in Iraq is in very serious trouble?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm not sure that's the conclusion that we would draw. Our conclusion is that Iraq does need a stable and functional government, and we need that for a couple of different reasons. First and foremost is, only with a functional government can we have active partners on the ground to pursue the fight against ISIL. So our first priority is making sure that Prime Minister Abadi has a functional government. Sometimes that's going to include dissent and peaceful protests. But as I talked about, this situation is dynamic and ongoing, so we're going to continue to monitor it closely. But we stand ready to provide any support and assistance we can.\nQ: Last question. In advance of the President's trip to Vietnam -- Mr. Obama was, if my math is correct, 14 at the time of the United States' final withdrawal from Saigon. And I just wonder if you could speak, to the extent possible for you, how the Vietnam War and the post-Vietnam period shaped this President's view of America and the world.\nMR. SCHULTZ: James, I think that's a very good question, and I think you're going to hear the President talk about that over the next couple of days, so I don't want to get ahead of him. I will say the President is very much focused on this trip. This is one that has been in the works for a while and it's a trip that he wanted to make. He felt very strongly about this. And we're spending three days -- we're spending three days on the ground. That's a lot for one country, normally, on these trips.\nThe President is not only looking forward to speaking with the leadership in Vietnam and government leaders, but he's also going to be speaking with young people. He's going to have a town hall where he takes questions from young people. He's going to meet with business leaders and civic leaders. And he's going to talk about how far we've come since those days in the decades since the time you mentioned to now, and how far our relationship has come.\nAs I mentioned, it was President Clinton who decided to begin the normalization process with Vietnam. Since then, Presidents of both parties have worked to deepen that relationship. But the President sees this as a pivotal opportunity to expand that partnership, expand collaboration on security and economic cooperation.\nAnd I want to be clear that he's also going to make a push for human rights. Vietnam has made some progress on this front, but they have a long way to go. So I'd expect the President to speak about that not only in his public remarks but also in private when he meets with the leadership.\nQ: But in your own time around this President, has that been something that you've been able to observe, this idea that he was very much shaped by the post-Vietnam experience in some ways?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't want to get ahead of how the President is going to talk about this. I believe he wrote some about this in his book, and so I'd refer you that. But I also think this was a consequential time for the President, but it was a consequential time for the United States of America. And this will harken back to a very emotional time for the United States and a time where our leaders were tested and tried and challenged. And I think the President is going to -- that will all be included in the President's reflections over the next few days. And I want to make sure you know that Secretary Kerry, who obviously has his own unique story, will be joining us in Vietnam for those three days. So we look forward to hearing from him as well.\nYes, Mark.\nQ: Eric, do you know if the update that President Obama got on the Zika virus, whether it included discussion of the risks to U.S. athletes planning on going to the Summer Games in Brazil?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mark, I don't know if the discussion this morning included that piece. I can tell you the President was updated on both where things stand and sort of the status of what we know from our latest public health information, but also the latest on our response to this effort. As I mentioned, we were able to allocate some funds from the Ebola effort to this, but we're also being stymied because Congress refuses to act for ways that escape my comprehension.\nQ: And yesterday, the U.S. swimming team announced it was moving its training camp from Puerto Rico to Atlanta because of the Zika virus. Is that something that came up in the briefing?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't know if the Olympics came up. I understand the interest in this, but as we have said, we defer to people's personal decisions made with their doctors.\nThanks, Mark.\nKaren.\nQ: Does the White House have confidence that the Egyptians can handle this -- taking the lead in the recovery effort with the plane and the investigation?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Karen, as we've said, the Egyptians are in the lead on this. We stand ready to support. I know they're working closely with our French counterparts. And so we want to make sure that that investigation is as comprehensive and as fast as possible. So that's why the President directed his team to make resources available. But I don't know have updates for you on the sort of status of that investigation.\nQ: Would the White House rather see France take the lead on this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard that determination made. Obviously, the Egyptian authorities right now are in the lead of this investigation, and we want it to proceed without delay.\nQ: Two more. I think you had said yesterday -- Josh had said there hadn't been conversations yet with the Presidents of Egypt and France. Is there any update on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any new calls to read out to you, but if that were to happen, we'll let you know.\nQ: And one more quick one. The TSA Administrator said today -- he alluded that there could be potential changes coming to the TSA, that there might even be an increase in staff or increase in funding to handle any changes that would be made in the wake of this plane incident. Is the TSA prepared with staffing and funding? And what did he mean? What would that look like?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, it was the TSA Administrator, so you should check in with the TSA. They're best prepared to sort of answer the details of their operational decisions. I can tell you that, last week, Secretary Johnson, our Secretary of Homeland Security -- which TSA is a component of -- directed TSA to take several steps to address the long security lines. And so we are always making sure that we're constantly balancing to make sure that people's air travel remains unfettered while keeping them safe. So you should check in with them on that.\nObviously, our first priority is making sure that people are safe. TSA must continue its rigorous security screenings and we're not going to lower our standards for the sake of convenience.\nChip.\nQ: Can I follow up on Mark's questions? More generally, was there -- I don't know if you were in the room, but was there discussion in there of people restricting their travel to certain areas, generally?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Chip, I was not in the room. I know the President spoke at the bottom of the meeting, so I'm not sure we're going to have any more of an expanded readout on that. Those travel warnings are typically issued by the CDC, so if they have any updates on what they're advising the American people, you might want to check with them.\nBut our belief is that federal, state and local partners should be working together to limit the impact of this virus. But right now they don't have the resources they need, and that's a real shame. And that's why the President is going to continue to make the public case that Congress should pass this bill. And it's also why White House officials remain engaged with members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate so that Congress can get its act together and get this bill to the President's desk.\nQ: I asked Josh yesterday about Puerto Rico and the bill that just passed, and specifically the minimum wage requirement in the bill that would allow a reduction in the minimum wage in Puerto Rico. To sort of follow up on that, why did the White House not fight harder to not have that be a part of the final package? Especially since the White House made such a big deal out of increasing the minimum wage, why not fight harder on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Just want to take it -- I don't think the bill passed. I think it was just introduced, right? So we actually believe that, given that it hasn't passed -- I don't even think it's passed committee yet -- we believe there is still time for those provisions to come out and we would strongly urge members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate to do just that.\nAgain, Josh laid out the scenario yesterday of the 18- or 19-year-old Puerto Rican making minimum wage. It doesn't seem to make much sense that, A, they bear the brunt of poor fiscal decisions that were made by people they don't even know. And it also doesn't make a lot of sense that if we're trying to grow the economy and stabilize the economy in Puerto Rico that they can't even make a livable wage.\nSo we do believe those provisions are misguided. We are disappointed the bill includes those unhelpful measures. I will say they're better than the original proposal, which I believe they're now temporary. But we ultimately believe they should come out.\nQ: Does this run the risk if this overall package is successful in sort of turning around and helping the Puerto Ricans get out of their economic troubles that people who say that the minimum wage should not be raised will have a new piece of evidence, pointing at Puerto Rico saying we reduced the minimum wage there and it worked, and we could do that in the case of the entire nation?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, let's just separate out those two issues. First, on Puerto Rico, we absolutely would have preferred a bill without the minimum wage and the overtime protections that you mentioned, but we do believe this is a bill that both Democrats and Republicans can support. This is not a bailout. We're encouraged to see the House introduce this legislation that ultimately provides Puerto Rico with the tools they need to address the crisis, harming 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico.\nThe administration made clear I believe almost a year ago that any legislation to address the crisis in Puerto Rico must provide a workable and comprehensive restructuring authority with appropriate oversight that respects Puerto Rico's self-governance. And we also said at the time that only bipartisan congressional action can end this crisis. So that's why we urged members to stand firm against the special interests attempting to undermine this essential legislation and act without delay.\nIn terms of the issue of the minimum wage across this country, clearly the American workers need and deserve a raise. We've talked frequently about how to give American workers more money in their pocket, earn a livable wage and earn a wage that is commensurate with what they're working. The President announced recently new rules to make sure that Americans were paid fairly for the work they were putting in.\nBut there is probably nothing else on the table that would have more of an impact than if Congress were to raise the minimum wage. This would help middle-class families around the country. The President believes -- and I think his record for the past seven or eight years affirms -- that when we grow the economy from the middle class out, everyone wins. Raising the minimum wage is not just something that we believe, but I believe we're up to about 17 or 18 different states that have taken action on their own, and we've seen private companies take action on their own. They believe -- those companies -- and you should check with them -- have said that when they pay their workers a better wage then that increases productivity in their own bottom lines.\nSo we don't really understand why Congress is so dug in on this, why Congress doesn't want to lift wages for American workers. So you should ask them what their rationale is. But we we're going to continue to press hard and do everything we can, even while Congress is dug in. And that's why I think you've seen a number of states push this with our support and a number of private companies. And cities, too, actually.\nQ: On the Nigerian schoolgirls, the Nigerian government just announced that they have conducted an operation that rescued several women, including a second one of the Nigerian schoolgirls, in the last week. Was the U.S. involved at all in the operation? And do you have any reaction to it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can tell you that we are aware of the reports and we do await official confirmation from the Nigerian government. Unfortunately, Boko Haram's impact goes well beyond the Chibok girls. We are equally concerned about the thousands of other kidnapping victims of Boko Haram and the more than 2 million who have been forced to flee their homes.\nThe United States supports the Nigerian efforts to bring about the safe recovery of all of those kidnapped, and we call for all hostages held by Boko Haram to be immediately released without preconditions.\nIn terms of the United States' role, we are a strategic partner with Nigeria and we continue to work closely on all security matters. And we offered our assistance and resources to bring about the safe recovery of all of those kidnapped by Boko Haram.\nGoyal.\nQ: Thank you. Two questions. One, President said that if you harm the U.S. sooner or later you will regret it. And he was referring to Osama bin Laden's after five years. Now, has anything changed in the last five years after the President got Osama bin Laden? And those who were protecting him and keeping him for the last 10 years -- have they brought to justice, or anything changed between the U.S. and the 10 years in that country and five years --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Goyal, I think what the President was talking about was terrorists who either aim to do us harm or who commit acts of violence or terrorism against us. And you're right, the President has a strong record that if you commit an act of violence or terrorism against us, we will stop at nothing to find you. Osama bin Laden is one example, but I believe the Defense Department briefed yesterday the latest in our fight against ISIL, and I believe the Defense Department laid out that over 120 mid-to-high-value leaders of that organization have been taken off the battlefield. So I think that's what the President had in mind.\nQ: Mr. Fareed Zakaria also, CNN, in his show, he said that -- why do they hate us? If the President had been ever asked this, why they hate us. It means he was -- harming the U.S. but they still hate the U.S. Why?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I did not see Mr. Zakaria's show. I try and catch that when I can, but I must have missed that particular segment. I believe that the President has worked hard to build relationships around the world. That was a priority for him over the past seven, eight years.\nAnd look at this trip. We're going to go to Vietnam. It's the first-ever trip of its kind -- where the President is going to spend three days on the ground, both meeting with the government, the leaders of that country, but also with young people, with entrepreneurs, with business leaders in order to deepen the ties between the two countries. And then he's going to travel to Japan.\nBoth of those countries we have a difficult past with, but if you look at the preceding decades, we've built strong relationships. Japan is now one of our closest allies in that region. We do a whole lot of business with them, both in military cooperation, maritime security, economic cooperation.\nAnd so the President is absolutely looking forward to deepening those relationships. Those are the fundamental goals of this trip, alongside advancing U.S. national security interests.\nQ: Fareed Zakaria was talking about ISIL and terrorists and why they hate the U.S., why they hate --\nMR. SCHULTZ: You'll have to ask them why they say what they do.\nQ: And if I may, quickly, as far as Prime Minister Modi's visit to the White House is concerned, Indian American community and the Congress both are waiting for an address to the Congress. Anything new from the White House as far as the visit is concerned?\nMR. SCHULTZ: No. As you saw, this morning we were pleased to announce that Prime Minister Modi of India will visit the White House on Tuesday, June 7. This is going to be a visit that highlights the deepening of the U.S.-India relationship in key areas since the President's visit to New Delhi in January of 2015. The President looks forward to discussing progress made on climate change, on our clean energy partnership, on security and defense cooperation, and, of course, our economic growth proposals -- priorities.\nSo I think we'll have more to talk about on that visit in the coming weeks. But the President is absolutely looking forward to this visit.\nQ: Is this a state visit?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't believe so, no.\nJohn, do you have a question?\nQ: Back on Zika. I want to try this a different way. Given the bipartisan support for the Senate bill, would the President sign something -- would he sign the Senate bill or something very similar?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, we sent up a proposal about three months ago, February 22nd -- so in two days it will be -- maybe that's the anniversary for both the 67 days, which is the average time that a Supreme Court justice should be confirmed and the anniversary of our proposal to fund Zika.\nQ: -- for numerology. (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: It will be a busy day for journalists trying to mark where we are.\nSo the President sent that up on February 22nd. That's not a proposal that we sort of put together haphazardly. That was a proposal based on guidance from our public health officials in terms of making sure the government had the resources they need. We didn't insert a lot of wiggle room in that proposal. We actually laid out in very detailed ways what that money would be used for.\nSo I know that the Senate made a lot more progress than the House did. It's unclear how those two packages would be reconciled if even that's their plan. But I think that's why you heard the President call on Congress to work together, both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate, in order to get this done.\nI don't know why this became a partisan issue. As, again, the junior Senator from Florida has said, this is an issue of public health. And we believe Senator Rubio's House colleagues should follow suit.\nQ: And on Hiroshima, it's pretty clear there's no apology coming. But would the President express something like remorse or something similar?\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, the President is not going to revisit the decision to bomb Hiroshima. What he will do is he will lay a wreath at the Peace Memorial. He's going to briefly tour the memorial grounds and deliver brief remarks reflecting on his impressions there. He'll be joined by Prime Minister Abe. And I do expect him to recognize the human toll of war, the special responsibility that the United States carries as the only country in the world to use a nuclear weapon. And of course, he will reaffirm the United States' commitment to working towards a world with no nuclear weapons.\nGreg.\nQ: You say there's no wiggle room -- what the President sent up on February 22nd was a multi-year, no-year appropriation with broad transferability. And if you look at the history of how Congress actually approves these emergency supplementals, they almost always put a year appropriation on them. So my question to you is, what number does this administration need in fiscal year 2016 for Zika funding?\nMR. SCHULTZ: That number is $1.9 billion. And let me -- thank you for the opportunity to address this. What I meant by wiggle room is that number, the proposal that we developed wasn't done willy-nilly. It was done based on the advice and guidance of our public health professionals. And so that is the number that they have determined is what is needed to fight this possible threat.\nQ: Okay, so if you need $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2016, are you going to come back with another request for an appropriation in 2017? 2018?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think first steps first, right? Congress can't even get this done. So our belief is -- and I appreciate you going back to look at the history here because what the House of Representatives has done is tried to find offsets, which we believe is misguided, which is inconsistent with how these requests have been allocated in the past. So we do want Congress to look at history. They rose to the occasion on Ebola and they actually allocated a sufficient amount of money in order for the United States government to do its job to combat this threat. And now we're looking for the same thing on this.\nQ: So $1.9 billion or bust?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Our request has been $1.9 billion, and we hope that's fulfilled with some urgency.\nYes.\nQ: One of the criticism that Republicans have leveled against that $1.9 billion request is that there are long-term projects included in it, like new construction. How is that part of the emergency funding that the President speaks to with such urgency? I guess to follow up, the $1.1 billion is not a number that Republicans say they came up with haphazardly.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, you'll have to ask them why -- what they see is the foundation for their numbers.\nQ: Like I said, it takes out things that aren't emergency, like new construction.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I urge you to take a look at our proposal because what we do is we detail exactly what these funds would be used. And what I can do for you is lay out exactly what's not happening because Congress hasn't done its job. And let me just walk you through a few examples.\nBy Congress stymying this request, they have delayed the development of vaccines. We're asked frequently in this room what the status of that development is. Unfortunately, we are unable to accelerate that because of Congress not doing its job. Diagnostics tests to make sure that manufacturers can develop faster and more accurate tests are needed to ensure sort of a frontline diagnostics and expand laboratory capacity -- that's not getting done because Congress isn't doing its job. Funding for mosquito control has slowed and even halted in some areas. We have states and partners on the ground that are starting to do mosquito surveillance control activities, but they need funding. That stuff doesn't pay for itself.\nAnd so, again, I cannot for the life of me figure out why Congress wants to pass the buck on this instead of rolling up their sleeves and doing their job.\nThanks. I will do the week ahead, and then Mark can get started on his weekend. (Laughter.) New spokesman, same joke.\nI know we've already laid out the schedule so I might have to hunt -- oh, I think I have it.\nGreat. Go as you know, the President will depart Sunday afternoon -- I'm sorry, Saturday afternoon, and Monday morning arrive in Hanoi, Vietnam. While in Hanoi, the President will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Quang. Following this meeting, the President will meet with the Chairwoman of the National Assembly. And afterwards, the President will participate in a press conference with the President, and attend the state luncheon.\nLater in the afternoon, the President will participate in a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Vietnam. In the evening, the President will participate in a bilateral meeting with General Secretary of the Community Party of Vietnam.\nOn Tuesday, the President will meet with embassy personnel and families. Later in the morning, the President will meet with members of civil society -- that's something that the President likes to do in these countries. In the afternoon, the President will deliver remarks on U.S.-Vietnam relations, where I think he'll reflect on a lot of the themes we spoke of here today.\nThe President will then travel to Ho Chi Minh City. He will tour the Jade Pagoda, and following his visit, he'll make remarks.\nOn Wednesday, the President will meet with U.S. consulate staff and family members, and then the President will participate in a town hall with young people in Ho Chi Minh City. In the afternoon, the President will depart Vietnam en route to Japan.\nOn Thursday, he'll make a cultural stop, and then in the afternoon, he'll attend meetings at the G7 Summit.\nOn Friday, the President will attend G7 meetings on energy, climate -- in particular the implementation of the Paris agreement -- and the prosperity of Asia and the United States.\nIn the afternoon, the President will depart en route to Hiroshima. While in Hiroshima, the President, as we discussed, will deliver remarks, and participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. The President will also meet with servicemembers. And in the evening, the President will depart for Washington, D.C.\nWith that, have a great weekend.\nThank you.\nEND 2:25 P.M.

Bernie Sanders on Friday told a community college rally that he is much more likely than Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump.\n\"Hillary Clinton is not the Democratic candidate most likely to defeat Donald Trump. Our campaign is the campaign ...,\" Sanders said as cheers drowned him out.\nClinton has slipped behind Trump in two recent national polls and her edge over Trump narrowed significantly in a New York Times/CBS News survey published Sunday. Sanders 13-point advantage over Trump was more than twice as great as Clinton's shrinking six-point edge. Sanders also cited a recent Fox News poll in which he said Trump \"rather frighteningly\" is ahead of Clinton by three points. In that same poll, Sanders held a 46-42 percent advantage over Trump.\n\"The reason we are the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump has everything to do with you. We have seen from coast to coast a level of excitement and energy in a campaign that we have not seen in a very long time,\" Sanders told more than 2,400 supporters jammed into a gymnasium at Santa Fe Community College and 600 more who listened on loudspeakers in an overflow area outside.\n\"I have been moved and inspired by turnouts like this all across this country. The energy, the excitement is in our campaign, not Secretary Clinton's campaign,\" he added.\nSanders has notched wins in 20 states including three in the last three weeks in a row. With nine contests still to come, including delegate-rich California, the Vermont senator is now backed by almost 46 percent of the pledged delegates.\nClinton, by contrast, has commitments from 93 percent of the so-called superdelegates, top elected Democrats and party officials. \"These are the people who received no popular votes at all. I know many of these people. I like many of them. This is not an attack on them or their character.\" But Sanders called it \"a very bad idea\" that more than 400 superdelegates had lined up behind Clinton before any other candidate was in the race.\n\"In other words, the establishment determined who the anointed candidate would be before the voters got in the process. That is a very bad idea and an idea we intend to change at the convention,\" Sanders said.\nSanders was headed later Friday to Albuquerque for another rally in the state where 34 pledged delegates are at stake in the June 7 primary. Altogether, 694 pledged delegates are in play on that day when Democrats also vote in California, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota and South Dakota.", "timestamp": "2016-05-20", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Holds Big Lead over Trump as Clinton Slips"}

His interviews this morning were especially revealing, and even unhinged at times.\nHe once again claimed that he can't share his great foreign policy ideas because he wants unpredictability. He aggressively defended his Muslim ban. He lied about his own record, claiming he opposed the Libya intervention and Iraq War -- both of which he supported at the outset. And he demonstrated once again his dangerous penchant for going ballistic on anyone who disapproves of his proposals. Rather than taking seriously criticism from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates -- one of America's most well-respected foreign policy minds -- Trump responded with a long tirade attacking Gates. This is the same petulance that was on display when he recently cast doubt on our special relationship with the UK simply because David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticized his proposed Muslim ban, challenging the latter to an IQ test.\nThis is not how presidents behave. We can't afford to have a Commander-in-Chief who has no understanding of foreign policy, who has no coherent agenda, and who wants to go to war every time someone says a mean thing about him. As Hillary Clinton said yesterday, Donald Trump is simply not qualified for the job he seeks. This is not about ideology -- it's about responsible leadership.

Absolutely. (Applause.) You all, thank you so much! Rest yourselves, because I hear you've been working all year. (Laughter.)\nTo say it is a pleasure and an honor to be here with you today is an understatement. I am so thrilled and so proud. And I want to start by thanking Jim, not just for that generous introduction but for his tremendous leadership. He has been amazing. I just got through talking to the board just telling them that I couldn't be more proud of the folks who helped to start this thing.\nAnd I would have to thank Larry Soler as well for his longstanding service and dedication to the PHA, and all the original board members and the folks who came on board. I just want to take a moment to give them all a round of applause, and to congratulate them on their phenomenal accomplishments. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, to the growing staff, one -- there are more than one. Thank you all for doing such great work. Absolutely. (Applause.) And I want to acknowledge our FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf. And we're pleased that he was able to join us today, so let's give him a round of applause. (Applause.)\nAnd I want to recognize all the folks who have made such outstanding commitments this year to raising a healthier generation, including Westin, and Trinity Health, and Dick's Sporting Goods, and so many others. I got to meet many of them backstage. Thank you. Thank you all for becoming a part of this team. Congratulations on your commitments. (Applause.)\nFinally, most of all, I want to thank all of you here. For years, even decades -– long before childhood obesity was ever in the headlines –- so many of you were leading the charge. I spoke to a woman who said she's been working on this issue for 16 years -- leading that charge, creating programs, lobbying for policies, reformulating products, and doing everything you could to raise awareness about this issue.\nAnd since we first launched Let's Move!, PHA has brought together partners like you in more than 50,000 locations across all 50 states. And what you all have achieved in just six years, man, it truly takes my breath away. Let's just look at the stats. I know you all have been talking about it, but I want to go over it again. (Laughter.)\nBecause of you, 1.6 million kids are now in healthy daycares, eating more than 225 million healthy snacks and meals a year. Those are our babies. We're doing it there. (Applause.) Thirty million kids are eating healthier school breakfasts and lunches. Ten million kids are getting 60 minutes of physical activity at a Let's Move! Active School. They're getting that every day. Eighty million Americans are living in a Let's Move! City, Town or County with summer meal programs, and athletic leagues, and new parks and playgrounds. Eight point one million people in underserved areas finally have somewhere to buy groceries, including 1,000 convenience stores that are now selling fresh food. I love that. (Applause.)\nAnd PHA's FNV campaign to market fruits and vegetables has gotten 1 billion media impressions in just one year. Yes, that's billion. My husband would die for those numbers. (Laughter.) And they say that 70 percent of folks who saw the campaign said they ate more produce as a result. So it's not just idle hits and views; people are actually being impacted.\nAnd today, I am thrilled to announce another new achievement to add to that list -– and it's a big one, as far as I'm concerned. For the first time in 20 years, the FDA has finalized a new and improved nutrition facts label that will be on nearly 800,000 food products nationwide. The calorie count is bigger, bigger font, so you can actually see it. (Laughter.) The serving sizes are more realistic. And, most important of all, this label will tell you how much sugar in your snack was added during processing, and how much of it comes from ingredients like fruit. (Applause.) So very soon -- very soon -- you will no longer need a microscope, a calculator, or a degree in nutrition to figure out whether the food you're buying is actually good for our kids. So that's a phenomenal achievement. (Applause.) And I want to thank everyone at the FDA who worked to get this over the finish line. I hope you all are proud, because this was not easy to do.\nThese are extraordinary accomplishments. And as I said at the outset, you all should be proud. Because together, you all are truly transforming the way our kids live and eat. And even more importantly, as many of you know from your work on the ground, and contrary to what the naysayers predicted, millions of kids are truly embracing this change.\nAfter all that hand-wringing when we first launched Let's Move! about how kids are picky eaters, and schools wouldn't be able to prepare more nutritious meals that students would actually enjoy, and food manufacturers wouldn't make healthy versions of their products that young consumers would prefer -– remember all that? I do. (Laughter.) Well, after all that, it turns out that kids are even more excited about this stuff than we are. And after six years, it's becoming their new normal. Many of them don't know anything else.\nAnd let me tell you, I see this everywhere I go. I saw it at the Burke County Middle School in rural Georgia. Now, Burke County Schools have a Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Grant Program where they expose their elementary school kids to over 65 fruits and vegetables. And last year, when some of those same students reached middle school, they decided that they wanted to plant their own garden. And now, they're learning math and science lessons from that garden. They're even writing a cookbook for the food they've grown.\nAnd the day I visited, their lunch menu –- which, by the way, like 98 percent of schools nationwide, now meets our healthier meal standards -– (applause) -- yes, indeed. But they were having for lunch local cabbage that was delicious, collard greens, and sweet potatoes. And let me tell you, those kids devoured that food. They were practically licking their plates.\nBecause, look, their school nutrition team has developed creative recipes for vegetables that kids love. They've done the work. They've also created healthier versions of kids' favorite foods, like everything from barbeque chicken sandwiches with fresh sauce on homemade wheat buns -- homemade buns, all of their buns are homemade -- (laughter) -- baked southern chicken with a garden fresh vegetable cheese casserole that was really good -- they do that instead of mac and cheese. So obviously I tried some of the dishes, and I have to tell you, the food was really good. And you could tell that it was prepared by loving hands, because talking to the men and women who worked in those kitchens, it was important for them to do right by the kids and make that food taste good. That's the kind of healthy food these kids are now used to eating every day.\nKids in urban settings are also embracing this change. I saw it just last month at the Phillip's Academy Charter School in Newark, New Jersey. Now, this is an inner-city school where the kids were bursting with excitement as they showed me the garden they had planted on the rooftop of the school, right in a very urban setting. That garden was their pride and joy. They were showing off their little composting thing. They had their nice little dresses on and they were rolling that pen. (Laughter.) Oh, they were so cute. The eighth graders there had been harvesting and eating those vegetables since first grade. So you see, we're starting to see the growth of these kids who started there.\nBut after spending time with the kids, pulling worms out of their compost heap -- that was a great shot for the cameras -- (laughter) -- we shared a snack -- and this was their regular snack -- of quinoa protein bars -- handmade, homemade -- with beet smoothies, which, by the way, all those kids gulped down. I wasn't even that keen on the beet smoothie, but they were like, just try it, you'll like it, you'll get used to it. (Laughter.) But this is the kind of food they were eating every day for most of their elementary school years. So they were used to it. This was their normal.\nThat's the kind of transformation we're seeing in kids all across this country. They're learning through first-hand experience that healthy food can be fun and delicious. And they're making the connection between what they eat and how they feel. In fact, just last week, I'm sure many of you saw the New York Times article about how when schools start teaching students –- particularly their athletes –- about nutrition, kids actually start changing their behavior. And in this article, one young man said he went from eating ice cream and soda every day to having grilled chicken salads and fish because he now understands that his nutrition affects his performance on the playing field.\nSo when we talk about raising a healthier generation, this is what we mean. And it's happening before our very eyes. Because today, from the time our kids are barely old enough to talk, so many of them are hearing a new set of messages and being exposed to a new set of options around healthy eating. And they are internalizing those messages. They are owning and loving those choices. And as a result, they're developing a set of habits and preferences that will set them on a healthy path for the rest of their lives.\nAnd while it's incredibly exciting that we've had this kind of impact, it's also not all that surprising. Because here's the thing -- ultimately, our children are a reflection of our investment in them, plain and simple. So if we refuse to put in the effort to provide nutritious food for our kids, they will reflect that back in poor health and life outcomes. But if we stand up for what's best for them, if we demand better choices for them and get then excited about those choices, then they will absolutely follow our lead. And then our culture will shift in response to those choices.\nAnd I really want to emphasize that last point about culture change. See, it's no accident that fast-food places are now serving apples and skim milk in their kids' meals, or that food and beverage companies -- including many in the room here today -- have cut 6.4 trillion calories from their products and are racing to stock grocery shelves with healthier options. These companies are simply responding to rapidly changing consumer demands. And that change is happening more quickly than we could have ever imagined.\nI mean, just think about it. If six years ago, someone had told you that Fenway Park would have a 5,000 square foot farm on their rooftop to provide fresh produce for their fans -- (applause) -- or that 50 million Americans would visit a government website called MyPlate to learn about healthy eating, or that sales of kale would jump 50 percent in just four years -- (laughter and applause) -- or that the first unanimously chosen NBA MVP, Steph Curry, would choose fruits, vegetables, and water as his primary product endorsements –- (applause) -- if someone had told you all that six years ago, you would have thought they had were out of their minds. But that's the kind of meaningful, tangible change that we're seeing throughout the country.\nAnd I want to be very clear: You all did this, not me. I might have added a little sparkle or publicity -- (laughter) -- but you all did the work. You did the work. You made the commitments. You stepped up.\nSo the truth is, is that it actually doesn't matter where I'm sitting eight months from now. What matters is that we all keep standing together on behalf of our kids. That's what matters. (Applause.) Because while you all might have felt more empowered these last six years because someone in the White House was excited about this issue, the real power lies with all of the parents and consumers, all the partners –- and, most importantly, all these kids that you all have helped to inspire.\nAnd while next year I will no longer be First Lady, I just want you to know that I will always be here as a partner in this effort -- always. (Applause.)\nSo I'm not here today to give a victory speech, and these certainly aren't my closing remarks on this issue -- just the opposite. I was passionate about this issue long before I became First Lady, and I plan to work on it long after I leave the White House. Because as far as I'm concerned, everything we've done before today was simply phase one of our work together. That was phase one. (Applause.) And while we have accomplished a lot, we are just getting started.\nYes, it's true that childhood obesity rates have stopped rising for the first time in decades. Yes, it's true that rates are dropping for our youngest kids. But during this first phase, we haven't yet achieved the ultimate change we seek, which is to end our epidemic of childhood obesity once and for all. Instead, what we've done is been laying the groundwork for that change.\nWe've been finding innovative and inspirational new ways to raise awareness and create new products and build new programs and policies. And if we truly want to achieve our goal, we're going to need to continue and scale up these efforts, and we need to give them time to actually have their intended impact.\nWe also need to be thinking about the new voices, the champions, the new ideas we can bring to this work. Who's our next Steph Curry? What's the next FNV or Drink Up campaign? We got to keep it moving. (Laughter.) In this next phase, we're going to need to get even more creative, even more innovative. We've got to find new ways to reach these kids in ways they will hear it.\nAnd we're also going to need some patience, real patience, and a whole lot of perseverance. Because as you all know, this is not a trendy issue of the month or even an issue of the year. This is a generational problem. It took us decades to get here, and it's going to take us years to climb our way back. And the only way we can do that is by continuing to focus on one thing and one thing only, and that is doing what's best for our kids.\nSee, if that is our North Star that guides everything we do, if we focus not just on our profit margins but on how our products affect our kids' health, if we realize that investments in P.E. and recess and nutritious school food are absolutely essential to ensure the success of all of our kids, if we keep pushing our kids at home just to eat their veggies every night, then we can absolutely reach our goal of raising a healthier generation.\nSo when we encounter folks with an agenda that doesn't include our kids' health, we can't get tired. We can't get frustrated. We can't give up. Because we know that those folks aren't our biggest obstacle. Our biggest obstacle is our own complacency.\nAnd when one in three kids in this country is still overweight or obese; when we're spending billions of dollars treating obesity-related conditions; when four-star generals are sounding the alarm on this issue because they are struggling to recruit young people who can meet the fitness standards of our military -- then the stakes are far too high to back down even for a single second.\nSo let me end with a quote from Donna Martin. Donna is the Director of the School Nutrition Program for the Burke County Public School System that I talked about earlier. In a blog post that she wrote after my visit, she says: \"This is our chance to help mold the future that our children will endure for the rest of their lives. It goes without saying that regardless of political stance, personal or religious beliefs, that is a statement that we can all believe in.\"\nAnd I couldn't agree more. And that's why I'm in this, and I'm in this for life. I'm in this until we fix this.\nSo today, I want to ask all of you: Are you in this with me? (Applause.) What's that? Are you all in this? (Applause.) Wait, wait, come on, PHA Summit, are you guys in? Are you ready for this fight? Are you ready to keep adding commitments and building on this success? (Applause.) Because I'm in. I am so far in. We have gotten so much done. (Applause.)\nI am so glad to hear that, because we have a lot of work ahead of us, but if we keep coming together and digging deep, and making real investments in our kids' health, then I know we can solve this problem. We're on our way. I know we can give every child in this country the bright future that we know they deserve. I am so grateful to you all. Congratulations for everything you have done and what you will continue to do. Let's roll up our sleeves and keep it going.\nThank you all so much. God bless.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 12:04 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Anthony S. Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Also participating in the meeting were Vice President Joe Biden; Shaun L.S. Donovan, Director, Office of Management and Budget; and Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Amy Pope.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117458", "text": "Well, I just had an opportunity to get a full briefing from Secretary Burwell, CDC Director Frieden, as well as Tony Fauci from NIH about the Zika situation, and I wanted to give the American people a quick update on where we are.\nAs has been explained repeatedly, but I want to reemphasize, Zika is not like Ebola. This is not a human-to-human transmission, with the one exception that we'll talk about. It's primarily transmitted through mosquitoes, a very particular type of mosquito. But what we do know is that if you contract Zika, even if you don't appear to have significant symptoms, it is possible for Zika to cause significant birth defects, including microcephaly, where the skull casing is—the head of the infant, is significantly smaller. We think that there may be other neurological disorders that are caused as a consequence of Zika, and we don't know all of the potential effects. We do know that they are serious.\nRight now what we've seen is a little over 500 cases of Zika in the continental United States, and they all appear to be travel related, not mosquito transmitted, meaning somebody from the U.S. went down to an area that has Zika, got a bite, came back. We have seen at least 10 cases in which a individual went to one of these areas, got infected, and then sexually transmitted Zika to their partner.\nA more significant, immediate concern is Puerto Rico, where we know that there are over 800 cases that have been diagnosed. However, we suspect that it could be significantly higher. The reason is, is that for most people, you may not have a lot of symptoms when you get Zika. If you are not pregnant or the partner of somebody who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant, then you may not even know that you end up having Zika. And that means that people oftentimes are not affirmatively going to the doctor and getting tested on these issues.\nNow, here's the good news, is that because of the good work that's been done by the Department of Health and Human Services, by the CDC, as well as NIH, we have put forward a plan; we've got a plan over the next several months to begin developing a vaccine and to continually improve our diagnostic tests. We're also working with all the States so that they're properly prepared if we start seeing an outbreak here in the continental United States during the summer when obviously mosquitoes are more active.\nAnd what we're also trying to do is to develop new tools for vector control, meaning how do we kill mosquitoes and reduce their populations, particularly this kind of mosquito. That's a tricky piece of business because we've been using a lot of insecticides for a long time that have become less and less effective. New strains of mosquitoes become resistant to the insecticides that we have. The methods we use aren't as effective as they used to be. And so we're also investing a lot of time, research, logistical support to States and local communities to start improving our ability to control mosquitoes.\nPuerto Rico is most urgent and some of the Territories, but we're also spending time working with the States so that they can be better prepared.\nAll of this work costs money. And we have put forward a package that costs $1.9 billion in emergency funding in order for us to make sure that we are doing effective mosquito control, to make sure that we are developing effective diagnostic tools and distributing them, to make sure that we are developing the vaccines that ultimately will prevent some of the tragedies that we've seen for those who have contracted Zika and then end up having children with significant birth defects.\nAnd we didn't just choose the $1.9 billion from the top of our heads. This was based on public health assessments of all the work that needs to be done. And to the extent that we want to be able to feel safe and secure and families who are of childbearing years want to feel as if they can have confidence that when they travel, when they want to start a family, that this is not an issue—to the extent that that's something that we think is important—then this is a pretty modest investment for us to get those assurances.\nUnfortunately, what we have right now is the Senate approving a package that would fund a little over half of what's been requested. The House so far has approved about a third of the money that's been requested, except that money is taken from the fund that we're currently using to continue to monitor and fight against Ebola. So, effectively, there's no new money there; all that the House has done is said, you can rob Peter to pay Paul. And given that I have, at least, pretty vivid memories of how concerned people were about Ebola, the notion that we would stop monitoring as effectively and dealing with Ebola in order to deal with Zika doesn't make a lot of sense. And I don't think it will make a lot of sense to the American people.\nSo here's the upshot. This is something that is solvable. It is not something that we have to panic about, but it is something we have to take seriously. And if we make a modest investment on the front end, then this is going to be a problem that we don't have to deal with on the back end.\nEvery child that has something like microcephaly, that may end up costing up to $10 million over the lifetime of that child in terms of that family providing that child the support that they need. That sets aside the pain and the sorrow and the challenges that they're going to go through. Add that up. It doesn't take a lot of cases for you to get to $1.9 billion. Why wouldn't we want to make that investment now?\nSo my hope was that we would have had a bill that I could sign now, because part of what we're trying to do is to accelerate, get the process going for vaccines. You don't get a vaccine overnight. Initially, you have to test it to make sure that any potential vaccine is safe. Then, you have to test to make sure that it's effective. You have to try—conduct trials where you're testing it on a large-enough bunch of people that you can make scientific determinations that it's effective.\nSo we've got to get moving. And what essentially NIH and CDC have been doing is taking pots of money from other things—universal flu funds or Ebola funds or other funds—just to get the thing rolling. But we have to reimburse those pots of money that have already been depleted, and we have to be able to sustain the work that's going to need to be done to finish the job.\nSo bottom line is, Congress needs to get me a bill. It needs to get me a bill that has sufficient funds to do the job. They should not be going off on recess before this is done. And certainly, this has to get done over the course of the next several weeks in order for us to be able to provide confidence to the American people that we're handling this piece of business.\nIf I'm a young family right now or somebody who's thinking about starting a family, this is just a piece of insurance that I want to purchase. And I think that's true for most Americans. So —and understand that this is not something where we can build a wall to prevent. Mosquitoes don't go through Customs. To the extent that we're not handling this thing on the front end, we're going to have bigger problems on the back end.\nSo for those of you who are listening, tell your Members of Congress, get on the job on this. This is something we can handle. We should have confidence in our ability to take care of it. We've got outstanding scientists and researchers who are in the process of getting this done, but they've got to have the support from the public in order for us to accomplish our goal.\nOkay.

Throughout National Safe Boating Week, we recognize the risks associated with one of our country's favorite pastimes and encourage everyone to apply safe boating practices.\nSafe boating practices should be observed prior to leaving land—no matter the length of the trip, the type of boat, or the size of the body of water. Boaters can reduce risks and enhance their safety by enrolling in a boating safety course. Vessels should be thoroughly examined, float plans should be prepared, and current laws and regulations should be known prior to embarking on a journey on the water. I encourage everyone to visit www.USCGBoating.org to find resources, learn more about responsible boating, or apply for a free vessel safety check. When boat operators and their passengers exercise caution when boating—including by wearing life jackets at all times and avoiding consumption of drugs and alcohol—accidents can be avoided, lives can be saved, and everyone can have a safe and enjoyable experience.\nThis week, we also recognize the men and women of the United States Coast Guard who dedicate themselves to protecting our Nation's waterways and assisting those at sea. As we continue to take advantage of our country's beautiful bodies of water, let us recommit to ensuring water safety and exercising appropriate boating procedures.\nIn recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as \"National Safe Boating Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2016, as National Safe Boating Week.

On Armed Forces Day, we offer our most profound gratitude to the patriots—at home and abroad—who have risked their lives so our people can live knowing the fullest measure of freedom and security.\nWith courage and honor, our men and women in uniform embody the everlasting responsibility we have to each other and to future generations by giving of themselves to ensure the preservation of our Republic and secure peace throughout the world. It is because of them and the values they represent that people across the globe look to the United States of America in moments of desperation and despair. For the relief they offer, the stability they provide, and the hope they inspire, we owe our service members an extraordinary debt—one we will never stop working to repay.\nOur country's strength is measured by how we support and take care of our troops.

The patriots of the United States Merchant Marine have long served as our Nation's \"fourth arm of defense,\" safeguarding the ideals that have guided our country for more than two centuries. They facilitate the transport and trade of American goods, and they put their lives on the line in times of war. On National Maritime Day, we honor our Merchant Mariners and celebrate their irreplaceable role in shaping our Nation's narrative.\nWhether in still or raging waters, Merchant Mariners are fundamental to guaranteeing the delivery of essential goods to far-reaching corners of our globe. These seafarers have bravely faced threats at home and abroad—including combatants and pirates, disease outbreaks and natural disasters—and they consistently heed the call to serve their fellow Americans. In World War II, their ships carried troops and much-needed support to the battlefield, thousands making the ultimate sacrifice. They were among the first to see battle, and many were among the last to return home to our shores.\nCarrying forward a legacy that spans generations, the United States Merchant Marine is vital to our Nation's economic security as well. Their transportation of vital cargo has impacts far beyond America's borders, generating trillions of dollars of economic activity each year. And when our entrepreneurs decide to embark on new ventures across oceans, mariners stand by and protect their pursuit of the American dream through tireless work to cultivate safe and open waterways. On this day, and every day, let us express our sincere gratitude to these courageous men and women for all they do for our Nation, and let us reaffirm our commitment to support them as they continue to uphold their proud tradition of service.\nThe Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as \"National Maritime Day,\" and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2016, as National Maritime Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and to display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on this day.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-20", "title": "Proclamation 9453—National Maritime Day, 2016"}

Last summer, I got a letter from a woman named Elizabeth Paredes from Tucson, Arizona. Elizabeth is the mom of a 3-year-old boy and an assistant manager at a sandwich shop. She earns about $2,000 a month, and she routinely works some 50 hours a week, sometimes even more. But because of outdated overtime regulations, she doesn't have to be paid a dime of overtime. She wrote: \"It's not easy work and requires a lot of time away from my son… at times, I find [it's] not worth it.\"\nThings like the 40-hour workweek and overtime are two of the most basic pillars of a middle class life. But for all the changes we've seen in our economy, our overtime rules have only been updated once since the 1970s—just once. In fact, 40 years ago, more than 60 percent of workers were eligible for overtime based on their salaries. But today, that number is down to 7 percent. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried workers are eligible for overtime based on their income.\nThat's why this week, my administration took a step to help more workers get the overtime pay they've earned. The Department of Labor finalized a rule to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans. It's a move that will boost wages for working Americans by $12 billion over the next 10 years. We're more than doubling the overtime salary threshold. And what that means is, most salaried workers who earn less than about $47,500 a year will qualify for overtime. Or their employers can choose to give them a raise so that they earn more than $47,500. Or if employers don't want to raise wages, they can let them go home after 40 hours and see their families or train for new jobs. Any way you slice it, it's a win for working families. And we're making sure that every 3 years, there will be an automatic update to this threshold so that working families won't fall through the cracks for decades at a time ever again.\nThis is the single biggest step I can take through executive action to raise wages for the American people. It means that millions of hard-working Americans like Elizabeth will either get paid for working more than 40 hours, or they'll get more time with their families. Either way, they win, the middle class wins, and America wins.\nWe still have more work to do to make sure this economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. That's why I'll never stop fighting for as long as I hold this office to restore the sense that in America, hard work should be rewarded with the chance to get ahead.\nThanks, everybody.

H.R. 897 would weaken environmental protections under the Clean Water Act by exempting pesticide spraying from the currently required Pesticide General Permit. Creating a new statutory exemption to the Permit is unnecessary, as it was explicitly crafted to allow immediate responses to declared pest emergencies, thereby allowing vector control methods to be applied to the possible influx of disease-carrying mosquitos.\nIn fact, most mosquito control districts and Federal and State agencies already have authority under the Pesticide General Permit to apply mosquitocides as needed to respond to Zika virus concerns and do not require any additional authorization under the Permit. In rare circumstances where a mosquito control district did not seek prior coverage under the Permit, emergency provisions of the Permit are available that allow instant authorization to spray without the need for prior notification.\nThe Administration is committed to taking necessary steps, as quickly as possible, to protect the American people from the Zika virus.

Shimkus, R-IL, and 16 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports the bipartisan, bicameral efforts to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) embodied in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2576. The bill is a clear improvement over the current TSCA and represents a historic advancement for both chemical safety and environmental law.\nConsistent with the Administration's 2009 Principles for TSCA Reform, the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2576 would address flaws in current law that have limited the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to protect public health and the environment from chemical risks. These important changes include: (1) requiring EPA to evaluate new and existing chemicals against a new risk-based safety standard that includes explicit considerations for vulnerable populations; (2) empowering EPA to require the development of chemical information necessary to support these evaluations; (3) establishing clear and enforceable deadlines that ensure both timely review of prioritized chemicals and timely action on identified risks; (4) increasing the public transparency of chemical information by limiting unwarranted claims of confidentiality and allowing for the appropriate sharing of confidential information with States and health and environmental professionals; and (5) providing a source of funding for EPA to carry out these significant new responsibilities. While not perfect, the bill meets the high goals set by the Administration for meaningful reform and we commend the House and Senate for taking this historic step.\nIf the Federal government is to restore public confidence in the safety of chemicals, which are used in commerce and are an integral part of the Nation's economy, it is essential that the Congress provide EPA with the necessary tools and authorities to effectively assess chemicals and regulate risks. This legislation provides a solid foundation for advancing these goals and improving public health and environmental protection.

Rogers, R-KY)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5055, making appropriations for energy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nWhile the bill increases certain energy research and development activities, it underfunds critical energy research and development activities overall. The bill does not put the Nation on a sufficiently ambitious path toward doubling clean energy research and development by? FY 2021. Specifically, H.R. 5055 underfunds the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs, with levels significantly below the FY 2017 Budget request, which would undermine critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies. At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement. The bill also eliminates funding for important restoration efforts by the Bureau of Reclamation on the San Joaquin River, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts as well as efforts to help address long-term water challenges in the drought-sensitive San Joaquin region. Furthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological provisions, including provisions that threaten to undermine our ability to protect a resource that is essential to America's health: clean water.\nDespite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in improving resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten the economy, public health, and natural resources. The Administration also appreciates the Committee's strong support for the National Nuclear Security Administration's Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors programs.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. If the President were presented with H.R. 5055, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDepartment of Energy (DOE)\nMission Innovation. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain increases in clean energy RD&D investment, including for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). These increases are directionally consistent with Mission Innovation, helping move clean energy RD&D forward. Despite these gains however, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities overall, and does not put us on a sufficiently ambitious path toward doubling clean energy research and development by? FY 2021. The bill underfunds investment in our students, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs; our businesses and universities; and our future economy. This would slow the pace of progress on breakthroughs in energy efficiency and clean energy; undermine America's long-standing nonpartisan support for pioneering research that seeks solutions to pressing problems; and hinder our ability to harness the power of new ideas and innovation to drive sustained economic growth in the clean energy economy of the future.\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). The Administration objects to the $306 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which, while an increase relative to enacted levels, is a reduction of $44 million or 14 percent from the discretionary request for ARPA-E in the FY 2017 Budget request. This reduction would hinder the ability to invest in transformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.\nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). The Administration strongly objects to the $1.8 billion provided in the bill for EERE. Overall, this level is $1.1 billion below the FY 2017 Budget request. Relative to the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 36 percent, sustainable transportation by 37 percent, and energy efficiency by 30 percent. These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy, electric and other advanced vehicles, and building technologies. At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced or cancelled, limiting innovation and technological advancement. Funding at this level also would impede the development of solutions to reduce U.S. dependency on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermines the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $2.9 billion.\nOffice of Science. While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of Science and the funding level of $5.4 billion provided in the bill, this is $172 million below the FY 2017 Budget request and would significantly impact basic research and development (R&D) programs, most critically in Foundational Genomics Research and Bioenergy Research Centers within Biological and Environmental Research.\nElectricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The Administration urges the Congress to fund important grid modernization activities at the FY 2017 Budget request level of $262 million instead of the $225 million provided in the bill. This funding supports important grid modernization activities including State Distribution Level Reform and State Energy Assurance which respond to Quadrennial Energy Review recommendations.\nYucca Mountain. The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for Yucca Mountain and is disappointed with the rejection of the strategy proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request on nuclear waste. The strategy incorporates important and practical solutions for a successful waste program, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program funding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.\nFossil Energy Research and Development. The Administration urges the Congress to provide adequate funding for clean energy priorities by using or reallocating $240 million in balances within the Fossil Energy R&D account identified in the FY 2017 Budget request as unnecessary for Fossil Energy R&D activities.\nEnergy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund.The Administration urges the Congress to fund the Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund, as proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request. Modernization of Strategic Petroleum Reserve infrastructure is necessary to ensure the operational readiness of the Reserve.\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA). The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to completely fund investments in adding regional detail to petroleum data, enhancing commercial building energy efficiency data, and expanding international analysis.\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided full funding for DOE to implement the DATA Act within the Departmental Administration account. This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided sufficient flexibility to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOE to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nDepartmental Administration. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Office of Indian Energy as a separate budget account. The Administration appreciates the Committee's increased funding for this office, especially for important project oversight efforts. However, funding the Office of Indian Energy within the Departmental Administration account without additional resources has reduced available funding for other management and program support functions which may significantly hinder DOE's ability to effectively and efficiently implement other priority management objectives.\nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\nNonproliferation Construction. The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility. It would be irresponsible for the Congress to require continued construction of this project. The alternative disposition method is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the wasteful approach the bill would mandate. Continuing to require construction would waste limited national security funds and force more pressing nuclear security needs to go unmet. A recent independent study mandated by the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act indicates that even at a higher level of funding ($375 million annually) it would take another century (program completion date of 2115) and involve lifecycle costs of over $100 billion to complete the plutonium disposition effort using MOX. Alternative disposition would free up funds for other national security priorities, dispose of the excess plutonium safely and effectively, and meet international obligations decades sooner.\nUnrequested NNSA Rescissions. The Administration objects to section 308 of the bill which, in combination with other rescissions in the bill, would rescind more than twice the amount proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request. A rescission of this size would come at the expense of vital nuclear modernization and nonproliferation programs.\nCorps of Engineers – Civil Works (Corps)\nOverall Funding. The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of nearly $6.1 billion. The Administration appreciates the bill's investments in helping communities reduce the risk of floods, improving commercial navigation, and the Corps' efforts to restore the Nation's aquatic ecosystems requested in the FY 2017 Budget. However, the Administration believes funding included in the bill for the Corps beyond the FY 2017 Budget request would not provide a high return on investment to the American taxpayer.\nEcosystem Restoration. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ecosystem restoration activities, such as Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration, Columbia River Fish Mitigation, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery, at the levels provided in the FY 2017 Budget request.\nTechnical Assistance. The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for funding ongoing efforts that provide local communities with technical and planning assistance to enable them to reduce their flood risk, including nonstructural approaches.\nClean Water Act (CWA). The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses. The Administration strongly objects to section 110 of the bill in particular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.\nCWA Recapture. The Administration strongly opposes section 109 of the bill, aimed at preventing the Corps from using the funds provided to require a CWA permit for pollutant discharges that impair or destroy wetlands and other waters. Section 109 would overturn nearly 40 years of CWA implementation that exempts from permitting farming practices in the Nation's wetlands and eliminates regulatory burdens for farmers while protecting the Nation's water resources. Section 109 is inconsistent with administration efforts to provide farmers and ranchers with greater certainty and predictability under the CWA, reduce regulatory burdens, and protect human health and the environment. This is particularly troublesome for discharges that convert areas of navigable waters into new uses where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of those waters may be reduced.\nFirearms Policy. The Administration objects to section 111 of the bill, which prohibits the Corps from enforcing bans on firearms at water resources development projects. If enacted, this provision would prevent the Secretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided in law to enforce or revise the current Corps policy, based on considerations such as the security of critical infrastructure, public and employee safety, and the manner in which the firearm is carried (e.g., open vs. concealed). Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not have full Federal law enforcement authority.\nNational Ocean Policy. The Administration objects to section 506 of the bill, which prohibits funding provided in the bill from being used to implement the coastal and marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management components of the National Ocean Policy. This provision would prohibit DOE and the Corps from participating in marine and coastal planning efforts that would improve stewardship of the Nation's oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.\nDam Removal. The Administration objects to section 507 of the bill, which prohibits funding provided in the bill from being used for the removal of any federally owned or operated dam. While dams can provide numerous benefits to local communities, collaboratively developed strategies to remove obsolete or unnecessary dams can be important components of broader efforts to reduce public safety risks, improve the health of our rivers, and support our local economies.\nNationwide Flood Study. The Administration urges the House to restore the $1 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the ongoing Water Resources Priorities study, which has the potential to help save lives and billions of dollars. This study addresses a critical need to develop a baseline assessment of flood risks at a national and regional scale; evaluate the overall effectiveness of current approaches; and develop recommendations to reduce flood damages, loss of life, and recovery costs, in ways that would also promote the long-term resilience of communities and ecosystems.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for the Corps to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nOther Independent Agencies\nNuclear Regulatory Commission, Yucca Mountain. The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the Yucca Mountain license application.\nPOWER+ Plan. The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided $50 million to the Appalachian Regional Commission for the POWER+ Plan, fully funding the FY 2017 Budget request. The funding would help create jobs, attract capital investments, and strengthen workforce development for communities and workers that have been negatively affected by job losses in coal mining, coal power plant operations, and coal-related supply chain industries due to the changing economics of America's energy production.\nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project\nOverall Funding. The bill provides $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $11 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Act. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for priorities within the Bureau of Reclamation's program, as reflected in the FY 2017 Budget request, including Indian Water Rights settlements, and the WaterSMART program.\nSan Joaquin River Restoration. The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's elimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts. This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the implementation of Federal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation. The Congress has provided funding each year since authorizing, and the Administration urges the Congress to provide FY 2017 funding for this Administration priority at the level requested.\nCalifornia Water. The Administration strongly opposes sections 204 through 208 of the bill, which include several highly problematic provisions that undercut the Endangered Species Act and limit application of court-approved biological opinions, thereby resulting in detrimental conditions for Federal- and State-listed endangered species. Furthermore, these provisions preempt California water law, fail to address critical elements of California's complex water challenges and would, if enacted, impede an effective and timely response to the continuing drought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities. These provisions could actually slow decision-making, generate significant litigation, and limit real-time operational flexibility critical to maximizing water delivery. As the Administration has stated in the past, these provisions were developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key stakeholders affected by the drought. The urgency and seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.\nAuthorizations for Continued Operations. The Administration is disappointed that the bill did not include the language requested in the FY 2017 Budget to increase the appropriations ceiling for the Secure Water Act and to extend the California Bay-Delta Restoration authorization.\nConstitutional Concerns\nSection 201 of the bill raises separation of powers concerns.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-05-23", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5055 - Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017"}

The President's visit to Vietnam builds on this positive momentum to cement the progress of the last few years and propel our bilateral relationship to the next level.\nEngagement with Southeast Asia has been a central pillar of the U.S. Rebalance to Asia. The return on this investment is clearly evident in our relations with Vietnam, where we have significantly increased trade and investment and expanded cooperation across the board.\nOur economic ties are strong and growing quickly. Trade between our countries has nearly tripled in the last seven years, and now tops $45 billion. U.S. exports to Vietnam increased by 23 percent in 2015, the largest increase of our top 50 trade partners, and only one of two markets with double-digit growth. At the same time, the United States remained Vietnam's largest export market, growing 24 percent year-on-year.\nEconomic ties between our countries are poised to expand even further with the implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which will hold nearly 40 percent of the world's GDP accountable to the highest labor, environmental, and intellectual property rights standards of any previous trade agreement, while leveling the playing field for workers and businesses. The United States is committed to helping Vietnam continue on its path of economic reforms, including efforts required to fully implement its commitments under the TPP through technical assistance. These reforms will include work to ensure freedom of association, including independent unions, and other internationally recognized labor rights; protection and enforcement of intellectual property; and environmental protection and sustainable growth.\nU.S. investment in Vietnam has grown significantly over the past seven years to nearly $1.5 billion. Through the recently-launched U.S.-ASEAN Connect initiative we are working with all ASEAN members, including Vietnam, to foster the policy environments that promote ASEAN economic integration, increase trade and investment, assist the development of clean energy and energy connectivity, and spur sustainable, innovation-led economic growth.\nWe are working with Vietnam toward a successful 2017 APEC host year and ensuring that APEC continues to be an incubator for new ideas that spur inclusive economic growth, promote sustainable development, and advance trade liberalization.\nWe have expanded security cooperation. We have expanded cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including through the Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel engagements and joint humanitarian training exercises. The United States is strengthening security cooperation with Vietnam, including helping the government build its maritime security capabilities, by providing more than $45.7 million since FY 2014 through the State Department's Foreign Military Financing and law enforcement capacity building programs. Additional assistance is provided through the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and Maritime Security Initiative (MSI) funding, a regional initiative for which the Department of Defense has committed $425 million over five years. At Vietnam's request, we are pursuing providing 18 MetalShark 45-foot patrol boats, as well as training and maritime law enforcement equipment to the country's Coast Guard. Our Navies are working more closely together to ensure maritime security and safety.\nThe United States is supporting Vietnam's efforts to contribute to UN peacekeeping operations by assisting in the development of a peacekeeping training center near Hanoi, as well as providing medical equipment to support Vietnam's UN pledge of a deployable Level II hospital.\nWe are working together to prevent North Korea's proliferation activities and to fully implement UNSCR 2270.\nU.S.-Vietnam people-to-people ties are stronger than ever. Nearly 19,000 Vietnamese now study in the United States -- 40 percent more than in 2009. Over 80,000 Vietnamese visited the United States in 2015, and many thousands of Americans visited Vietnam. The new Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), which opens in Ho Chi Minh City later this year, will help bring world-class, independent education to Vietnam and deepen the ties between our peoples. Over 13,000 Vietnamese are members of the Young Southeast Asia Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), more than any other ASEAN country except Indonesia. We are also connecting American universities with Vietnamese higher education institutions to improve the quality of higher education in Vietnam. The United States and Vietnam signed a Peace Corps country agreement during the President's visit.\nWe have deepened cooperation on humanitarian and war legacy issues. Vietnam has provided critical assistance to our efforts to account for U.S. personnel missing in action from the war. We also continue to work with the Vietnamese government to identify the remains of Vietnamese personnel lost during that period. The United States has contributed over $92 million since 1993 to address the threats posed by unexploded ordnances (UXO). The United States has invested nearly $90 million in dioxin remediation at the Danang airport, a project that will finish next year. We have also funded an environmental assessment at Bien Hoa airbase.\nWe have expanded cooperation on regional and global challenges. Vietnam is a key partner on climate change, sustainable development, nuclear and radioactive source security, advancing the Global Health Security Agenda, and wildlife trafficking. Vietnam is taking critical steps on climate change, including committing to join the Paris Agreement this year, developing plans to implement their climate targets, and the government's call to review coal-fired power generation and move towards natural gas. The United States has invested over $40 million since 2011 to help mitigate the impacts of climate change in Vietnam, one of most vulnerable countries in the world to its effects. We are helping Vietnam reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture, forestry, and energy sectors and building resilience for communities in the Mekong River and Red River Deltas and along the coast of Vietnam. We are partnering with Vietnam to build capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats, including through Vietnam's five-year roadmap to achieve the targets of the Global Health Security Agenda and our joint effort to undertake and share external assessments of capability.\nWe also work with Vietnam as part of the Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) to develop a regional approach to sustainable environmental management and strengthen capacity to manage shared water resources. We recently responded to Vietnam's ongoing historic drought with a natural disaster declaration and $50,000 for immediate assistance to those most affected. The United States has provided $5 million to support Vietnam's efforts to counter wildlife trafficking, particularly strengthening law enforcement, and reducing demand for illegal wildlife products. The United States and Vietnam have expanded cooperation in combating transnational crime, including through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to strengthen effective border management in Vietnam through the establishment of border liaison offices.\nWe are actively promoting respect for human rights and religious freedom. The United States supports a strong, prosperous, and independent Vietnam that promotes respect for human rights, open space for civil society, and the rule of law. The Vietnamese government's commitment to protect fundamental human rights is a crucial aspect of our bilateral relationship and continued progress in that area will enable the Vietnamese people and the U.S.-Vietnam partnership to reach its fullest potential.\nDuring the April 25-26 annual U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue, the United States called on Vietnam to release all prisoners of conscience and cease harassment of individuals exercising their fundamental freedoms, including those relating to expression, assembly, and religion. Our two countries have increased cooperation on disability rights and the rights of LGBT persons in the UN Human Rights Council. We also welcome Vietnam's ratification in 2015 of the UN Convention Against Torture and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and will continue to urge their full implementation.\nThe Vietnamese government has pledged to institute legal reforms to bring Vietnam's laws into compliance with its international commitments and its 2013 constitution, which contains a new dedicated chapter on human rights. We are also supporting legal education in Vietnam by working with Vietnamese law schools through the United Nations Development Programme. We continue to explore ways that the United States can work with Vietnam to support both legal reform and the rule of law, including through a new Letter of Agreement on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Sector Assistance. U.S. and Vietnamese officials and academic experts also have increased exchanges of best practices on key laws, including the Law on Religion and Belief and the Law on Association. USAID's economic engagement with Vietnam supports strengthening the rule of law and raises standards in key areas. Working with Vietnam to ensure it meets the high standards of the TPP agreement offers an unprecedented opportunity to make progress on labor rights.\nThe U.S.-Vietnam relationship is poised for progress. In the years ahead, we look forward to working with the new Vietnamese government to strengthen our cooperation on the increasingly wide range of shared interests between our countries and deepen the bonds between our peoples.", "timestamp": "2016-05-23", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States-Vietnam Relations"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President's news conference began at 12:59 p.m. in the hotel ballroom at the International Convention Centre. President Quang, the moderator, and a reporter spoke in Vietnamese, and their remarks were translated by interpreters.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117719", "text": "President Quang. Your Excellency, President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of the leaders of the party, state, and the people of Vietnam, once again, I'd like to warmly welcome President Barack Obama and the high-level delegation of the U.S. Government on your official visit to Vietnam.\nMr. President and I had a very productive talk on bilateral relations, regional and global issues of common interest. We discussed the implementation of the joint statement on the Vietnam-U.S. comprehensive partnership signed in July 2013 and the joint vision statement between the two countries in July of 2015 concluded between the high-level leaders of the two countries. We agreed that important progresses in bilateral relations have been made in recent years. Both sides committed to implementing the principles of respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political regime.\nDuring President Obama's official visit, Vietnam and the U.S. agreed to a joint statement on strengthening the comprehensive partnership with added substance, depth, and effectiveness. Both sides agreed to place development cooperation at the center of the bilateral ties.\nOn this occasion, important deals were also reached in terms of trade, health care, humanitarian assistance, education and training, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges as well. Both sides agreed to give higher priorities to addressing war legacy issues and committed—continue to work together in this regard.\nThe U.S. will work with Vietnam on detoxing Bien Hoa Airport after both sides successfully conclude the cleanup project at Danang Airport. Vietnam very much appreciates the U.S. decision to completely lift the ban on lethal weapon sales to Vietnam, which is the clear proof that both countries have completely normalized the relations.\nPresident Obama and I also discussed the future directions of bilateral ties and measures to further deepen bilateral cooperation. We underscored the importance of confidence building and priority for development cooperation in trade and investment, science and technology, human resource development, and addressing climate change. Both sides reaffirmed the commitments to promptly ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, or TPP.\nWith respect to regional and global issues, President Obama and I agreed that we should set up collaboration at regional and international forums and that the U.S. will support Vietnam in successfully hosting the 2017 APEC summit, as well as participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations.\nWe also exchanged views on recent developments in the South China Sea. We reiterated continued cooperation on addressing climate change and sustainable use of the Mekong River water resources. We believe that promised growth in Vietnam-U.S relations not only brings about benefits for each country, but also contributes to peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the Asia-Pacific and the world and the ASEAN-U.S. relationships as well. I want to thank President Obama personally, the American leadership and people, and American friends for their good will and significant contributions to the normalization and the continued development of the Vietnam-U.S. relations. I wish President Obama and the members of your delegation a successful visit to Vietnam, with fond memories of our country, culture, and hospitality of the Vietnamese people.\nOnce again, thank you very much for the presence of American and Vietnamese press and media here today. Thank you very much.\nPresident Obama. Well, good afternoon. Xin chào. Thank you, President Quang, for your generous words. And let me thank you and the Government and the people of Vietnam for the sincere welcome and hospitality that has been extended to me and to my delegation.\nOver the past century, our two nations have known cooperation and then conflict, painful separation, and a long reconciliation. Now, more than two decades of normalized ties between our governments allows us to reach a new moment.\nIt's clear from this visit that both our peoples are eager for an even closer relationship, a deeper relationship. And I was moved to see so many people lining the streets as we were driving into town today. I bring greetings and friendship of the American people, including some outstanding Members of Congress who are joining me on this visit and so many Vietnamese Americans whose families bind us together and remind us of the values that we share.\nI've indicated before that one of my highest foreign policy priorities as President is to ensure that the United States continues to play a larger and long-term role in the Asia-Pacific, which is vital to our security and to our prosperity. We believe the people of this region should live in security, prosperity, and dignity. In pursuit of this vision, we're more deeply engaged across the Asia-Pacific than we have been in decades, and that includes our comprehensive partnership with Vietnam.\nIf you consider where we have been and where we are now, the transformation in the relations between our two countries is remarkable. Over the past two decades, our trade has surged nearly a hundredfold, supporting jobs and opportunities in both countries. Since I took office, we've boosted U.S. exports to Vietnam by more than 150 percent. We're now the single largest market for Vietnam's exports. American companies are one of the top investors here.\nWith our Fulbright programs, thousands of our students and scholars have studied together. And more than 13,000 young people across Vietnam are learning new skills as part of our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. Vietnam has become one of the top 10 countries with students in the United States. This year, we've welcomed nearly 19,000, the most ever. And last year, Vietnam welcomed nearly half a million American tourists to this country, and I will assure you that more are on the way.\nOur two governments are also cooperating more closely than ever. As part of our engagement with ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, we're working together to advance regional security and stability. Vietnam has welcomed American navy ships to your ports. Our militaries are conducting more exchanges and partnering on maritime security.\nTogether, we're pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, not only to support trade, but to draw our nations closer together and reinforce regional cooperation. We're doing more to meet global challenges, from preventing nuclear terrorism to promoting global health security so that outbreaks of disease don't become epidemics. And with this visit, the United States and Vietnam have agreed to a significant upgrade in our cooperation across the board.\nWe're taking new steps to give our young people the education and skills that they need to succeed. And I'm very pleased that, for the first time, the Peace Corps will come to Vietnam. Our Peace Corps volunteers will focus on teaching English, and the friendship that our people forge will bring us closer together for decades to come.\nAmerican academic and technological leaders—including Intel, Oracle, Arizona State University, and others—will help Vietnamese universities boost training in science, technology, engineering, and math. Harvard Medical School, Johnson & Johnson, GE, and others will join with Vietnam universities to improve medical education. And now that the Government of Vietnam has granted the necessary license, we can say that Fulbright University Vietnam—this country's first nonprofit, independent university—can move forward and open its doors and welcome its first class this fall.\nWe're increasing trade. With Vietnam's announcement on multiple-entry visas, it will be easier for Americans to come here and do business and travel. President Quang and I just attended a signing ceremony that many of you saw, where American and Vietnamese companies are moving ahead with the new commercial deals worth more than $16 billion. Boeing will sell a hundred aircraft to VietJet. Pratt & Whitney will sell advanced engines. GE Wind will partner with the Vietnamese Government to develop more wind power. Deals like these are a win for both of our countries, helping to fuel Vietnam's economic growth and supporting tens of thousands of American jobs.\nWe agreed to work to ratify and implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership as soon as possible, because it will support vital economic reforms here, further integrate Vietnam into the global economy, and reduce tariffs on American exports to Vietnam. And we discussed the high standards that Vietnam has committed to meet under TPP on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. And I conveyed that the United States is prepared to offer technical assistance to Vietnam as it works to fully implement these standards so that TPP delivers the benefits that our peoples expect.\nWith regard to security, the United States will continue to do our part to address the painful legacy of war. On behalf of the American people, including our veterans, I want to thank the Government and the people of Vietnam for the many years of cooperation to account for Americans missing in action, solemn efforts that we'll continue together. We'll continue to help remove unexploded landmines and bombs. And now that our joint effort to remove dioxin—agent orange—from Danang Airport is nearly complete, the United States will help in the cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nWe've agreed to continue deepening our defense cooperation, including patrol boats and training for Vietnam's Coast Guard and to work more closely together in responding to humanitarian disasters. And I can also announce that the United States is fully lifting the ban on the sale of military equipment to Vietnam that has been in place for some 50 years. As with all our defense partners, sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights. But this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself, and it removes a lingering vestige of the cold war. It also underscores the commitment of the United States to a fully normalized relationship with Vietnam, including strong defense ties with Vietnam and this region for the long term. More broadly, the United States and Vietnam are united in our support for a regional order—including in the South China Sea—where international norms and rules are upheld, where there is freedom of navigation and overflight, where lawful commerce is not impeded, and where disputes are resolved peacefully, through legal means, in accordance with international law. I want to repeat that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, and we will support the right of all countries to do the same.\nNow, even as we make important progress in the ways that I've just described, there continue to be areas where our two governments disagree, including on democracy and human rights. And I made it clear that the United States does not seek to impose our form of government on Vietnam or any nation. We respect Vietnam's sovereignty and independence. At the same time, we will continue to speak out on behalf of human rights that we believe are universal, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. And that includes the right of citizens, through civil society, to organize and help improve their communities and their country.\nWe believe, and I believe, that nations are stronger and more prosperous when these universal rights are upheld and when our two countries continue to discuss these issues as part of our human rights dialogue in a spirit of construction—constructive and cooperative effort.\nAnd finally, the United States and Vietnam are expanding our cooperation in ways that benefit the world. Under our growing climate change partnership, we'll support Vietnam as it works to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Because our two countries and others have committed to joining the agreement this year, we're within striking distance of it entering into force before anybody expected.\nIn the meantime, we'll help communities in vulnerable regions, like the Mekong Delta adapt to a changing climate and assist Vietnam's transition to a low-carbon economy. And that includes the low-carbon energy that will come from our cooperation on civil nuclear power. And as Vietnam prepares to deepen its commitment to U.N. peacekeeping, the United States is proud to support Vietnam's new peacekeeping training center.\nSo, again, President Quang, thank you for your hospitality. Thank you for our work together. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to visit with the Vietnamese people. Maybe I will enjoy some cà phê sữa đá. [Laughter] I believe that the relationship between the Vietnamese people and the United States can be one of the most important in this critical part of the world. And I believe that the upgrade in our ties that we've achieved today will deliver greater security, prosperity, and dignity for both of our peoples for many decades to come.\nXin cảm ơn.\nModerator. Thank you, President Obama and President Quang. And now it's time for questions. The floor is open. I invite Mr.—[inaudible]—from Vietnam News Agency.\nQ. I'm from the Vietnam News Agency. I have a question for President Quang. Your Excellency, could you advise us and make some comments on the notable advances in Vietnam-U.S. relations over the past two decades? Thank you.\nPresident Quang. Thank you for your question. I want to affirm that over the past two decades, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in July 1995, Vietnam-U.S. relations have made great strides in many fields. In terms of politics and diplomacy, Vietnam and the U.S. are former enemies turned friends. And now we are comprehensive partners. The high-level leaders of the two countries often pay a visit to each other, and the relations have grown very well bilaterally and multilaterally. We share the common interests regarding the regional and international issues. And our common interests grow day by day, particularly in relations to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region.\nWith respect to economic cooperation, I'm very pleased to inform you that the two-way trade has grown 130-fold to 44.5 billion U.S. dollars last year. The U.S. is currently the seventh largest investor in Vietnam, and I hope that the U.S. will soon become the biggest investor in Vietnam, as Ambassador Ted Osius once mentioned. The bilateral trade between the two countries has enormous potentials to grow, particularly once the TPP enters into effect.\nRegarding education and training cooperation, we have obtained many important progressions. Take, for example, the Fulbright University in Vietnam has recently received its operating license. The number of Vietnamese students studying in the U.S. has grown 56-fold to 28,000 students, the highest number among the ASEAN countries. And our cooperation in defense and security continues to grow in line with the needs of both sides.\nThe cooperation in remedying the war legacy is now growing more substantively. The two countries have recently completed the phase one of environmental cleanup at Danang Airport, and we will continue to implement the second phase of the project at various other sites, including Bien Hoa Airport. Together with the progress in bilateral ties, Vietnam and U.S. are working together and enhancing the collaboration on regional and international issues of common interest in international forums.\nThe advances in the bilateral relations stem from the fact that we increasingly share common concerns and interests. And both sides have fully realized the commitments to respect each other's independence, sovereignty, political regimes, and legitimate interests. The visit of President Barack Obama this time to Vietnam will surely create stronger momentum for the development and promotion of the Vietnam-U.S. relations in the future, contributing to maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in Asia-Pacific and the wider world.\nThank you very much.\nWhite House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric H. Schultz. The first question on the American side will come from Matt Spetalnick with Reuters.\nQ. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Hi, Matt.\nU.S. Weapons Sales to Vietnam/Vietnam-U.S. Relations/South China Sea Maritime Disputes/Human Rights\nQ. I have a question for both Presidents about the lifting of the arms embargo. To what extent do you see a need to build up Vietnam's military deterrent against China's behavior in the South China Sea as part of this decision? Could this include expanded U.S. access to Vietnamese ports, including Cam Ranh Bay?\nDirectly for President Obama, to what degree will the U.S. decide on weapons sales based on human rights considerations?\nAnd for President Quang, how do you respond to the U.S. push for improved human rights situation in Vietnam? President Obama. Well, Matt, the decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations. It was based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam, a process that began with some very courageous and difficult conversations decades ago, including led by our current Secretary of State John Kerry and Senators Tom Carper and John McCain and a whole bunch of other Vietnam veterans, as well as their counterparts in the Vietnamese Government.\nAnd over time, what we've seen is a progressive deepening and broadening of the relationship. And what became apparent to me and my administration at this point was, is that given all the work we do together across the spectrum of economic, trade, security, humanitarian efforts, that it was appropriate for us not to have a blanket, across-the-board ban. Now, every sale that we make to everybody is viewed as a particular transaction, and we examine what's appropriate and what's not, and there are some very close allies of ours where we may not make a particular sale until we have a better sense of how that piece of equipment may end up being used. So we're going to continue to engage in the case-by-case evaluations of these sales. But what we do not have is a ban that's based on an ideological division between our two countries, because we think that, at this stage, both sides have established a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual respect.\nIn fact, one of the things that's happened through this comprehensive partnership is a dialogue between the U.S. and Vietnamese military that we hadn't seen in a very long time. And we already have U.S. vessels that have come here to port. We expect that there will be deepening cooperation between our militaries, oftentimes around how do we respond to humanitarian disasters in this region. There may be occasions in which that means that additional U.S. vessels might visit, but I want to emphasize that we will do so only at the invitation and with the cooperation of the Vietnamese Government, fully respecting their sovereignty and their sensitivities.\nNow, there is, I think, a genuine mutual concern with respect to maritime issues between the United States and Vietnam, and I've made no secret of that. Vietnam, along with ASEAN, met at my invitation in Sunnylands, California, and we put forward a very clear statement that it is important for us to maintain the freedom of navigation and the governance of international norms and rules and law that have helped to create prosperity and promoted commerce and peace and security in this region. And it's my belief that, with respect to the South China Sea—although the United States doesn't support any particular claim—we are supportive of the notion that these issues should be resolved peacefully, diplomatically, in accordance with international rules and norms, and not based on who's the bigger party and can throw their weight around a little bit more.\nAt the same time, as I indicated in my initial statement, the United States is going to continue to fly and set courses for our ships as international law allows. Our hope is that, ultimately, various claimants and various disputes can be resolved, and we'll do everything that we can to promote that. In the meantime, part of our cooperation with Vietnam is to improve their maritime security posture for a whole host of reasons. But I want to emphasize that my decision to lift the ban really was more reflective of the changing nature of the relationship.\nLast point, with respect specifically to human rights, as I indicated in my opening statement, this is an area where we still have differences. There's been modest progress on some of the areas that we've identified as a concern. TPP actually is one of the things that's\nprompting a series of labor reforms here in Vietnam that could end up being extraordinarily significant. But that is not directly tied to the decision around military sales. Okay?\nPresident Quang. Thank you very much for the question. I just want to make some comments on the human rights cooperation and the general relations between the two countries. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the consistent position and viewpoint of the Vietnamese state and Government is to protect and promote human rights. This is clearly codified and stipulated in the national constitution of Vietnam in 2013. We are now institutionalizing all the regulations into our laws and sublaw documents to respect and promote the human rights in Vietnam.\nOver the past 30 years of reform in Vietnam, Vietnam has achieved remarkable progress in socioeconomic development, defense and security, especially in protection and promotion of human rights and the rights of every citizen in Vietnam. Those achievements have been highly recognized and appreciated by the international community. One of the examples—very good examples—to showcase Vietnam's progress, that Vietnam has been elected as a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2014-2016.\nAs President Obama mentioned earlier, between the two countries, Vietnam and the U.S., we do have the—some differences in some fields, and it is very easy to understand, particularly on human rights. We are of the view that based on the respect and the spirit of mutual understanding, we need to work closely together, expand our dialogue together, and by so doing, we can narrow the gap in understanding and narrowing the differences between the two countries, especially on human rights.\nModerator. And now the floor is still open. I invite other questions. Mr.—[inaudible]—from Vietnam Television. Please, you have the floor.\n[At this point, the reporter asked his question in English, as follows.]\nVietnam-U.S. Relations\nQ. [Inaudible]—introduce myself. I'm from Vietnam Television. [Inaudible] You have visited over 50 countries during your term as U.S. President, and Vietnam is among the last few on the list. So what does this say about the Vietnam-U.S. relations? And how important does the U.S. view on—what Vietnam and its foreign policy? Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Well, I would have liked to have gotten here sooner. And maybe, one of the ways of thinking about it is, we have an expression in the United States: We save the best for last. [Laughter] So it's a remarkable country. It's a beautiful country. And I've told the President that, unfortunately, when I visit, I'm usually in meetings all day long. So hopefully, when I'm no longer President, I can come here with my family, and I can spend a little more time and travel the country a little bit more and get to know the people and eat the food and have a more relaxing schedule.\nBut the reason I'm here is because Vietnam is extremely important not just to the region, but I think to the world. First of all, I think highlighting the changes that have taken place between our two countries, how just a generation ago we were adversaries and now we are friends, should give us hope, should be a reminder of the ability for us to transform relationships when we have a dialogue that's based on mutual interests and mutual respect and people-to-people exchanges.\nSecond, Vietnam is a large, vital, growing country in a large, vital, and growing region of the world. I've said this before: The Asia-Pacific region is growing as fast as any place around the world. It is a young and dynamic region. It is full of entrepreneurial spirit, and you're seeing new companies and new jobs being created constantly. So the United States wants to be a part of that.\nAnd we, historically, have had good relations with many countries in this region. We want to make sure that as Vietnam grows and becomes more prosperous and achieves greater opportunity, that the young people of Vietnam have a chance to partner with the young people of the United States—trading, exchanging ideas, working on scientific projects, starting businesses together—because I think that will be good for both countries.\nAnd we think that it is important, from our perspective, that as a leader in ASEAN, that we engage Vietnam bilaterally because we want to continue to strengthen our cooperation with the multilateral organizations like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN where we think we've seen some very real progress over the last several years on everything from commercial issues to disease control to humanitarian issues.\nOne of the things that we increasingly discover is, it's harder and harder to solve problems by ourselves. It's much easier for us to be able to tackle big problems like climate change or the outbreak of disease or responding to humanitarian disasters when we have a architecture of cooperation already established.\nSo on all these fronts, we've seen remarkable progress. The announcements that we're making today, I think, should give people an indication of the next stage of the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. These are big deals, all the things that we mentioned here today. And it indicates a broader and deeper relationship that I'm confident will continue to grow in the future. Okay?\nMr. Schultz. The final question comes from Angela Greiling-Keane with Bloomberg.\nQ. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Hi, Angela.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement/U.S. Monetary Policy/Death of Taliban Leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansur in Afghanistan\nQ. President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?\nSecondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?\nFor President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\nPresident Obama. So, first of all, on TPP, Angela, I haven't been around as long as Senators Carper or Secretary Kerry, but I've spent enough time in the Senate to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal. And especially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it.\nHaving said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done. And the reason I'm confident is because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good for the world.\nAnd I know I've sold this to you before, but let me reiterate: This is the fastest growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market for the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In other words, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest growing markets of the world, that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers.\nNumber two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulation. Well, if you're signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice, to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts, the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries.\nSo I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. And I'm confident we will get it passed.\nNow, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korean free trade agreement or the Colombian and Panamanian free trade agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although it will—there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way.\nWith respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see a currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why a currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not something that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way. But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations.\nFinally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them.\nOn the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people. And that's exactly the message that has been sent.\nPresident Quang. Let me respond to this question concerning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is a significant trade and economic linkage, contributing to sustaining the dynamism and the role as a driver for economic growth in our country, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. And for Vietnam, TPP and Vietnam's participation in TPP is one step undertaken by the Vietnamese Government in our process of extensive international integration.\nPresident Obama. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting a translation.\nInterpreter. Testing one, two, three.\nPresident Obama. For you?\nInterpreter. Can you hear, Mr. President?\nPresident Obama. Okay.\nInterpreter. Testing one, two, three.\nPresident Obama. It's just, I'm sure that he was saying something very wise and important, and we wanted to make sure that we all heard it.\nPresident Quang. So I would like to add that Vietnam, together with other TPP countries, have been making efforts to narrow differences, to promote cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual respect. And we will try to reduce differences in a spirit of constructiveness and understanding and paying attention to one another's legitimate interests. And the finalization of TPP is also the successful outcomes of all 12 members of the TPP, rather than any individual effort. And we are prepared to ratify TPP, and we stand ready to implement all the commitments under TPP.\nModerator. Your Excellency, now we have a technical problem with the translation system. So, Mr. President—President Quang, could you please repeat again your answer?\nPresident Obama. [Laughter]\nPresident Quang. And, yes, I want to redirect my comments on the TPP. In our view, the TPP is a very significant trade and economic linkage contributing to the sustainment of dynamism and the role as a driver of economic growth in Asia-Pacific region.\nAs for Vietnam, TPP is a one step forward in implementation of the country's deep and comprehensive international integration policy, which aims at promoting the national economic growth of Vietnam. Vietnam has worked together with other member countries to narrow the differences in the spirit of constructiveness, understanding, and paying new attention to one another's legitimate interests. The finalization of TPP is also the result of the endeavors from 12 members of the agreement, rather than the individual effort of any single country. And Vietnam is now very actively promoting and accelerating the ratification of the TPP, and Vietnam is committed to fully implementing all the policies and provisions of the TPP.\nModerator. Thank you very much, President Trần Đại Quang, and President Barack Obama.\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, I declare the press conference adjourned.

The Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, distinguished American guests, ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of the Vietnamese leaders and people, once again, I have the great honor to extend a warm welcome to Mr. President and his high-level delegation. Mr. President, thank you very much for traveling such a long way, across the globe, to visit Vietnam. I'm sure that during your stay here, you'll be able to see for yourself the hospitality and friendship that the Vietnamese people extend to you and to the American people.\nWith a deepened mutual understanding between the two countries and impressive talks between the two sides, your visit marks another crucial milestone in our bilateral relationship and creates a strong momentum for our comprehensive partnership to endure with greater substance in the future, both bilaterally and within the regional and global frameworks.\nTo become comprehensive partners, as we are today, both countries have had to traverse many ups and downs of history and overcome the profound grievances left behind by the war syndromes and prevail over seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Even during those days, the pioneers in promoting the Vietnam-U.S. friendly ties never wavered in the conviction of a brighter future for the bilateral relations. The reversed development of the Vietnam-U.S. relations in the past years is clear evidence of President Ho Chi Minh's statement, \"Bear the cold winter, and we shall be welcomed by warm spring.\"\nProceeding from the tradition of peace and friendship, the Vietnamese people always wish to cultivate the friendship with peoples around the world, including the American people. We will always remember and are grateful to American people's contributions to putting an end to an unhappy chapter in the two countries' history. While the wounds of the war have not been fully healed in both countries and differences remain in the bilateral relations, as time goes by we have become more deeply aware of the past and present and have conviction that a friendly and cooperative relationship between our two nations will be in the best interest of both peoples, as well as that of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the Asia-Pacific and the world.\nMr. President, as you once said—and allow me to quote—\"If you're walking down the right path, and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you will make progress.\" And I would like to recall a historical event in February 1946. In his letter to President Harry Truman, President Ho Chi Minh expressed his wish that Vietnam and the United States of America would develop a full cooperation. With the establishment of the comprehensive partnership, we're taking the path that President Ho Chi Minh had chosen. We're confident that relations on the basis of friendship, equality, cooperation, and respect for each other's political regimes and legitimate interests is the only path leading to a brighter and more prosperous future for our next generations. Our nations have a bright future. And together, we can write new chapters of our relationship.\nWith that, I would like to kindly invite Mr. President, distinguished American guests, and you all to join me in a toast. To the friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and the United States of America. To the good health of Mr. President and to you all. Thank you.\n[At this point, President Quang offered a toast.]\nPresident Obama. Good afternoon. President Quang, General Secretary Trọng, Prime Minister Phúc, Chairwoman Kim Ngân, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. To you and to the Government and the people of Vietnam, I want to thank you for your kind welcome and hospitality that you've extended to me and my delegation today. Xin cảm ơn.\nI'm told there is a saying here in Vietnam—which I will not say in Vietnamese—but it says, \"When you eat the fruit, think about the one who planted the tree.\" And today we pay our respects to all who came before us—Vietnamese and Americans—who planted and tended the tree that has become our comprehensive partnership.\nI especially want to thank all those who served both our countries decades ago and then took on one last mission, and that was the mission to help our nations reconcile. For you, that conflict was a bitter memory. But today Vietnam and America show the world that hearts can change and peace is possible. And we thank Secretary Kerry and all our veterans here today, both Vietnamese and American, who had the courage not only to fight, but more importantly, had the courage to make peace.\nI think oftentimes our veterans can show us the way. One American veteran came here and described meeting a former North Vietnamese soldier. \"He came up and shook my hand, and now we're friends,\" this veteran said. \"Without the high-powered politicians, people can just get along as human beings.\"\nThe Vietnamese and Americans are now following that advice, getting along as human beings: as students and scholars, as entrepreneurs and innovators, as doctors and as scientists, as sailors and peacekeepers on behalf of the security and peace that we seek around the world.\nI know that here in Vietnam, you draw inspiration from the lotus flower—hoa sen. It takes root in the mud and thus is a symbol of hope amid hardship. It survives where other flowers cannot and thus is a symbol of strength and endurance. It radiates color and is thus a symbol of beauty.\nSo I'd like to propose a toast: To the spirit of the lotus, in the perseverance and the hopes of the Vietnamese people, in the strength and endurance of the partnership between our two nations, and in the beauty of both of our peoples and the desire to live in peace, dignity, and justice.

On the occasion of the visit and the May 23, 2016 meeting between the two leaders, the United States and Vietnam adopted this Joint Statement.\nBoth sides noted with satisfaction the rapid, substantive, and comprehensive growth of U.S.-Vietnam relations over the past year, guided by the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership of 2013 and the Joint Vision Statement issued during the historic visit to the United States by General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Phu Trong in July 2015.\nThe common interests of the United States and Vietnam continued to expand through intensifying exchanges of delegations at all levels and maintaining dialogue mechanisms; promoting economic growth thanks to enhanced trade and investment relations; and deepening cooperation in education, science and technology, health, security and national defense, people-to-people ties, human rights, humanitarian, and war legacy issues. The increasingly enhanced U.S.-Vietnam relations have positively contributed to the joint efforts of the international community in maintaining peace, stability, cooperation, and respect for international law in the region, and building a rules-based region. Together, we are addressing regional and global challenges, including climate change, sustainable development, global health, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, peacekeeping, and wildlife trafficking.\nToward that end, the two countries reaffirmed their obligations to observe the UN Charter and commitments to respect international law, their respective political systems, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The United States and Vietnam also committed to strengthening and developing the ASEAN Community, and to working with the international community to respond to global challenges.

The two sides stated that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is economically and strategically important, and would promote trade and investment between them, accelerate inclusive economic growth, and create jobs. The two sides reaffirmed their commitments to seek early ratification and full implementation of this high-standard agreement, including commitments on investment, business facilitation and development, intellectual property, textile, services, labor, and environment. The United States pledged to support Vietnam through robust technical assistance and capacity-building programs to effectively implement and meet the high standards of the TPP.

The two sides highlighted that development cooperation continues to be a driving force in the bilateral relationship. Both countries pledged to promote bilateral trade and investment, and would continue to work toward access for industrial, agricultural, and aquacultural goods. The United States and Vietnam committed to consult through the enhanced bilateral working group in a cooperative and comprehensive manner regarding Vietnam's desire to be recognized as a market economy.

The United States welcomed the Vietnamese government's approval of the Peace Corps to teach the English language in Vietnam. The United States and Vietnam hailed the establishment of Fulbright University Vietnam, which will be a world-class Vietnamese university. Both sides welcomed the bilateral arrangement granting one-year, multiple-entry visas for short-term business and tourism travelers from both countries. Both sides highly valued and recognized the success of the Vietnamese-American community and their contributions to the promotion of bilateral ties.\nEnhancing Security and Defense Cooperation\nThe United States and Vietnam reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen defense cooperation between the two countries as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding on Advancing Bilateral Defense Cooperation in 2011 and the U.S.-Vietnam Joint Vision Statement on Defense Relations signed in 2015, giving priority to humanitarian cooperation, war legacy, maritime security, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Both sides reiterated they would continue to strengthen cooperation in the fields of security, combatting transnational crime, and cyber security. Vietnam welcomed the U.S. government decision to fully lift the ban on the sale of lethal weapons to Vietnam. Vietnam welcomed U.S. maritime security assistance—including through the Maritime Security Initiative (MSI), the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, and Foreign Military Financing—and looked forward to working with the United States to enhance Vietnam's maritime capabilities. The United States and Vietnam signed a letter of intent to establish a working group for the Cooperative Humanitarian and Medical Storage Initiative (CHAMSI), which will advance cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The United States reaffirmed its support for Vietnam's peacekeeping efforts with an aim of assisting Vietnam's first deployment of UN peacekeeping forces by 2017.\nBoth countries expressed their satisfaction with their joint efforts to advance humanitarian and war legacy issues. In particular, the United States valued Vietnam's active cooperation to support the humanitarian mission of providing the fullest possible accounting for U.S. personnel still missing from the war. Both sides committed to continue their cooperation on unexploded ordnance removal. Vietnam welcomed cooperation leading to the successful conclusion of the first phase of dioxin remediation at Danang International Airport, with the final phase already underway. The United States committed to partnering with Vietnam to make a significant contribution to the clean-up of dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nPromoting Human Rights and Legal Reform\nBoth countries pledged to continue supporting the promotion and protection of human rights in conformity with their own constitutions and respective international commitments. The two countries welcomed the results of positive, frank, and constructive dialogues on human rights, especially the 20th round of the U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue in April 2016, to narrow differences and continue to build trust. The United States welcomed Vietnam's ongoing efforts in improving its legal system and undertaking legal reform in order to better guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone in accordance with the 2013 Constitution. Vietnam informed the United States of its plan to revise, amend, and draft new laws, including the Law on Religion and Belief, Law on Association, the Amended Law on Legal Aid, the Amended Law on Legal Record, and Law on the Promulgation of Administrative Decisions. Both sides recognized the contributions that social and religious organizations continue to make in the fields of education, healthcare, and social services in both countries.

The United States and Vietnam welcomed a letter of agreement on law enforcement and justice sector assistance.\nAddressing Regional and Global Challenges\nThe United States and Vietnam reaffirmed their shared commitment to the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes, including full respect for diplomatic and legal processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force in accordance with the UN Charter and international laws, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Both countries underscored the commitments of parties to the disputes to refrain from actions that aggravate or broaden the disputes and recognize the importance of strictly implementing the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) and working to accelerate negotiation with substantive results toward the early conclusion of the Code of Conduct (COC). In this regard, both countries expressed serious concerns over recent developments in the South China Sea that have caused tensions, eroded trust and threatened peace, security, and stability. Both countries recognized the imperative of upholding the freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded lawful commerce in the South China Sea, called for non-militarization and self-restraint in addressing disputes, reaffirmed shared commitments under the Sunnylands Declaration, and committed to working closely with other ASEAN partners in implementing that Declaration.\nThe United States reaffirmed its commitment to actively coordinate with and support Vietnam in successfully organizing APEC 2017.\nThe United States and Vietnam reaffirmed their commitment to addressing climate change and implementing the Paris Agreement.

The United States and Vietnam pledged to take a number of practical actions to advance climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as enhance transparency and capacity building in the U.S.-Vietnam Climate Partnership, including in the Mekong River Delta. Future work will build on the results of collaboration between the United States and Vietnam in implementing programs under the Lower Mekong Initiative. The United States pledged its continued support for Vietnam in responding to the latter's worst drought in over 90 years and salinization, and in advancing sustainable economic development in the lower Mekong basin. As a development partner of the Mekong River Commission (MRC), the United States expressed its commitment to supporting cooperation among MRC members and between MRC members and other regional mechanisms in using, managing, and developing trans-boundary water resources in an effective and sustainable manner.\nThe two countries expressed support for an expanding civil nuclear partnership as we seek to reduce emissions from the global power sector, the signing of the Administrative Arrangement under the U.S.-Vietnam Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (\"123\" Agreement), and the highest standards of nuclear safety, security, and nonproliferation.

SCHULTZ: We are very fortunate to be joined by the Secretary of State, who is going to give us an update on the President's visit after day two of three, here in Vietnam. He's also going to offer some personal reflections on what this trip has meant and the progress we've seen, I'd say, in the years since you've led this effort a few decades ago.\nSo I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Kerry, who will have time for just a few questions. And then Ben and I will stick around for a few extra questions.\nSECRETARY KERRY: Eric, thank you very much. Sorry to sidetrack there for a minute.\nGood evening, everybody. It's really a pleasure for me to be here with all of you, but it's also a tremendous privilege to be here with President Obama on what is unquestionably an historic demarcation effort.\nI have to tell you that for many years I have looked forward to a time when people would hear the word \"Vietnam\" or the name \"Vietnam\" and think more of a country than a conflict. And with President Obama's visit this week, with the crowds that we saw along the street today, the remarkably warm and generous welcome, the unbelievable excitement of people that we are here with a President of the United States at this moment is absolutely palpable, and I think it is a demarcation point.\nI think, clearly, we will never fail to honor the sacrifice of those who fought here and of what their dreams were for this country. But I think one can say genuinely, definitively, without failing to honor past service, that we have reached a new point in our relationship now.\nI will tell you that when I first came over here around 1990 or so, not that many Americans had traveled at that point in time officially, from the government of the United States certainly. And in Hanoi, there literally were very few cars. None of the street lights worked. People were still in black pajamas. There was a law that said they couldn't talk to foreigners. And the embargo was in full force. There were just bicycles, massive numbers of bicycles and people riding to work. Very few hotels in the city. I stayed in a government guesthouse. And the transition from that moment -- when America decided we were going to sort of start to become engaged -- until now is nothing less than stunning.\nThis is a country that is practicing a raging form of capitalism. It is engaged and has been called the tiger of this region. And I think that, by every measure, this is a significant emphasis on the policy of President Obama with respect to the rebalance to Asia. This is a prime example of the way in which the United States has been able to forge a new relationship out of the ashes of war and to create real peace.\nAnd when people ask what does it mean to have lifted the lethal weapons ban -- what it means is it's normal. We don't have lethal embargoes or bans for countries that we treat normally. And after 20 years of recognition, it is time to honor that normality. The fact is that it is also a very important decision in terms of making certain that Vietnam has the equipment that it needs in order to be able to defend itself and to stand up as part of ASEAN, as part of a rule of law, a rules-based structure -- which is what President Obama has been trying to seek both in TPP, as well as in our overall policy.\nSo this visit and this moment, in my judgement, reaffirms what has been clear for some period of time to many of us: The United States and Vietnam no longer define our relationship by the enmities of a bygone era.\nNow, I often point out that the young adults of America and Vietnam were both born after normal relations were established 20 years ago, and what was extraordinary to my generation could not be more routine or natural to them. And all you have to do is look and measure this transformation that has taken place.\nTwenty years ago, there were fewer than 60,000 American visitors to Vietnam on an annual basis; today, there's nearly half a million. Twenty years ago, bilateral trade in goods was only $450 million; today, it's more than $45 billion a year. Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 800 Vietnamese students studying in the United States; today, nearly 19,000. And through the Lower Mekong Initiative -- a place that I know well -- we are working to improve Vietnam's resilience to the effects of climate change, focusing our aid on clean energy and the development of sustainable infrastructure and ecosystem resource management.\nWe're also working together, excitingly, in the academic arena. And I can't emphasize how key that is in terms of transformational long-term impact of a relationship. The Institute of International Education, Arizona State University, Harvard Medical School, the University of Hawaii all have partnerships with institutions in Vietnam, several involving participation by the private sector. And tomorrow, I will have the privilege of launching the formal launch of Fulbright University Vietnam, which will be a full-fledged, non-profit and totally academically free institution.\nOur two countries are also cooperating on security issues -- something that none of us could have imagined 45, 50 years ago. Our Coast Guards and our Navies are working together. Vietnam is a partner in America's Global Peace Operations Initiative. In 2014, Vietnam began contributing to U.N. peace operations in a small way, but with plans to send engineering, medical, and other specialized units in the future. And along with allies and partners, the United States is helping personnel from Vietnam to prepare for those deployments. And one of the things we did in the course of this visit is sign an agreement which will permit the pre-deployment of supplies in the event of emergency.\nSo let me just emphasize that measure this visit alone, major business agreements -- Pratt & Whitney, Boeing, wind energy, the Fulbright University, the Peace Corps coming to Vietnam, the Mekong Delta Initiative, Fulbright University, TPP -- it seems to me that that alone, without all the other things I added, defines rebalance impact and a relationship that is really nothing less than transformational.\nNow, there is no question, as the President said earlier today, that our government and the government in Hanoi continue to have differences, obviously. The fact that we are cooperating in all of these other areas doesn't mean there is a sudden erasing of fundamental differences in how we organize our governments, how we deal directly with our citizens. And so the good news, however, is we're talking about that. We talk about that very directly. We talked about it today. We talked about it yesterday.\nAnd today, you saw the President meet with some folks in their civil society -- people who represented disabilities, people who represented church, and so forth. That could not have been imagined 20 years ago. That meeting today, while it lacked three people that had been invited and we hoped had been there, was still a remarkably significant meeting because it took place. And that's the first time a President of the United States sat down with civil society in the capital of this country and talked in an open way as he did today.\nIt is clear that we and Vietnam are engaged today in a way I can tell you that none of us could have imagined during the war. And it is clear that Vietnam is reaching towards this globalized world of modernity. After all, millions of people in Vietnam already freely use -- I think it's something like 38 million people and some 29 million or so under the age of 25 who use Facebook. So thousands of Vietnamese workers are already freely associating to defend their interests. And under TPP, those rights will be increased, as well as environmental protection.\nSo the Vietnamese are the ones who are asking for the guarantees of a government to put into law the recognition of their freedoms. And there will be, shortly, an effort within the parliament to codify certain rights in ways that are reflected in the constitution of the country.\nSo the more progress that occurs in those areas, the more likely it is -- as President Obama explained very clearly -- the more likely it is that our bilateral relationship, which has already come so far, is going to be able to reach even greater potential. And that's why we're here. That's why this is significant. And that's why I think this is worth the fight.\nSo with that, I am happy to open it up.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The China Daily is warning the United States not to spark a fire in Asia. And I'm quoting now: \"The United States and Vietnam must not spark a regional tinderbox\" -- noting the concerns of trying to curb the rise of China. What's your reaction to what the China Daily has written? And if I could follow, based on what you've observed in the time since 1990, is there any doubt in your mind that there will be an even greater openness here in Vietnam in the years to come? And how can you manage that as a country that still has so many fundamental differences between governments?\nSECRETARY KERRY: Between -- I'm sorry.\nQ: The U.S. and Vietnam.\nSECRETARY KERRY: Well, look, we're making progress. Last year -- I mean, they released -- I'm going to take the second part of your question first. They released a number of prisoners. They had about 160, I think; 60 or so were released. There had been increased freedoms of worship. The church has been recognized. Handicapped efforts have been recognized. So there's some progress. Is it as much progress as we want? No, not at all. And there is going to be a journey ahead of us while we continue to work on those things. But I really think that's at the center of President Obama's foreign policy. That's what we're doing in Burma. That's what we're doing in Cuba. That's what we're doing in Iraq and in other places, Afghanistan, where transformation is taking place.\nFolks, I got to tell you, we are impatient by nature, and that's good. We get a lot done in America because we are impatient. But you can't be impatient -- you can be impatient, but you've got to also recognize the time it takes for cultural transformation, for generational transformation, for people to be able to learn how to manage and exercise rights and certain freedoms. And we went through that ourselves. I mean, how can we turn away from our own history? It was only in the 1960s, when I was in college, that we began the battle -- or the next evolution of the battle to have full voting rights in America and full civil rights, and Jim Crow. That wasn't so long ago in our history, for a country that began with the Constitution we began with.\nSo for countries that don't begin with that, or don't have any of that tradition, we have to recognize that road that they're on is going to be a roller coaster ride to some degree. But as long as it's moving in the same direction, that's what is important. As long as the United States itself remains faithful to our values and we are always pushing in the right direction, as the President did today, I think we can absolutely look forward with confidence to this transformation taking hold.\nI personally, I do not know how -- I mean, I was sitting on the Commerce Committee of the Senate when we rewrote the rules for telecommunications. We didn't even think about information management. And this was 1996. Look at where we are 20 years later in our own revolution in terms of that technology and communication. I came into a Senate that didn't have an Internet, and look at where we are. So life changes, and it will change here -- because you cannot function in the modern, globalized marketplace of today without opening up ultimately, and without being able to be competitive in terms of purchase, sales, communications, and so forth.\nNow, on the first part of your question about China, I'd say several things. First of all, this is not about China. Nothing that we did here or are doing here is focused on China. It is focused on the fastest-growing marketplace in the world. It is focused on a rules-based order that we have consistently -- Republican and Democrat, President alike -- held at the center of our policies. And it is focused on strengthening the ability in this region to be able to promote that rules-based order.\nNow, part of that rules-based order, frankly, requires the peaceful resolution of the problems of the South China Sea. We have consistently urged in private conversations and public conversation with China that they respect the rule of law and that they engage diplomatically with the countries that are contesting claims and that they not move unilaterally.\nIf you want to point to the possibilities of tinderbox and of perhaps igniting something, I would caution China, as President Obama and others have, to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and militarization of islands and areas that are part of the claims that are in contest today. We don't take a position on those claims. China should note that. We're not saying China is wrong in its claims; we're simply saying, resolve it peacefully, resolve it through a rules-based structure.\nSo nothing we've done here is out of the ordinary. We have lifted an embargo, which was out of the ordinary. The embargo itself, the lethal arms embargo, was a restraint on normality. Now we have a normal relation, so we lift it. That's very normal. Not out of order, and certainly not inflammatory. And I hope China will read this correctly, because our hope is for normal respect for maritime law and for the relationships that are so key in this region in terms of resolving the code of conduct and moving forward in a diplomatic way to resolve these differences.\nQ: Secretary Kerry, while we have you, on another topic -- the battle against ISIS and terrorism. So what extent now, when you look at the Egypt air crash, is the thinking that this was or was not an act of terrorism? And we're hearing a lot about the battle for Fallujah beginning. How do you see that playing out? How long is that going to take? Why now? And do you think this is really -- there's been a lot said about how the administration has turned the tide in this effort.\nSECRETARY KERRY: I don't have any information -- particularly on the road like this, I just have no way of authoritatively commenting at all on the EgyptAir crash. I've seen catches of the news, and I'm reading what people are reading. But I don't think it's my job to surmise. I think that has too many consequences. So let's let the investigators investigate and let them do what they're doing, and we'll see where we are.\nWith respect to ISIS, what Fallujah means is that we're continuing the process that President Obama has put in play to defeat ISIS. And we're going to defeat them. I've said that again and again. And I think I've been backed up week to week by the increased efforts that we are seeing be successful -- with communities in Iraq being returned to their inhabitants, with ISIS being compressed in its area of activity, though it is still lethal. We know that. And we see them lashing out, to some degree, because they're not able to take territory. They're not able to mount lasting holding actions. They can attack and move, and that's still dangerous, and we see them with suicide attacks, obviously. And unfortunately, that will continue, as we continue to press the battle against them.\nBut I think what Fallujah means is that our generals and our cooperation with the Iraqis and with the full coalition of 66 countries have a clear strategy. They're moving very systematically. And I believe we're making progress. And the President has instructed all of us to try to think about ways in which we could accelerate that, for obvious reasons. The faster we can eliminate Daesh as a threat force, the better off the world would be, because it has impacts on economies, it has impacts on travel, it has an impact on the threat and safety. And so that's the President's instructions to us, and that's what we're trying to do.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you said that this is not about China. But it's hard not to see many of the President's comments: \"Big nations should not bully smaller ones.\" \"Vietnam is an independent and sovereign nation, and no other nation can impose its will on you.\" These were all big lines that got a lot of applause today, and they got a lot of applause because the audience clearly understood that the President was talking about China and Vietnam. And so huge parts of this trip are clearly directed at pushing back on China, both in the South China Sea. And the President is going to be going to Japan. He's going to talk about proliferation. In this region, the most important proliferation problem is in North Korea, which is Chinese technology gotten through Pakistan, and China has the most leverage in the North Korea situation. So again and again -- even TPP is a trade organization that you all have sort set up without China, in the Pacific. So it's hard not to see each one of the things that you're talking about, the speeches that you're making -- and even now you're talking about you immediately pivot to the South China Sea -- without seeing China being a huge part of this trip.\nSECRETARY KERRY: Well, I think what's happening is you're confusing, if you don't mind my saying so, respectfully, the focus and the direction of what we're doing versus some of the impact, collaterally, of what we do. I'd obviously be either misleading you or pretty stupid if I didn't suggest that order in the South China Sea and encouraging peaceful resolution and making sure that ASEAN is strong doesn't collaterally have an impact on perceptions there. But it's not focused on China.\nPresident Obama could not have been more clear. I've said it a hundred times -- and we mean it: We welcome the rise of a strong China, a China that assumes responsibilities as a global superpower leader, and plays out its responsibilities in ways that are helpful. And that means encouraging peace and stability. As long as China is playing by those rules and adopting it, none of this is focused on China. So it's really something we have worked on in our country and stood for since World War II. I mean, we've been working on this rules-based structure, freedom of navigation, codes of conduct, peaceful resolution, diplomatic process. That's the hallmark of American policy for throughout the Cold War and beyond.\nSo it's not specifically focused on China. Obviously there is a collateral impact to the degree China chooses to do X, Y or Z. And so we're very clear -- we encourage China not to be unilaterally militarizing, unilaterally moving. But we're not focused on China. I just can't say it enough. We're focused on this region. And I think the primary threat of the entire region is North Korea, Kim Jong-un, and the proliferation activities of the DPRK. That's the primary threat. It's actually perhaps the lead threat globally with respect to one of the two or three currently.\nI think these guys are going to take over here. I answered more than I thought I was doing.\nThank you. Good to see you. Thank you very much.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ben and I are your second act and happy to take any remaining questions.\nNancy.\nQ: Eric, did the administration push back at all -- with the activists that who were denied access to the meeting this morning -- with the Vietnamese government, register a protest or anything?\nMR. RHODES: Yes, absolutely. We've made clear that when the President travels around the world, he meets with government and he meets with civil society. And we've done that here in Vietnam. We've done it in Cuba. We did it in Myanmar. We did it in Ethiopia. And we set up a similar meeting here. This morning -- or overnight, really, we learned that there were a number of individuals who were being prevented from, or dissuaded from attending the meeting with the President. We protested to the government. Ultimately we were able to meet with the group of people that the President had this morning, which included advocates around issues like freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, disability rights, freedom of worship. But there were a number of individuals who were not able to attend.\nQ: Was that --\nMR. RHODES: No. No, I think the Secretary identified the number of people. What I'd say, though, is number one, as Secretary Kerry pointed out, the fact of an American President or any head of state or government meeting with independent civil society in Hanoi is unprecedented. And so, clearly, this was something that was a source of significant discomfort for the government. And that alone I think demonstrates that we're able, through this relationship, to hear from different voices and to lift up these different issues. And I think certainly the President benefited from this conversation today, and made the point that we're going to continue to remain engaged with civil society.\nTo the second point I'd make, going forward, even as we are elevating this relationship in a host of ways -- our security cooperation, our commercial ties, our people-to-people ties -- clearly human rights is going to continue to be on the agenda. And that's part of what we wanted to demonstrate today, that we're not beyond all of our differences, we're going to continue to raise them.\nAnd then the final point I'd make on this is we believe very strongly that we are going to be better-positioned to advance human rights through a policy of engagement; that if we were to withhold the relationship with the United States and try to use the fact of cooperation in different areas to pressure the government to do certain things, we would be less able to, over time, encourage positive reform than if we're here and we're engaged.\nAnd if you look at the transformation that's taking place here that Secretary Kerry talked about, that includes things that are very empowering like the ability for people to have access to Facebook, like the enormous interconnectivity that you have between young people here and young people across the region and around the world. The opening that takes place is creating a space for discussion and debate and dialogue that is new. And as the Secretary said, we've seen some progress in recent years, but certainly not sufficient progress. And we're going to continue to press the government on all those issues.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Can I just add one thing for Nancy, which is the President, I think it's noteworthy, chose to raise this in front of all of you -- meaning he thinks it's significant enough to make sure that all of you knew about this. And I think that's indicative of the fact that he's going to press on this and make it a priority moving forward.\nMichelle.\nQ: Last night, during his speech to the Vietnamese people, he seemed to be approaching this extremely delicately. Given that this had just happened, and given that just yesterday the BBC was told by the government to stop reporting -- I mean, it's kind of happening boldly while he's here. But he approached the whole thing by first talking about the problems that were in the U.S. I mean, that's how he opened the discussion. And then he didn't get very specific or critical in any way. He just said -- he kind of extolled the virtues of certain freedoms in a general sense. It seemed like he was much harder on the subject and more specific in places like Kenya, for example. Was there a reason he had to approach this so delicately?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, I think there's been a consistent way in which the President raises these issues anywhere -- Cuba, Vietnam, Kenya. He discusses what we stand for, what we believe, and the universal values that he thinks that all people should be able to have access to, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. So I don't think he was speaking delicately in any way.\nIn fact, that speech was broadcast here in Vietnam, and those are not things that people in Vietnam hear frequently. They do not hear leaders of the stature of President Obama discussing those values openly in Hanoi with that kind of platform.\nSecondly, look, we have a very complicated history in Vietnam. And I think it's important that the President make clear here that we recognize that history and we're not coming here to impose a system of government on Vietnam, but rather we're coming here to engage the Vietnamese people. And part of that engagement is going to be advocacy around these issues. And people know what we stand for. They know that we raise individual human rights cases. They know that we advocate for the types of reforms that we'd like to see here.\nFor instance, if you look at TPP, a main sticking point here in Vietnam was the fact that in order to come into TPP they had to allow for independent labor unions; they had to allow for fair wages; they had to allow for limitations on workers' hours. Those are human rights advances that were embedded with TPP. That's how engagement allows us to advance the types of reforms that we'd like to see.\nAnd the last thing I'd say about this, Michelle, is Vietnam is not going to change its political system overnight, and it's not going to change its political system because we tell them to. What's going to ultimately bring greater change and reform to Vietnam is the Vietnamese people. We've already seen that progress take place in the last two decades, during normalization. In some ways, we've seen it accelerate in recent years as people are more connected and expect more of their government. We've seen laws pass that begin to address issues of human rights, including the ability of people to protest their detention. And ultimately we'd like to see laws pass that address issues like freedom of speech and assembly.\nBut it's going to take time for Vietnam to evolve. But the final thing I'd say about this is, I think the Vietnamese people know what the President stands for. And if you look at the reception that he got in Hanoi and the reception that he got coming into Ho Chi Minh City, I've traveled all over the world with President Obama, and other than Myanmar, I can't think of another country that received him like that. And those are people who know exactly what he stands for and believe that he's helping the Vietnamese people achieve a better future.\nQ: Another question on about Navy access here in Vietnam. We just got back from the Philippines, involved in exercises, and we have now the ability to access five bases in the Philippines we gave up in 1991. Now we're back in. Another one is the South China Sea. Many of the allies we've got are giving us more access to bases and use for the Navy. What's going to happen in Vietnam? When and how, and how big?\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, I obviously don't want to compare the relationship that we have with the Philippines, a treaty ally, to Vietnam. What I would say is we are deepening our cooperation with Vietnam in a number of areas. One of those includes maritime security and having discussions around how we can help enhance their capability with respect to maritime security.\nWe've also had conversations about disaster response and how we can perhaps pre-position certain resources that can make Vietnam more effective in working with other ASEAN partners in responding to natural disasters.\nI think, going forward, as we consider the relationship between the United States Nave and Vietnam, that's going to be an evolving conversation. And when it comes to discussions related to what types of cooperation we might pursue, what types of port calls there may be, I think that's going to be an unfolding process in the coming months and years. But the fact of the matter is, by deepening our collaboration with Vietnam and with ASEAN, by removing this vestige of the Cold War with the lethal arms ban, we're able to have a conversation with Vietnam like we have with other countries within ASEAN, and we expect them to be an important partner of the United States just like we've been deepening cooperation with other ASEAN countries.\nMR. SCHULTZ: We have time for one or two more.\nMargaret.\nQ: Ben, can you tell us if you got any specific commitment on this trip from the Vietnamese government on human rights, and whether that leverage, specifically when it comes to weapons, is gone? Or is this like a case-by-case basis -- every time they ask for another piece of policing equipment, we have a conversation with them about freedom of assembly? How does that work? And can you also give us your read on the level of instability in North Korea, given that the Secretary just said it's the lead global threat?\nMR. RHODES: Well, on North Korea, I think he's referring to the fact of their nuclear program and that they're certainly the leading threat as it relates to nuclear proliferation.\nWith respect to commitments, yes, the government did indicate to us that it was committed to pursuing additional reforms in this space. In some cases, that involves the implementation of laws that have been passed that allow for more rights. In some cases, they were referencing individuals who we have raised with them. And in some cases, they were referring to upcoming legislative efforts that they might pursue.\nSo it's a broad discussion around the trajectory of progress here in Vietnam that focused both on individual human rights cases of concern -- like Father Lэ who was released the other day -- but also legal reform that codifies certain rights, like the ability of people to protest their detention, seek greater transparency from the government, seek the right to assemble, seek the ability to have a civil society that is independent of the government.\nSo this will be an ongoing conversation. The government indicates to us that they are moving in a direction on a number of these issues. We will wait and see whether or not they follow through on those commitments. We didn't define this relationship as a strict quid pro quo as it relates to our engagement as against specific steps. But what they certainly understand is the ability of us to cooperate depends upon continued progress on a range of issues.\nAnd so just as TPP requires them to fulfill their labor commitments -- because if they are not allowing for the registration of independent labor unions, and if they're not allowing for the types of workers' rights that are codified in TPP, they won't get the benefits of TPP, because TPP is enforceable. So they have to do those things, they have to implement those laws in order to get those protections lifted and have the market access that comes with the agreement. That's an indication of how a broadening relationship maintains the ability for us to raise human rights concerns.\nIn the lethal weapons ban, we have now lifted the prohibition on the sale of weapons. But as with any other country, we do review each weapons sale on a case-by-case basis. So it will continue to be the case that as we are considering certain arms sales to Vietnam we will look at a variety of factors, and it's certainly going to be the case if our administration, Congress, future administrations, I'm sure, will look at the trajectory of the human rights picture in Vietnam as they make those decisions. So that continues to be the case going forward.\nAgain, we believe that, broadly speaking, what we've done through normalization with Vietnam is empowering the Vietnamese people. And it is ultimately leading to a future where they're going to have greater rights and opportunities, and that we can push that process forward much more effectively by deepening the relationship than by pulling back.\nQ: Any other -- to be free?\nMR. RHODES: Again, they've released a number of prisoners over the last year. We would like to see an additional number of political prisoners released. I'm not going to make predictions about specific cases. But it's fair to say, here, as in other countries in this part of the world, we are regularly raising through human rights dialogue and other channels, including on this visit, cases that are of concern to us.\nQ: Can you shed some light on the pushback related to last night, such as who was involved and what the Vietnamese government's response was? And secondly, the President said a number of times that the United States is demonstrating its commitment to fully normalizing relations. Can you explain what is left to do to fully normalize relations? Is it just a matter of implementing decisions that have already been made, or are there additional policy decisions that need to be made?\nMR. RHODES: Well, again, as we became aware of individuals who were facing obstacles in attending the meeting we raised those concerns at a variety of levels. Secretary Kerry was certainly involved in those efforts, as were people in the White House. This is something that we've done in many countries. We faced obstacles and concerns around participants in those types of meetings in other countries, and we raised them through the White House and through the State Department.\nUltimately, we were not able to have every participant at this meeting. But I do want to be very clear that we have to use or engagement as a means of raising these issues. If the President wasn't pursuing this policy, he wouldn't be sitting in Hanoi with a series of civil society and human rights activists talking about these issue and talking about them publicly, and giving a speech about it that reached the Vietnamese people. So if we just stayed in Washington and expressed our concerns we'd never have the opportunity to have that type of conversation. And that's a conversation that has never taken place before in Hanoi -- which is precisely why the government was so uncomfortable with it.\nAnd we deeply believe that by being engaged, by coming here, we are having a conversation that would not otherwise happen. We are able to hear the voices of those civil society activists. That gives a greater platform to their ideas, just as we're able to engage with and hear the ideas of the government.\nAnd if you look at the Vietnamese people, again, if our focus is on how are we helping the Vietnamese people, there are few countries in the world where the United States is as highly regarded as here in Vietnam. You see that in every public opinion survey; you see it on the streets here today. I think that is a testament to the fact that the Vietnamese believe this relationship benefits them.\nQ: Can you say what it was that did to -- were they physically arrested and hauled off to jail? Was it house arrest? Warned? And to the best of your knowledge now, are they free to move about?\nMR. RHODES: Look, Matt, I would just say that there are a variety of ways in which governments seek to make clear to people that they shouldn't attend a certain meeting. I personally am not familiar enough with each individual case, I think, to be able to give an accurate rendering that I know to be completely true. What we do know is that, using a variety of different methods, a number of people felt either prevented from or uncomfortable attending the meeting. And President Obama volunteered that to the press because he wanted people to know that not everybody who was invited was able to attend.\nWe will certainly be following up and have followed up to make sure that all of those individuals are free and they're not being in any way subject to any punishment. And I think that's something that our embassy does on a regular basis. These are individuals who are regular sources of information to not just the United States but to advocates on these issues around the world. And they're the ones who have the courage, frankly, to take those positions. They're the ones who assume the hardship of staking out positions that may put them on the other side of the government here.\nBut what our commitment is, is, number one, that we're going to engage them just as we engage the government as part of normalization. Number two, we're going to continue to raise these issues privately with the government. And number three, that President Obama discusses these issues publicly as well.\nAnd, look, the public engagement that we have here should not be underestimated. When you talk about a Fulbright University opening, it's the first independently accredited university that has the ability to exercise a freedom of academic pursuits that is not subject to government restrictions. When you talk about our exchange programs, that's connecting people from Vietnam to other countries and to the United States, and we have 12,000 people participating in that exchange program. So there are all kinds of ways that we are able to demonstrate our commitment to universal values, including advocacy on individual cases.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Carol asked about normalizing.\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, we have, I think, in many ways removed many of the vestiges of the past as it relates to Vietnam. The prohibition on lethal arms sales was certainly a vestige of the Cold War. And, frankly, the Vietnamese agreement to allow the Peace Corps to come here I think demonstrates on their side that they are putting behind a vestige of the Cold War.\nAt the same time, having a normal relationship with another country does not necessarily define the extent to which your partnership develops. So, for instance, we were discussing earlier our military and security cooperation. We are at a nascent stage of that collaboration. As we develop a closer relationship with Vietnam and as we look at all of the different factors in our relationship, I think that will have a bearing on just how close the collaboration is between our militaries on a variety of issues.\nSimilarly, again, as I said on TPP, as they implement their commitments, that will have a direct bearing on how much they are able to benefit from the agreement, assuming it's approved by the respective parliaments and our Congress.\nSo, again, we have, I think, removed the barriers to this relationship, but at the same time, we haven't established just how far it can evolve. And at the end of the day, we always have the closest relationships with countries with whom we share broad interests and a shared set of values. And as this relationship evolves, I think we'll see how far it can go.\nNow, as Secretary Kerry said, if you look at how far it's come in just the last 20 years, it suggests that there's enormous potential here in Vietnam. And look, we're -- I know we're spending a lot of time, as we appropriately should be, discussing the very serious differences between our governments, but it is worth stepping back and reflecting on just how extraordinary it is, given the history between our two countries, given the war, that you have a U.S. President received as he's been by both the government and people of Vietnam on this trip.\nThis is different from many other countries around the world when you look at the history. And the fact that we are able to be where we are today with Vietnam in terms of our commercial ties, our security ties, our people-to-people ties, I think it's a testament to the fact that countries get more out of pursuing peaceful cooperation than they do out of conflict.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Let's take one more. Kevin.\nQ: Thanks. I appreciate that, Eric. Ben, I probably speak for a lot of people in the room who are looking for you to sort of unpack some of the comments that you made in that Times Magazine article, in particular when you said \"The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only experience consists of being on the political campaigns. It's a sea change. They literally know nothing.\" And I'm sure that struck a lot of people as a curious statement by you.\nAnd if I could follow, you've been accused of misleading the timeline as far as the negotiations were concerned on the Iran nuclear deal. It was also suggested that you were promoting a narrative that the administration was dealing with moderates when in fact, it was all along dealing with hardliners. If you could clarify that, I'd appreciate it. I know you've discussed this at least in part, but I don't think I've had a chance to engage you personally or have you comment on these things on camera.\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, on the second question, many of you saw the Medium post I wrote after the article came out. I mean, you all covered the Iran deal for many years. At no point did I say in that article that there was any false narrative as it relates to the Iranian hardliners and moderates.\nI think if we review the facts, they're very clear. We had wanted to pursue an Iranian nuclear deal for a very long time. President Obama campaigned on that platform. I went to work for him in the summer of 2007, when he was having a debate in the Democratic primary about whether to pursue diplomacy with Iran. So that was no secret.\nThe fact of the matter is we pursued several efforts to make progress on nuclear negotiations in the first term, some of them quite public, and they did not go anywhere. It is also true that we were able to establish that we could have a discreet channel of communication with the Iranians through Oman during the President's first term. However, those discussions did not go anywhere. They were not substantive. They did not in any way foresee the deal that was ultimately reached. All it was, was our ability to establish that we could have a discussion with the Iranians, which we were already having in other forums, like the P5+1.\nSo this was dead in the water in our first term. And that's precisely why we spent so much time imposing sanctions on Iran, because we did not see a change in the position of the Iranian government.\nIt is also undeniably true that that changed after the election of Hassan Rouhani. And what happened after President Rouhani was elected is that President Obama wrote him a letter and indicated that we wanted to pursue a dialogue on nuclear issues. Very quickly, that led to the negotiations that began in secret between the United States and Iran in the summer leading to the fall of 2013, and then very quickly moved into the P5+1 negotiations that were launched at the U.N. General Assembly in New York in 2013.\nSo there may be a debate that is I think a very important debate about the degree of moderation of different elements of the Iranian leadership -- the difference between a Qasem Soleimani or President Rouhani, for instance, in their respective views of Iranian foreign policy. Some people may not want to apply the term \"moderate\" to anybody in Iran, given their continued violation of international norms and support for terrorism. But the fact of the matter is, President Rouhani, Foreign Minister Zarif approached the nuclear issue in a different way, in a way that was more moderate than the previous regime under President Ahmadinejad. And we were able to get a nuclear deal because there was a different regime and different administration in Tehran.\nSo with respect to the timeline, we have always been absolutely clear about the timeline of our interest in an Iranian nuclear deal and how it unfolded. And, frankly, the areas of that timeline that remained secret for some time have long ago since been publicly discussed, including our talks in Oman.\nSo I do think that it's very important -- I know, while there's debate on the Iranian issue as it relates to the article, that it's clear that what we've said at podiums like this for years is what I would say to any of you, which is that there was a sea change after the election of President Rouhani. That doesn't mean that we agree with everything that he does. There continue to be ballistic missile launches. There continues to be support for terrorism. There continues to be threats to Israel.\nBut on the specific question of the nuclear deal, we did have an administration under President Rouhani that was different from the administration of President Ahmadinejad. And I think that there's just -- anybody who's covered this issue and looked at it closely would find that to be the case, irrespective of other views of Iranian actions or U.S. policy.\nOn the first question, all I'd say is, look, I've been doing this job for over seven years. I've been working with some of you for that entire time or part of that time. I think that you all know how much I take seriously our responsibility to engage with you and to try to communicate our policies on very complicated and difficult issues.\nSo I don't want to take bits of quotes that were pulled out of different places and get into a media commentary here. I addressed this the other day and I'll say something similar here today, which is simply that I think those of you who have worked with me know how much I respect the role of the media in what we do, how much, even if I might disagree with you, I want you to understand where we're coming from and what we're trying to accomplish, and, frankly, how much I enjoy being on trips just like this and talking about issues like this remarkable transformation in our relationship with Vietnam.\nSo, again, I just think that the people who know me and have worked with me know exactly how I approach these issues, how I think about my responsibilities and my engagement with you. It's something that I really have enjoyed for the last seven and a half years and will enjoy doing for the next several months.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you.\nQ: So did you or did you not say that --\nMR. RHODES: Again, I'm not going to parse quotes. Again, I'm telling you I think I have a body of experience that you all are familiar with, and you can make your judgments based on that body of experience.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you.\nEND 8:13 P.M.

The Administration strongly supports home rule for the District and the President has long called for authority allowing the District to spend its own local taxes and other non-Federal funds without congressional approval.\nThe Administration is disappointed that the Congress has failed to provide elected leaders in the Nation's capital the most basic authority to spend local tax collections without congressional approval, an authority held by local officials across the Nation. Subjecting the District to the lengthy and uncertain congressional appropriations process for its use of local tax collections imposes both operational and financial hardships on the District, burdens not borne by any other local government in the country. The residents of the District and their elected leaders deserve to have the same ability as other U.S. residents and elected leaders to determine how to use their local revenues to address their unique needs. Such authority is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy, and the Congress denying the District this authority is an affront to the residents and elected leaders of the District.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5233, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-05-24", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5233 – Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule Act of 2016"}

U.S.-Vietnam goods trade totaled $451 million in 1995, the year the United States and Vietnam normalized diplomatic relations, and since then has increased nearly a hundredfold to $45 billion.\nOur relationship is fast-growing: In 2015, U.S. exports to Vietnam grew by 23 percent, the largest year-on-year increase of exports to any of America's top 50 export markets. Over the period 2010 to 2015, Vietnam was the second fastest growing of America's top 50 export markets.\nOur relationship is diversifying: U.S. export growth is high in sectors ranging from integrated circuits to civil aircraft, and cotton, dairy, tree/fruit nuts, and other agricultural products. In the last five years Vietnam has developed an important role as a supplier of high-tech consumer products to the United States.\nOur relationship is inclusive: Trade included small and family businesses in both countries as well as large firms. As of 2014, 6,031 small- and medium-sized American firms exported to Vietnam while 5,895 small- and medium-sized U.S. businesses imported Vietnamese goods.\nWe are now taking the next step. In addition to witnessing over $16 billion in deal signings to advance aviation and energy sector development in Vietnam and support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs, President Obama's visit highlights our commitment in the following areas:\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)\nTPP is central to our goal of deepening the U.S.-Vietnamese economic relationship. The Administration has made securing ratification of TPP a top priority and is working with Vietnam and other TPP partners to help them ensure timely and complete implementation of their TPP commitments. TPP will create new opportunities for American and Vietnamese workers and businesses, including small businesses; promote innovation and the digital economy; foster fair competition, transparency, and good governance; and promote workers' rights, conservation, and sustainable growth. It also is a critical step toward our strategic goal of revitalizing the open, rules-based economic system that the United States has led since World War II.\nThe U.S. government will commit resources and technical expertise to support Vietnam and our other TPP partners to implement and effectively enforce the obligations of the agreement. To support Vietnam, the United States is providing more than $30 million in capacity building assistance, which will include work to ensure freedom of association, including independent unions, and other internationally recognized labor rights; protection and enforcement of intellectual property; and environmental protection and sustainable growth.\nU.S. Corporate Social Responsibility\nU.S. foreign direct investment in Vietnam grew to $1.5 billion in 2014 and has been complemented by U.S. corporate citizenship investments in Vietnam's communities and environment. U.S. firms in Vietnam uphold high standards of corporate citizenship by investing in the communities and environment in which they do business. For example, U.S. companies in Vietnam have trained hundreds of engineers on environmental protection and sustainable development, donated over $12 million in software and services to support hundreds of non-governmental organizations, and enhanced the skillset of tens of thousands of teachers and students in the use of information and communication technology. The U.S. government is committed to supporting public-private partnerships that encourage corporate social responsibility by U.S. firms:\nA USAID partnership with Arizona State University and several U.S. companies is enabling university-private sector collaboration, and developing curriculum partnerships, mentorships, and industry-sponsored practical opportunities.\nNumerous U.S. companies are collaborating on a new USAID alliance with Harvard Medical School and two Boston-area hospitals to improve the quality and effectiveness of medical education in Vietnam, including in areas relevant to the Global Health Security Agenda.\nIn 2016, Cargill Vietnam won the U.S. Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence for its long-term commitment to investing in its farmer-partners, supporting community health, and training over 12,000 farmers in sustainable production techniques. Cargill Vietnam's Cargill Cares school building program has built and delivered 76 schools across rural communities, benefiting more than 13,000 children per year.\nA Whole-of-Government Approach to Partnership\nThe United States employs a whole-of-government approach to support U.S. exports to and investment in Vietnam, including programs that promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, encourage legitimate and accountable governance while addressing trade barriers, support corporate social responsibility, and strengthen the rule of law and business climate.\nU.S.-ASEAN Connect Initiative\nThrough U.S.-ASEAN Connect, the U.S. government will work with Vietnam and other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to foster the policy environments that promote ASEAN economic integration, increase trade and investment, assist the development of clean energy and energy connectivity, and spur sustainable, innovation-led economic growth.\nU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\nUSAID's economic growth and governance programs will support Vietnam's efforts to promote greater transparency and accountability, economic openness, competition, and the rule of law in economic affairs. USAID has contributed to over 150 laws and related regulations and decrees, and assisted more than 50 Vietnamese government agency counterparts in the legal and economic reform process.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nVietnam now ranks as the United States' 11th-largest agricultural export market. To burgeon this relationship, USDA will assist Vietnam's capacity building on a wide range of areas, including: food safety, climate-smart agriculture, biotechnology, animal health, plant health, modern retail/distribution, and other sector-specific topics.\nU.S. Department of Commerce\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce will work alongside the U.S. private sector to assist Vietnam in developing the strong infrastructure the country requires to meet its goals of economic modernization by 2035. The Department commits to arranging annual private sector meetings with the appropriate ministries, in addition to continuing its infrastructure-focused conferences in areas such as healthcare, aviation, smart cities, and clean energy.\nThe Department plans on leading a Water Infrastructure Business Development Mission to Vietnam in July 2016, to introduce new technologies and internationally recognized codes and standards to strengthen Vietnam's water sector. The Department also plans to organize a Civil Nuclear Trade Mission in 2017, supporting U.S.-Vietnamese industry cooperation in the development of Vietnam's civil nuclear program.\nU.S. Department of State\nThe U.S. Department of State has contributed to Vietnam's development of a science-based regulatory system to address trade and food security issues including on agricultural biotechnology through activities that have reached hundreds of Vietnamese policymakers, scientists, academics, and journalists.\nU.S. Department of the Treasury\nTo build a more transparent and accountable financial reporting infrastructure, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) will continue to provide Vietnam's Ministry of Finance technical assistance toward the creation of country-wide training programs on International Public Sector Accounting Standards; accounting resources and tools, including financial statement reports and templates; and user guide manuals that will document the Whole-of-Government consolidated financial statement preparation process.\nU.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank)\nSince 2009, EXIM Bank has authorized over $800 million in loans, guarantees and insurance to support U.S. exports - from businesses large and small - to Vietnam. These exports have supported U.S.-Vietnam economic engagement across multiple sectors including renewable energy, aviation, and manufacturing. These U.S. exports not only support thousands of jobs in the United States, but also create jobs and boost infrastructure investment in Vietnam.\nEXIM will remain actively engaged on future opportunities to finance U.S. exports to Vietnam, particularly those that also support Vietnam's infrastructure development needs. EXIM Bank reaffirms its interest in supporting U.S. exports for civil nuclear power projects in Vietnam.\nU.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)\nUSTDA will continue to connect U.S. businesses to priority projects in Vietnam's clean energy, information technology, transportation, and water sectors. By building mutually beneficial partnerships that leverage capital for Vietnam's infrastructure development, the Agency will expand upon the $3 billion in U.S. exports that it has already helped facilitate to Vietnam.\nUSTDA is committed to helping strengthen Vietnam's aviation safety oversight. In the energy sector the Agency is facilitating the development of 470 megawatts of wind power generation, which could leverage over $1 billion in investment. In urban transportation, USTDA is supporting a $100 million information and communication technology deployment for the Ho Chi Minh City metro rail system.\nTo support Vietnam's shift from coal-fired power generation, USTDA will sponsor a natural gas reverse trade mission to the United States in fall 2016. The visit will highlight the United States' experience in the construction, operation, maintenance, and refurbishment of gas-fired power plants and related infrastructure.\nThrough its Global Procurement Initiative: Understanding Best Value (GPI), USTDA will partner with the Ministry of Planning and Investment to design a database to track and monitor the performance of contractors who provide billions of dollars in goods and services to the Government of Vietnam each year.\nOverseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)\nAs the U.S. government's development finance institution, OPIC will leverage its newly opened office in Southeast Asia to unlock opportunities that support Vietnam's economic development through private sector investment in all sectors, with particular attention to renewable energy and aviation infrastructure.\nSince 2003, OPIC has provided more than $40 million in financing and insurance support to seven projects in Vietnam. OPIC's investments have cut across sectors, including communications, manufacturing, consulting and economic development services, aquaculture, and power generation.", "timestamp": "2016-05-24", "title": "Fact Sheet: Trade and Investment with Vietnam"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118147", "text": "The United States and Vietnam intend to deepen our clean energy cooperation in the civil nuclear field in recognition that the safe and secure use of nuclear power is an important low-carbon energy source for reducing emissions from the global power sector as we address climate change and for providing energy security to a greater number of people. At the center of this relationship is our shared commitment to the highest levels of nuclear safety, security, and nonproliferation, as well as the sustainment of strong, independent and effective regulatory bodies. Earlier this month, the United States and Vietnam signed the Administrative Arrangement under our historic agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy (123 Agreement), which initially opened the door to nuclear trade between our two countries in 2014. To further build on this robust cooperation in the civil nuclear field, the United States and Vietnam aim to:\nBuild Institutional Connections:\n• Establish a new U.S.-Vietnam Joint Committee on Civil Nuclear Cooperation to facilitate the implementation of the 123 Agreement as well as cooperation and information sharing, including engagement from both the government and private sectors, in a range of areas including nuclear safety, security, safeguards and nonproliferation.\n• Work towards the establishment of a Technical Support Center for Nuclear Security and Safeguards in Vietnam. Through human resource development and technical and scientific support in nuclear security, the Center would contribute to strengthening nuclear security in Vietnam and throughout the region.\n• Support efforts by Vietnam to ratify the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) and the International Convention on the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\nEnhance Training and Education:\n• Increase academic and professional exchange opportunities in civil nuclear energy, safety and security through United States educational programs, such as the Fulbright Specialist Program, the International Visitor Leadership Program on Demand, and scholarships to support Vietnamese nuclear science and engineering students and professionals.\n• Strengthen Vietnam's safeguards capacity through training on Vietnam's information management system for safeguards, establishing a national safeguards inspections program, and development of a strategic plan for a safeguards laboratory.\n• Provide capacity building activities at Idaho National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory to train researchers from Vietnamese institutions in: fuels and materials for a new research reactor; nuclear power plant simulator and human reliability; and safety analysis and design-basis accidents and severe accidents in a nuclear power plant. This training would start in the 4th Quarter of 2016.\n• Complement Vietnamese university nuclear curriculum programs with the Department of Energy supported remote reactor training from North Carolina State University.\n• Facilitate information sharing and school contacts through the Nuclear Uniform Curriculum program, which consists of 32 U.S.-based community colleges that offer two-year nuclear technology degrees for future nuclear plant operators.\nPromote Effective Regulators:\n• Build nuclear regulatory capacity in Vietnam to meet international standards through the exchange of regulatory experience and nuclear safety training with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These activities are designed to assist Vietnam in the development of its regulatory infrastructure and to maintain the core technical competencies to help prepare Vietnam's regulator to license and construct new reactors.\n• Support nuclear security regulatory development and associated training in Vietnam through cooperation between the Vietnam Agency for Radiation and Nuclear Safety (VARANS) and U.S. Government agencies.\nStrengthen Export Controls:\n• Develop Vietnam's capacity to regulate trade and transfer dual-use goods, equipment, and technologies, and establish related border enforcement measures through the U.S. Export Control and Related Border Security Program. These activities are designed to improve Vietnam's strategic trade control legal framework and meet international standards.\n• Build capacity within Vietnam Customs to recognize nuclear, missile, chemical, and biological dual-use commodities controlled by the multilateral export control regimes. Through training and workshops, assist Vietnam to establish a strategic trade control system to promote nonproliferation and economic development.\nSecure and Track Nuclear and Radiological Materials:\n• Partner with a diverse group of Vietnamese government stakeholders to build sustainable capacity focused on securing nuclear and radiological material and deter, detect, and interdict the trafficking of those materials. This is accomplished through workshops, training, exchange of best practices, security upgrades at sites with high-activity radiological material, and the installation of radiation detection systems at key ports.\n• Support the development of Vietnam's new system to automatically track and report the transfer of nuclear and radiological material in accordance with IAEA standards, including through provision of software and hardware components, advice, guidance, and quality checks.\n• Support the VARANS Nuclear Security Program through a series of four nuclear security training workshops by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency in cooperation with other U.S. Government agencies.\nStrengthen Incident Response Capabilities:\n• Enhance Vietnam's nuclear incident preparedness and response through training courses on detecting and responding to radiological/nuclear emergencies, consequence management, and medical response; operational training for major public events; provision of access to U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration emergency response reach-back and technical capabilities; and potentially provision of emergency response technical equipment to Vietnam.\nPublic-Private Educational Support:\n• Promote joint U.S. Government - U.S. Industry training for Vietnamese officials in nuclear science and engineering and other related programs.\nPromote Bilateral Civil Nuclear Trade\n• Organize a Civil Nuclear Trade Mission in 2017, supporting U.S.-Vietnamese industry cooperation in the development of Vietnam's civil nuclear program.", "timestamp": "2016-05-24", "title": "Fact Sheet: Enhancing U.S.-Vietnam Civil Nuclear Clean Energy Cooperation"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118150", "text": "The World Humanitarian Summit is a high-level event convened to reinvigorate international commitments to humanitarian principles and strengthen the international community's response to crises caused by conflicts and natural disasters. Conflict-related crises and natural disasters affect approximately 125 million people on an annual basis - a combined population equivalent to the world's 12th largest nation. Conflict and human rights abuses have forced approximately 60 million persons worldwide to flee their homes. Natural disasters have displaced an average of 26 million persons annually in recent years. These humanitarian crises have caused a staggering loss of life and destructive economic and social impacts that have reversed decades of hard-earned development progress in some locations.\nThe World Humanitarian Summit occurs at an historic moment when the scale of displaced populations in need of humanitarian assistance and protection has reached levels unseen since World War II. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon convened the first World Humanitarian Summit to bring together more than 5,000 government, private sector, and civil society representatives in unity to draw attention to the issues of today. Gayle Smith, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) led the U.S. delegation to the summit in Istanbul, which included representatives from the White House, Department of State, including the United States Mission to the United Nations, the Department of Defense, and USAID.\nAs the world's single largest humanitarian assistance donor with contributions of nearly $26 billion in the past 5 fiscal years, the United States views the World Humanitarian Summit as an important opportunity to promote a stronger and more accountable international system capable of addressing today's unprecedented needs. The Summit is also an important opportunity to emphasize that support and financing from a broad set of traditional donors as well as from new sources are essential to address emergencies effectively. President Obama's Leaders' Summit on Refugees in September 2016 will be a timely complement to the World Humanitarian Summit and will further efforts to address the needs of refugees, host communities and other affected populations.\nThe United States' primary objectives for the World Humanitarian Summit are to:\n• Reduce the impact of conflict on civilians, with special attention to the impact on women and girls, and re-affirm our country's longstanding commitment to international humanitarian law;\n• Strengthen the international humanitarian system, including how it is resourced, and its effectiveness in addressing needs;\n• Improve coherence between humanitarian and development assistance to better address recurring and protracted crises.\nUnited States' Response to Humanitarian Emergencies\nThe United States is committed to helping people around the world during this time of unprecedented need. In 2015, the U.S. government provided more than $6 billion in humanitarian assistance to more than 60 new and protracted emergencies worldwide ranging from earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods to health epidemics, conflicts, and refugee influxes, with the vast majority of our assistance meeting needs in long running conflicts. When the scope of a disaster overwhelms the capacity of an affected country to respond, the United States is able to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) overseas to conduct disaster assessments, determine urgent needs, and coordinate response activities with affected governments and implementing partners. The U.S. government had a record five DARTs deployed simultaneously during 2015 to support large-scale relief efforts in West Africa[1], South Sudan, Syria, Iraq, and Nepal. In addition, the U.S. government has more than 120 refugee coordinators and emergency humanitarian response specialists stationed around the world to advise and coordinate the U.S. government's humanitarian response.\nReducing the Effect of Conflict on Civilians\nUpholding humanity is at the core of humanitarian action and the United Nations Charter reaffirms faith in the dignity and worth of the human person. Protecting the vulnerable from harm and preserving their dignity, in particular by upholding international law and seeking accountability for violations, should be at the very top of the international community's agenda. The United States joins with 47 other countries in presenting a statement to reinforce commitment to the protection of civilians in conflict situations by honoring the full spirit and letter of international law and to reaffirm and strengthen international respect for the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence that should serve as the foundation for all humanitarian response.\nThe international community should have more systematic approaches to address the scope and nature of constraints placed on agencies delivering humanitarian relief in order to identify systematic access denials, devise appropriate policy measures through multilateral fora, and take other appropriate action. We intend to work with other Member States, the UN, and humanitarian organizations in the coming months to identify concrete ways to address more systematically challenges to humanitarian access to populations in need.\nThe United States believes that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, which includes addressing gender-based violence (GBV), is a critical priority and will continue to advance the Call to Action for women and girls in emergencies, which is a global effort to fundamentally change humanitarian response to GBV. This includes a pledge of an additional $12.5 million in 2016 in support of Safe from the Start, a joint Department of State-USAID initiative to better protect women and girls in crisis, bringing the U.S. total contribution to more than $50 million since 2013.\nStrengthening International Humanitarian Assistance Operations\nThe United States is working to strengthen how the international humanitarian system operates, including how it is resourced. In response to human suffering caused by conflict and disasters, many emergency relief agencies do outstanding work that saves countless lives. Despite increased global funding for emergency programs and an impressive expansion of services in recent years the international community has been unable to keep pace with the increased emergency needs worldwide.\nAt the Summit, the United States emphasized the importance of ensuring that emergency assistance is provided effectively and efficiently to meet the needs of crisis-affected people. The U.S. government calls on humanitarian organizations to work together better to assess needs among affected populations, identify gaps in existing relief programs, and formulate collective response strategies that identify clear priorities according to urgency of need and inclusive of all affected populations, including refugees. As a result of political commitments at the Summit, humanitarian agencies should be able and willing to strengthen their operational coordination to minimize service gaps and avoid duplication of programs. UN humanitarian agencies should take steps to ensure that leadership of humanitarian operations is effective and accountable.\nThe United States commits to providing flexible funding to enable humanitarian agencies to more easily adjust emergency programs to address shifting needs and longer time horizons where humanitarian agencies demonstrate increased accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The United States is also committed to continuing its legacy of building local capacity so that humanitarian response can be as local as possible and as international as needed. The United States is joining with other donor governments and humanitarian agencies in what is being called a \"Grand Bargain\" that will strengthen how humanitarian assistance efforts are designed, funded, implemented, and evaluated so as to maximize their impact and efficiency and increase their accountability to affected populations.\nFostering Humanitarian and Development Coherence\nThe United States is redoubling efforts to strengthen coherence between our humanitarian and development assistance efforts. The destruction caused by conflicts and natural disasters has eroded and in some cases reversed the hard-earned progress many communities had made toward long-term, sustainable development. The frequency of extreme weather events is increasing as a result of climate change, and too often refugees and internally displaced persons become trapped in protracted displacement and dependency for years or decades. Their needs are closely related to the development needs of communities that host them. The international community responds to emergencies to save lives, but it must also do a better job of ensuring that the people saved will have an opportunity to enjoy a productive future.\nTo help bridge this gap, the U.S. government is providing leadership and technical assistance to support global efforts to prioritize and strengthen education in emergencies and protracted crises, and will provide a $20 million contribution to \"Education Cannot Wait: a Fund for Education in Emergencies\" for one year, and looks forward to learning from its progress. The UNICEF-managed Fund will help transform the global education sector and bridge the humanitarian and development divide through a more collaborative, agile, and rapid response to education in emergencies. Ultimately, the Fund will increase safe and quality education so that all children have the opportunity to learn even amid protracted emergency situations.\nThe U.S. government also supports greater World Bank engagement in protracted and recurrent crises and its intent to establish a Global Crisis Response Platform. Initially, the Platform should provide support to developing countries, irrespective of region or income level, that are hosting large numbers of refugees on a protracted basis, to enable these countries to invest more in livelihoods and education opportunities for affected populations, and alleviate strains on national infrastructure and social services.\nAdditionally, the United States will initiate a Crisis Review Mechanism within the U.S. government that will review a crisis to determine whether and how our relief programming should pivot to a combined humanitarian-development approach. And we will continue our work of building resilience in fragile communities so they can more effectively prevent or withstand shocks that trigger large-scale emergencies. The U.S. government is committed to support responsible national governments in reducing their risks of disaster and strengthen their capacity to lead their own response efforts when disasters strike, and will continue to build and support local capacity for disaster risk reduction and humanitarian response.\n[1] Funding figures do not include supplemental resources allocated by Congress for the U.S. government response to Ebola in West Africa.", "timestamp": "2016-05-24", "title": "Fact Sheet: World Humanitarian Summit - U.S. Government Priorities"}

And I just want to thank them for taking the time to meet with me and discussing with me some of the important work that they're doing, and the progress that's being made in—here in Vietnam.\nWe have a wide range of activists here. We have pastors whose congregations are doing important work helping individuals fight addiction and encouraging the faithful around the values of their faith. We have advocates on behalf of the disabled who are doing important work to make sure that they have full access to jobs and opportunity here in Vietnam. We have LGBT activists who are making sure that the marginalized in society have a voice. We have advocates on behalf of freedom of speech and press and the Internet, who are doing important training throughout the country. We have a very popular artist here who is speaking out on behalf of freedom of speech and expression and artists throughout Vietnam.\nAnd so what I've heard consistently from all of them is a recognition that Vietnam has made remarkable strides in many ways—the economy is growing quickly, the Internet is booming, and there's a growing confidence here—but that, as I indicated yesterday, there are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government.\nI emphasized in my meetings yesterday with the President, the Prime Minister, the General Secretary, the Chairwoman of the National Assembly that we respect the sovereignty and independence of Vietnam. Ultimately, it's up to the Vietnamese people to determine how their society functions and the nature of their government.\nBut we do believe in certain universal values, and it's important for us to speak out on behalf of those values wherever we go. And it's particularly important and useful for me to hear directly from those who, under often very difficult conditions, are willing to make their voices heard on behalf of greater freedom and human rights.\nI should note that there were several other activists who were invited who were prevented from coming for various reasons. And I think it's an indication of the fact that, although there has been some modest progress—and it is our hope that through some of the legal reforms that are being drafted and passed there will be more progress—there are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about.\nAnd it's my hope that the Government of Vietnam comes to recognize what we've recognized and what so many countries around the world have recognized, and that is that it's very hard to prosper in this modern economy if you haven't fully unleashed the potential of your people. And your people's potential, in part, derives from their ability to express themselves and express new ideas, to try to right wrongs that are taking place in the society. And so it's my hope that, increasingly, the Vietnamese Government, seeing the enormous strides that the country is making, has more confidence that its people want to work together, but also want to be able to assemble and participate in the society in ways that will be good for everybody in the long run. So, again, I want to thank all of you for your courageous work, and I want you to know that you will continue to have a friend in the United States of America, because we think the work that you're doing is work that's important everywhere, including, by the way, in the United States, where there are all sorts of activists and people who are mobilizing, oftentimes are very critical of me and don't always make my life comfortable, but ultimately, I think it is a better country and I do a better job as President because I'm subject to that accountability.\nThank you so much. I very much appreciate it. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-05-24", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Civil Society Leaders in Hanoi, Vietnam"}

In his remarks, he referred to Buddhist monk and peace activist Thích Nhất Hạnh; and Ngô Bảo Châu, Francis and Rose Yuen Distinguished Service Professor of Mathematics, University of Chicago. APP Note: The White House titled these remarks \"Address to the People of Vietnam\".", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117720", "text": "Xin chào! Xin chào, Vietnam! Thank you. Thank you so much. Please. To the Government and the people of Vietnam, thank you for this very warm welcome and the hospitality that you've shown me on this visit. And thank all of you for being here today. We have Vietnamese from across this great country, including so many young people who represent the dynamism and the talent and the hope of Vietnam.\nOn this visit, my heart has been touched by the kindness for which the Vietnamese people are known. In the many people who have been lining the streets, smiling and waving, I feel the friendship between our peoples. Last night I visited the Old Quarter here in Hanoi and enjoyed some outstanding Vietnamese food. I tried some bún chả, drank some Bia Hà Nội. [Laughter] But I have to say, the busy streets of this city, I've never seen so many motorbikes in my life. [Laughter] So I haven't had to try to cross the street so far, but maybe when I come back and visit, you can tell me how. [Laughter]\nI am not the first American President to come to Vietnam in recent times. But I am the first, like so many of you, who came of age after the war between our countries. When the last U.S. Forces left Vietnam, I was just 13 years old. So my first exposure to Vietnam and the Vietnamese people came when I was growing up in Hawaii, with its proud Vietnamese American community there.\nAt the same time, many people in this country are much younger than me. Like my two daughters, many of you have lived your whole lives knowing only one thing, and that is peace and normalized relations between Vietnam and the United States. So I come here mindful of the past, mindful of our difficult history, but focused on the future: the prosperity, security, and human dignity that we can advance together.\nI also come here with a deep respect for Vietnam's ancient heritage. For millennia, farmers have tended these lands, a history revealed in the Đông Sơn drums. At this bend in the river, Hanoi has endured for more than a thousand years. The world came to treasure Vietnamese silks and paintings, and a great Temple of Literature stands as a testament to your pursuit of knowledge. And yet, over the centuries, your fate was too often dictated by others. Your beloved land was not always your own. But like bamboo, the unbroken spirit of the Vietnamese people was captured by Lý Thường Kiệt: \"The Southern emperor rules the Southern land. Our destiny is writ in Heaven's Book.\"\nSo today we also remember the longer history between Vietnamese and Americans that is too often overlooked. More than 200 years ago, when our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, sought rice for his farm, he looked to the rice of Vietnam, which he said had \"the reputation of being whitest to the eye, best flavored to the taste, and most productive.\" And soon after, American trade ships arrived in your ports seeking commerce.\nDuring the Second World War, Americans came here to support your struggle against occupation. When American pilots were shot down, the Vietnamese people helped rescue them. And on the day that Vietnam declared its independence, crowds took to the streets of this city, and Ho Chi Minh evoked the American Declaration of Independence. He said: \"All people are created equal. The Creator has endowed them with inviolable rights. Among these rights are the right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to pursuit of happiness.\"\nIn another time, the profession of these shared ideals and our common story of throwing off colonialism might have brought us closer together sooner. But instead, cold war rivalries and fears of communism pulled us into conflict. Like other conflicts throughout human history, we learned once more a bitter truth: that war, no matter what our intentions may be, brings suffering and tragedy.\nAt your war memorial not far from here, and with family altars across this country, you remember some 3 million Vietnamese, soldiers and civilians, on both sides, who lost their lives. At our memorial wall in Washington, we can touch the names of 58,315 Americans who gave their lives in the conflict. In both our countries, our veterans and families of the fallen still ache for the friends and loved ones that they lost. Just as we learned in America that, even if we disagree about a war, we must always honor those who serve and welcome them home with the respect they deserve. We can join together today, Vietnamese and Americans, and acknowledge the pain and the sacrifices on both sides.\nMore recently, over the past two decades, Vietnam has achieved enormous progress, and today, the world can see the strides that you have made. With economic reforms and trade agreements, including with the United States, you have entered the global economy, selling your goods around the world. More foreign investment is coming in. And with one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, Vietnam has moved up to become a middle-income nation.\nWe see Vietnam's progress in the skyscrapers and high rises of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, new shopping malls, and urban centers. We see it in the satellites Vietnam puts into space and a new generation that is online, launching startups and running new ventures. We see it in the tens of millions of Vietnamese connected on Facebook and Instagram. And you're not just posting selfies, although I hear you do that a lot. [Laughter] And so far, there have been a number of people who have already asked me for selfies. [Laughter] You're also raising your voices for causes that you care about, like saving the old trees of Hanoi.\nSo all this dynamism has delivered real progress in people's lives. Here in Vietnam, you've dramatically reduced extreme poverty, you've boosted family incomes and lifted millions into a fast-growing middle class. Hunger, disease, child and maternal mortality are all down. The number of people with clean drinking water and electricity, the number of boys and girls in school, and your literacy rate—these are all up. So this is extraordinary progress. This is what you have been able to achieve in a very short time.\nAnd as Vietnam has transformed, so has the relationship between our two nations. We learned a lesson taught by the venerable Thích Nhất Hạnh, who said, \"In true dialogue, both sides are willing to change.\" In this way, the very war that had divided us became a source for healing. It allowed us to account for the missing and finally bring them home. It allowed us to help remove landmines and unexploded bombs, because no child should ever lose a leg just playing outside. Even as we continue to assist Vietnamese with disabilities, including children, we are also continuing to help remove agent orange—dioxins—so that Vietnam can reclaim more of your land. We're proud of our work together in Danang, and we look forward to supporting your efforts in Bien Hoa.\nLet's also not forget that the reconciliation between our countries was led by our veterans who once faced each other in battle. Think of Senator John McCain, who was held for years here as a prisoner of war, meeting General Giáp, who said our countries should not be enemies, but friends. Think of all the veterans, Vietnamese and American, who have helped us heal and build new ties. Few have done more in this regard over the years than a former Navy lieutenant, and now Secretary of State for the United States, John Kerry, who is here today. And on behalf of all of us, John, we thank you for your extraordinary efforts.\nBecause our veterans showed us the way, because warriors had the courage to pursue peace, our peoples are now closer than ever before. Our trade has surged. Our students and scholars learn together. We welcome more Vietnamese students to America than from any other country in Southeast Asia. And every year, you welcome more and more American tourists, including young Americans with their backpacks, to Hanoi's 36 Streets and the shops of Hội An and the imperial city of Hue. As Vietnamese and Americans, we can all relate to those words written by Van Cao: \"From now, we know each other's homeland; from now, we learn to feel for each other.\"\nAs President, I've built on this progress. With our new comprehensive partnership, our governments are working more closely together than ever before. And with this visit, we've put our relationship on a firmer footing for decades to come. In a sense, the long story between our two nations that began with Thomas Jefferson more than two centuries ago has now come full circle. It's taken many years and required great effort. But now we can say something that was once unimaginable: Today, Vietnam and the United States are partners.\nAnd I believe our experience holds lessons for the world. At a time when many conflicts seem intractable, seem as if they will never end, we have shown that hearts can change and that a different future is possible when we refuse to be prisoners of the past. We've shown how peace can be better than war. We've shown that progress and human dignity is best advanced by cooperation and not conflict. That's what Vietnam and America can show the world.\nNow, America's new partnership with Vietnam is rooted in some basic truths. Vietnam is an independent, sovereign nation, and no other nation can impose its will on you or decide your destiny. Now, the United States has an interest here. We have an interest in Vietnam's success. But our comprehensive partnership is still in its early stages. And with the time I have left, I want to share with you the vision that I believe can guide us in the decades ahead.\nFirst, let's work together to create real opportunity and prosperity for all of our people. We know the ingredients for economic success in the 21st century. In our global economy, investment and trade flows to wherever there is rule of law, because no one wants to pay a bribe to start a business. Nobody wants to sell their goods or go to school if they don't know how they're going to be treated. In knowledge-based economies, jobs go to where people have the freedom to think for themselves and exchange ideas and to innovate. And real economic partnerships are not just about one country extracting resources from another. They're about investing in our greatest resource, which is our people and their skills and their talents, whether you live in a big city or a rural village. And that's the kind of partnership that America offers.\nAs I announced yesterday, the Peace Corps will come to Vietnam for the first time, with a focus on teaching English. And a generation after young Americans came here to fight, a new generation of Americans are going to come here to teach and build and deepen the friendships between us. Some of America's leading technology companies and academic institutions are joining Vietnamese universities to strengthen training in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine. Because even as we keep welcoming more Vietnamese students to America, we also believe that young people deserve a world-class education right here in Vietnam. It's one of the reasons why we're very excited that this fall, the new Fulbright University Vietnam will open in Ho Chi Minh City: this nation's first independent, nonprofit university, where there will be full academic freedom and scholarships for those in need. Students, scholars, researchers will focus on public policy and management and business; on engineering and computer science; and liberal arts, everything from the poetry of Nguyễn Du, to the philosophy of Phan Chu Trinh, to the mathematics of Ngô Bảo Châu.\nAnd we're going to keep partnering with young people and entrepreneurs, because we believe that if you can just access the skills and technology and capital you need, then nothing can stand in your way, and that includes, by the way, the talented women of Vietnam. We think gender equality is an important principle. From Trung Sisters to today, strong, confident women have always helped move Vietnam forward. And the evidence is clear—I say this wherever I go around the world—families, communities, and countries are more prosperous when girls and women have an equal opportunity to succeed in school and at work and in government. That's true everywhere, and it's true here in Vietnam.\nWe'll keep working to unleash the full potential of your economy with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Now, here in Vietnam, TPP will let you sell more of your products to the world, and it will attract new investment. TPP will require reforms to protect workers and rule of law and intellectual property. And the United States is ready to assist Vietnam as it works to fully implement its commitments. I want you to know that, as President of the United States, I strongly support TPP because you'll also be able to buy more of our goods, \"Made in America.\"\nMoreover, I support TPP because of its important strategic benefits. Vietnam will be less dependent on any one trading partner and enjoy broader ties with more partners, including the United States. And TPP will reinforce regional cooperation. It will help address economic inequality and will advance human rights, with higher wages and safer working conditions. For the first time here in Vietnam, the right to form independent labor unions and prohibitions against forced labor and child labor. And it has the strongest environmental protections and the strongest anticorruption standards of any trade agreement in history. That's the future TPP offers for all of us, because all of us—the United States, Vietnam, and the other signatories—will have to abide by these rules that we have shaped together. That's the future that is available to all of us. So we now have to get it done, for the sake of our economic prosperity and our national security.\nThis brings me to the second area where we can work together, and that is ensuring our mutual security. With this visit, we've agreed to elevate our security cooperation and build more trust between our men and women in uniform. We'll continue to offer training and equipment to your Coast Guard to enhance Vietnam's maritime capabilities. We will partner to deliver humanitarian aid in times of disaster. With the announcement I made yesterday to fully lift the ban on defense sales, Vietnam will have greater access to the military equipment you need to ensure your security. And the United States is demonstrating our commitment to fully normalize our relationship with Vietnam.\nMore broadly, the 20th century has taught all of us, including the United States and Vietnam, that the international order upon which our mutual security depends is rooted in certain rules and norms. Nations are sovereign, and no matter how large or small a nation may be, its sovereignty should be respected, and its territory should not be violated. Big nations should not bully smaller ones. Disputes should be resolved peacefully. And regional institutions, like ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, should continue to be strengthened. That's what I believe. That's what the United States believes. And that's the kind of partnership America offers this region. I look forward to advancing this spirit of respect and reconciliation later this year when I become the first U.S. President to visit Laos.\nIn the South China Sea, the United States is not a claimant in current disputes. But we will stand with partners in upholding core principles, like freedom of navigation and overflight and lawful commerce that is not impeded and the peaceful resolution of disputes, through legal means, in accordance with international law. And as we go forward, the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, and we will support the right of all countries to do the same.\nNow, even as we cooperate more closely in the areas I've described, our partnership includes a third element: addressing areas where our governments disagree, including on human rights. I say this not to single out Vietnam. No nation is perfect. Two centuries on, the United States is still striving to live up to our founding ideals. We still deal with our shortcomings: too much money in politics and rising economic inequality, racial bias in our criminal justice system, women still not being paid as much as men doing the same job. We still have problems. And we're not immune from criticism. I promise you, I hear it every day. But that scrutiny, that open debate, confronting our imperfections, and allowing everybody to have their say has helped us grow stronger and more prosperous and more just.\nNow, I've said this before: The United States does not seek to impose our form of a government on Vietnam. The rights I speak of I believe are not American values, I think they're universal values written into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They're written into the Vietnamese Constitution, which states that \"citizens have the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and have the right of access to information, the right to assembly, the right to association, and the right to demonstrate.\" That's in the Vietnamese Constitution. So really, this is an issue about all of us, each country, trying to consistently apply these principles, making sure that we—those of us in government—are being true to these ideals.\nIn recent years, Vietnam has made some progress. Vietnam has committed to bringing its laws in line with its new constitution and with international norms. Under recently passed laws, the Government will disclose more of its budget, and the public will have the right to access more information. And as I said, Vietnam has committed to economic and labor reforms under the TPP. So these are all positive steps. And ultimately, the future of Vietnam will be decided by the people of Vietnam. Every country will chart its own path, and our two nations have different traditions and different political systems and different cultures. But as a friend of Vietnam, allow me to share my view, why I believe nations are more successful when universal rights are upheld.\nWhen there is freedom of expression and freedom of speech and when people can share ideas and access the Internet and social media without restriction, that fuels the innovation economies need to thrive. That's where new ideas happen. That's how a Facebook starts. That's how some of our greatest companies began, because somebody had a new idea that was different. And they were able to share it. When there's freedom of the press—when journalists and bloggers are able to shine a light on injustice or abuse—that holds officials accountable and builds public confidence that the system works. When candidates can run for office and campaign freely and voters can choose their own leaders in free and fair elections, it makes the countries more stable, because citizens know that their voices count and that peaceful change is possible. And it brings new people into the system. When there is freedom of religion, it not only allows people to fully express the love and compassion that are at the heart of all great religions, but it allows faith groups to serve their own communities through schools and hospitals and care for the poor and the vulnerable. And when there is freedom of assembly, and citizens are free to organize in civil society, then countries can better address challenges that government sometimes cannot solve by itself. So it is my view that upholding these rights is not a threat to stability, but actually reinforces stability and is the foundation of progress.\nAfter all, it was a yearning for these very rights that inspired people around the world, including Vietnam, to throw off colonialism. And I believe that upholding these rights is the fullest expression of the independence that so many cherish, including here, in a nation that proclaims itself to be \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\"\nVietnam will do it differently than the United States does. And each of us will do it differently from many other countries around the world. But there are these basic principles that I think we all have to try to work on and improve. And I say this as somebody who's about to leave office, so I have the benefit of almost 8 years now of reflecting on how our system has worked and interacting with countries around the world who are constantly trying to improve their systems as well.\nNow, finally, our partnership, I think, can meet global challenges that no nation can solve by itself. If we're going to ensure the health of our people and the beauty of our planet, then development has to be sustainable. Natural wonders like Halong Bay and Son Doòng Cave have to be preserved for our children and our grandchildren. Rising seas threaten the coasts and waterways on which so many Vietnamese depend. And so as partners in the fight against climate change, we need to fulfill the commitments we made in Paris, and we need to help farmers and villages and people who depend on fishing to adapt and to bring more clean energy to places like the Mekong Delta. This is a rice bowl of the world that we need to feed future generations.\nAnd we can save lives beyond our borders. By helping other countries strengthen, for example, their health systems, we can prevent outbreaks of disease from becoming epidemics that threaten all of us. And as Vietnam deepens its commitment to U.N. peacekeeping, the United States is proud to help train your peacekeepers. And what a truly remarkable thing that is: Our two nations that once fought each other now standing together and helping others achieve peace as well. So in addition to our bilateral relationship, our partnership also allows us to help shape the international environment in ways that are positive.\nNow, fully realizing the vision that I've described today is not going to happen overnight, and it is not inevitable. There may be stumbles and setbacks along the way. There are going to be times where there are misunderstandings. It will take sustained effort and true dialogue, where both sides continue to change. But considering all the history and hurdles that we've already overcome, I stand before you today very optimistic about our future together. And my confidence is rooted, as always, in the friendship and shared aspirations of our peoples.\nI think of all the Americans and Vietnamese who have crossed a wide ocean, some reuniting with families for the first time in decades, and who, like Trịnh Công Sơn said in his song, have joined hands, and opening their hearts and seeing our common humanity in each other.\nI think of all the Vietnamese Americans who have succeeded in every walk of life: doctors, journalists, judges, public servants. One of them, who was born here, wrote me a letter and said, by \"God's grace, I have been able to live the American Dream. . . . I'm very proud to be an American, but also very proud to be Vietnamese.\" And today he's here, back in the country of his birth, because, he said, his \"personal passion\" is \"improving the life of every Vietnamese person.\"\nI think of a new generation of Vietnamese—so many of you, so many of the young people who are here—who are ready to make your mark on the world. And I want to say to all the young people listening: Your talent, your drive, your dreams—in those things, Vietnam has everything it needs to thrive. And your destiny is in your hands. This is your moment. And as you pursue the future that you want, I want you to know that the United States of America will be right there with you as your partner and as your friend.\nAnd many years from now, when even more Vietnamese and Americans are studying with each other, innovating and doing business with each other, standing up for our security and promoting human rights and protecting our planet with each other, I hope you think back to this moment and draw hope from the vision that I've offered today. Or, if I can say it another way—in words that you know well from the Tale of Kieu—\"Please take from me this token of trust, so we can embark upon our 100-year journey together.\"\nCảm on cac ban.

Thank you. Well, it's wonderful to be here in Ho Chi Minh City. Please have a seat.\nI just had the opportunity to visit the Jade Emperor Pagoda. And I think going from a 100-year-old sacred temple to this 21st-century DreamPlex is, I think, a wonderful expression of the evolution that's taken place here in Vietnam, a country that honors its history, but is also boldly racing towards the future.\nAnd that's also the story of this city. This is a city on the move. And we could see as we were traveling in from the airport all the activity that's currently taking place. And I'm not just talking about the traffic—[laughter]—although I do think it might be easier to be on a motorbike than a motorcade. [Laughter]\nBut this city, like its—this country, is full of energy. You can see it in the skyscrapers shooting above the horizon and the shops that are springing up in every corner. You can see it online, where tens of millions of Vietnamese are connecting with each other and with the world. And you can feel it here at DreamPlex, where ideas are becoming a reality. I just had the chance to see some of those ideas in action: young people who are making things happen. I saw a virtual game that can help people recover from nerve injuries, to a machine that lets your smartphone control a laser cutter, although you have to be careful with the laser cutter where you point it. [Laughter]\nBut some of this energy may be due to your famous cà phê trúng. That stuff is strong, I understand. But the real driver of Vietnam's growth, and the engine of Ho Chi Minh City, is the spirit of entrepreneurship, the spirit that brings us here today.\nAnd I see it everywhere I travel all around the world. I meet people—and especially young people, like the three that we're about to meet—who are eager to strike out on their own, start something new, and shape their own destinies. Many want to do more than just create a great new app for a phone. They want to contribute to their communities and help people live better lives.\nAnd that's what entrepreneurship is all about. It's building businesses, making a profit, hopefully. But it's also about creating good jobs and developing new products and devising ways to serve others. Entrepreneurship is also the fuel for prosperity that puts rising economies on the path to success. It's what gives young people like so many of you the chance to channel your energy and your passion into something that is bigger than yourselves. And it allows us to come across countries and cultures to solve some of the world's greatest challenges.\nOf course, being an entrepreneur is not easy. It's not easy in the United States; it's not easy here in Vietnam; it's not easy anyplace in the world. It can be tough to get started. It's hard to access capital. It's hard to get the skills that you need to run a business. You might not always have the mentors and the networks that can help guide you along the way. And it can be especially difficult for women, for others who traditionally are not viewed as being at the center of business life in a country, haven't had all the access to the same opportunities. So we've got to tap all the talent that's out there. Just because you are born poor does not mean you should not be able to start a business. Just because you don't look like the traditional businessman doesn't mean you can't make a great product or deliver a great service.\nAnd that's why DreamPlex is so important. It's not only a home for digital entrepreneurs like you, it's also a place where you can share ideas and work together and build a community that supports each other.\nAnd incubators like this allow Vietnam, alongside its emphasis on entrepreneurship, to see more startups happening in this country than ever before. Recently, in 1 year alone, the funding for startups doubled in this country. And we're seeing major acquisitions, like Fossil Group's takeover Misfit Wearables, a Vietnamese company that makes devices like fitness trackers. We're seeing Vietnamese Americans who are coming here to start new ventures, and that shows the strong bond between the United States and Vietnam.\nAnd the world is taking notice. A leading global venture capital firm called 500 Startups just launched a $10 million fund here in Ho Chi Minh City. Next month at our Global Entrepreneurship Summit—something that I've been hosting now for several years—I'll welcome eight Vietnamese entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley so that they can learn from some of the best entrepreneurs and startups and venture capitalists in the world. And your success sends a message to global investors about this country's incredible potential for innovation. Hopefully, it also encourages other Vietnamese entrepreneurs to chase that new great idea and start that new company, which will continue to fuel a ever-expanding Vietnamese economy.\nI'm here today because the United States is committed to being a partner as you grow. With the Peace Corps coming to Vietnam for the first time, our volunteers are going to help more Vietnamese learn English, the language that so often is used in the global economy. With programs like our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, we're helping give thousands of young people across Vietnam the skills and networks they need to turn their ideas into action. With our U.S.-ASEAN Connect initiative, we're matching American investors with Vietnamese entrepreneurs in areas like clean energy. With the women's entrepreneurship center we're going to open here in Vietnam—WECREATE is what we're going to call it—we'll help empower the next generation of women business owners.\nAnd if we really want to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, I should mention that we need to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because TPP will not only let us sell more of our goods to each other and bring our economies closer together, it will accelerate economic reforms here in Vietnam, boost your economic competitiveness, open up new markets not only for large companies, but also for small and medium-sized businesses. It will raise labor and environmental standards, and it will improve business conditions so that entrepreneurs like you can thrive.\nSo my message to all the entrepreneurs here today is that I believe in you, America believes in you, and we're going to keep investing in your success. Ultimately, it's the inventors and dreamers, people like those that I just met, those that we'll about—we'll hear from soon, and all of you in the audience who are going to shape Vietnam's future for decades to come.\nSo I'm looking forward to hearing from these outstanding young leaders. Thank you very much. Cám ơn.\nEntrepreneurship So I'm just going to introduce very quickly these outstanding young businesspeople who are leading the way here in Vietnam. We invited them here to give us some of their thoughts about what would make it easier for them to start their businesses and to continue to nurture the startups that they're involved with.\nThe first is Khoa Pham, who is the director of legal and corporate at Microsoft Vietnam. We have Lê Hoàng Uyên Vy, who is the founder of Adayroi, which is aiming to become the Amazon of Vietnam. And we have Đỗ Thị Thúy Hằng, who's the vice president of Seedcom, which invests in Vietnamese companies. So please give them a big round of applause, and we'll start our conversation.\nSo, Vy, let's start with you. And tell us—it sounds like you started being interested in business at a very young age.\nAdayroi Founder Lê Hoàng Uyên Vy. Good evening, Mr. President. And good evening, everyone. First of all, I'd like to say thank you to the Vietnamese and U.S. governments for organizing such a wonderful event. My name is Vy, and I graduated from Georgetown University in 2009, majoring in finance. Actually, I have a passion for technology since I was in school. When I was 13, I decided to start my own web design company. And I love the idea of connecting buyers and sellers through an online platform, just like eBay or Amazon.\nBut at the moment, I was so young, and I couldn't start a formal business. So therefore, after my college graduation, I decided to come back to Vietnam and started chon.vn. It's an e-marketplace selling fashion items. And luckily, after 5 years, we became one of the top destination for fashion lovers in Vietnam. And we got acquired by the biggest conglomerate in Vietnam, called Vingroup. And right now I'm running adayroi.com. Basically, we're the Amazon of Vietnam. We sell everything from electronics to even groceries online. And our goal is to bring the safe and high-quality products at affordable price to every family in Vietnam.\nThe President. That's great. The—now, you look very good. Is this some of your fashion that you can sell online? [Laughter] Is that like you can buy the necklace and the earrings?\nMs. Vy. Yes, available on adayroi.com. [Laughter]\nWomen Entrepreneurs\nThe President. Okay. So I just wanted to—so if you're looking for a good deal—[laughter]\nMs. Vy. Thank you.\nThe President. Excellent.\nThe—and, Hằng, you started out as an investor—or as an entrepreneur. Now you're an investor as well. Tell us what have been the challenges that you've met. And have there been some special challenges about being a woman entrepreneur and investor here in Vietnam?\nSeedcom Vice President Đỗ Thị Thúy Hằng. Thank you, Mr. President. It's my honor to be here as well. And I guess let's take it back a little bit. I came back to Vietnam 5 years ago after 9 years in the States. So America is truly my second home. And when I came back, it was basically because of my very close ties with Vietnam. My family has been here; my hometown is here; I love the people here. Because the environment has been very supporting; I've learned a lot from previous generations. And certainly, because I have seen successful role models here, and that's why I came back. I never thought that being a female entrepreneur would be a disadvantage here in the local market, because from my experience and observations around the area, I'm very proud to say that in Vietnam women are treated equally and given a lot of opportunities. So whether we try or not is—starts within ourselves. And we see a lot of women entrepreneurs in the room as well. Chang from Misfit, that you just mentioned, she's incredible. Rena, she's not an entrepreneur, per se, but she has done a terrific job here in Ho Chi Minh City. We all love her. [Laughter]\nSo if the world is run by women—and I'm hinting at the United States election this year—it would be a better place. Like you always say. You always say that.\nThe President. I do. [Laughter] So the—what kind of businesses are you looking to invest in at this point?\nMs. Hằng. So Vietnam is among the top exporters of agricultural products in the world. Yet there are a lot of untapped opportunities in agriculture. And it is still a very low-tech, low-productivity sector. And at Seedcom, we've worked with a lot of companies across retail, technology, and logistics. But the project that we're most excited about at the moment is in agriculture, Cau Dat Farm. We apply technology to traditional farming, very simple stuff like from tracking to automation. And basically, we bring the products all the way to end users at a higher value.\nSo that signals, I guess, the next wave in innovation in Vietnam, where entrepreneurs and investors come together, using technology to tackle very traditional problems in traditional industries. And we are really, super excited about it.\nMicrosoft Corporation/Vietnam-U.S. Business Cooperation\nThe President. Excellent. So the—Khoa, you were born here, moved to the States when you were 11. Is that right?\nMicrosoft Vietnam Director of Corporate, External and Legal Affairs Khoa Pham. That's right.\nThe President. And got your education there, worked in Washington, ended up at a very—an impressive startup called Microsoft—[laughter]—and so now are here representing Microsoft in Ho Chi Minh City. Tell us about, what are the opportunities that Microsoft is seeing, and how you think U.S. companies can most effectively interact with Vietnamese businesspeople and startups and entrepreneurs.\nMr. Pham. Well, welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President. I know it's early morning in Washington, DC——\nThe President. I've gotten over the jetlag.\nMr. Pham. So I'm glad you're awake.\nThe President. I'm fine. [Laughter]\nMr. Pham. So I returned to Vietnam for the same reason that my parents had when they took me out of Vietnam as a young boy, and that is that they wanted me to have an opportunity for a better life. And we found that in the U.S. And after 35 years living in the U.S., I decided to return to Vietnam to give the same opportunity and to make a difference to the young people of Vietnam. Many of them are sitting here today. And so the way I look at my return is that Microsoft gives me the opportunity to make a difference, to improve lives for people through the use of technology, as well as to accelerate the development of the country through technology by the improvement of their ICT infrastructure. So I see a lot of impressive, young entrepreneurs and the spirits of entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. And that's the reason I returned to Vietnam.\nDigital Commerce\nThe President. Good. So, Vy, you were mentioning how you want to be the Amazon of Vietnam. Tell me about the challenges you have in trying to build a digital platform for commerce here in Vietnam and what makes it different trying to develop that here than it might be in the United States, where, obviously, there's more digital platforms and penetration. I'm assuming that, particularly if you want to reach rural areas, that some of the logistical challenges are different. So tell us what has been some of the hardest aspects of building on your vision and how do you think both the Vietnamese Government or the U.S. Government or companies that are interested in working with you or other entrepreneurs, how they can be most helpful. Where do you see the biggest roadblocks?\nMs. Vy. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm very fascinated about building—bringing convenience and modern lifestyle to Vietnamese people. So imagine that working moms has a job from 6 to 9—to 9 to 6, and then after 6 p.m., she has to rush to the supermarket to shop for her home dinner, it would probably take her an hour to get home and then ready to cook for the family.\nThe President. Because the traffic is——\nMs. Vy: Right, the traffic jam. [Laughter] So basically, imagine that one day she can sit in her office and order all the ingredients, and when she gets home, the ingredients will be ready for her to cook dinner for her family. So every day, we can save her an hour to spend more time with her family. Imagine that we can save her 360 hours per year, which translates to 7,300 hours over 20 years, which is equivalent to almost a year. So we can save a woman a year over 20 years. So that's our dream.\nThe President. Right.\nMs. Vy. But basically, it's very challenging because even online grocery in America is difficult because of the infrastructure. It's very, very difficult for us to get the items to the customer on time, and especially, we have a commitment to deliver it within 2 hours, which is quite impossible when we first started. But then, we are very committed. So we built our own delivery infrastructure; we built our own delivery men. And up to now, I think we have the feeling of it so we are able to deliver our product as fast as we can to satisfy the customers.\nSo a couple of challenges that I think either the Government in Vietnam or the U.S. Government can help us is, first, is to help us to develop our infrastructure: the logistics, the payments, et cetera, and bring new technology to Vietnam. So that's always been my dream.\nInfrastructure\nThe President. Right. So the—one of the challenges is just making sure that you have the physical infrastructure so that you can deliver fast enough. But in terms of the digital infrastructure, is that well developed, because everybody has a smartphone now?\nMs. Vy It's much, much better now because people are getting used to using their smartphone to order things online. Three years ago, when I first started, it was so difficult to get people online. But now it's very easy. But still—so the operational infrastructure is not there yet, so we need to learn it from successful companies like Amazon, or we need to come up with our own solution in Vietnam. Because the street in Vietnam is not the same in the U.S. You understand, right? So we have all the delivery men in motorbikes. And they have to know their way around. It's very difficult to install GPS for the delivery men.\nAccess to Capital\nThe President. Yes, yes. And just one last question. In terms of access to capital, the—typically, are startups here financed—self-financed or are they financed through the banks? Is there enough of a sort of a bank infrastructure for small businesses and medium-sized businesses? Or are you using—are most entrepreneurs using family savings? Is there venture capital? How are people getting started?\nMs. Vy Well, that's a very good question. To be honest, I think in Vietnam, it's very difficult to get early funding. Especially, there's not that many venture capital funds here in Vietnam. For seed funding and angel investors, very limited. I think most of the investors in Vietnam, they want to invest in companies that have track records, which is quite a challenge for a startup in Vietnam. So we have family startup here. It's a good news for us. And we hope that in the near future, more venture funds can come to Vietnam, especially from America, to help us grow all of the business—all the new businesses.\nAgriculture\nThe President. Well, I'm trying to do some advertising for you here. [Laughter]\nMs. Vy. Thank you very much.\nThe President. Hopefully, somebody is paying attention back in the United States.\nSo, Hằng, you were talking about agriculture. Obviously, a large portion of Vietnam is still dependent on basic agricultural—and small farmers. Is the goal here for them to be able to move their products to market at a better price and more quickly? Or is it that you want to move up the value chain so that there's more processing that's taking place, so it's not just rice or other crops, but it's also the products that are derived from the foodstuffs that are being grown? Or is it all of the above? Tell me a little bit more about how you see the opportunity for agriculture to accelerate here in Vietnam.\nMs. Hằng. I guess all of the above. Of course, by ourselves, we cannot change the whole industries, but with many investors and entrepreneurs working together, we believe we that can make a positive impact. So as I mentioned, there are two parts in our business. One is to apply more technology in agriculture. Some technology is just very, very simple: using text message, using simple tracking tools, simple automation on the farm, greenhouse, et cetera. That improves the productivity massively, and that helps directly the farmers to increase their output and, as a result, their income.\nAnd secondly, basically, have a trusted brand and add more value and bring the products to the end users at a higher price. And obviously, the result of that is also higher income. And we understand that there are a lot of challenges like Vy mentioned. The logistics is not there yet, quite yet. The infrastructure, there is still a lot to do. But we have a very young team in Dalat, in—where our farm is. And we have lot of—I know personally a lot of people, young people who are—who start their work in agriculture. And we have so much passion and energy and drive, and beyond that, we even have a strategy and action plan to make this happen. So hopefully, in the next few years, you'll see some very positive change in agriculture in Vietnam.\nU.S. and Vietnamese Entrepreneurship/Microsoft Corporation\nThe President. Excellent. The—so, Khoa, when you think about business here versus business as you're accustomed to seeing in the United States, what are some of the big differences? And are there particular areas where you think a strategic investment would really make a big difference in helping all these startups take off? And in terms of Microsoft's strategy, is—are your main clients large businesses and just helping them with respect to IT, or are you also working with some of these smaller startups to see how you can grow their businesses and, hopefully, help them really take off?\nMr. Pham. I'm sure you have heard from Satya Nadella, our CEO. Our company mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. And I think there is no better market to do that than in Vietnam, because of the young entrepreneurs that we have here and the Internet penetration, the mobile base that we have here with young people. And I think that in terms of capturing the opportunity, I think that's important for us to look at—for our government—and businesses and entrepreneurs to really balance the opportunity and the responsibility in this new world that we live in, which is the mobile-first, cloud-first world.\nAnd so if you look at the challenges in that respect, I think public policy, regulatory environment, it needs to be more conducive, right? Would be—need to be modernized to address the digital economy. And I think that Vietnam is not unique in that space as a developing market. I think in the U.S., the same is being faced with how do we deal with e-commerce, cross-border taxation issues, and things of that nature. But I think that Vietnam can leapfrog other markets and seeing and capturing that opportunity.\nAnd for Microsoft Vietnam, in particular, we have a national empowerment plan that basically mirrors the Government ICT master plan by 2020 to really develop Vietnam as an ICT-advanced nation. And so, in that regard, we look at the three key pillars, which is the ICT infrastructure of the country, helping really secure the cybersecurity apparatus of the country, really looking at the issue of privacy, data protection, the ICT infrastructure for a national cloud—to really take advantage of that.\nAnd also, our investment, in the second pillar, which is about small and medium-sized enterprises, I think that is going to be the driving factor for the economic growth of this country. We have about 500,000 SMBs, businesses here in that size, and so I would say that the startup community is also the micro businesses that are starting out. And we have programs that provide free software, free cloud services to these startups. So this way, they can really focus on developing the best products.\nAnd then, honestly, the education side, we really have to look at capacity building, and that is to really help the Vietnamese move from a labor-intensive economy into more of a knowledge economy, knowledge-based economy. And that is really getting them with the right skill set for ICT skill sets, and also, we need to really invest a bit more on STEM education. And we're doing that—and teaching with technology in the classrooms and really doing a lot of these startup community, coworking space, community events to really promote coding, because I think that's where it's—that's very important. And I think you were in the K.L. when we did the Hour of Code and where you worked with the Prime Minister and coding with the children. And I think that's something we do here annually as well. Yes.\nEducation\nThe President. Absolutely. The—I think that's a great point, and, Vy and Hằng, maybe you want to talk about this a little bit. Ultimately, what makes startups and entrepreneurs successful is good ideas and the human capital. Obviously, investors are important, and infrastructure is important, but the most important thing is people. And when you look at Vietnam right now, it seems as if a culture of entrepreneurship is really beginning to grow. But one of the questions that I always have to ask myself in the United States is whether our education system is equipping our children effectively enough to be able to move forward on their ideas.\nSo you're both very young, so you can still remember what it's like to go to school. [Laughter] For me, it's—I've forgotten. But I will say that when I was going to school, we didn't have computers. Well, you had these big mainframe computers—[laughter]—but you didn't have personal computers. [Laughter]\nSo, how do you see the education system here adapting to the needs of this new 21st-century economy?\nMs. Vy. Sorry. I still remember taking entrepreneurship classes in the U.S., and I found it so helpful for me to learn about how to write a business plan, how to pitch to an investor, how to develop financial models. And I think when I got back here, I don't find that many entrepreneurship classes in Vietnam. So I think that there's an empty area that we can tap on.\nThe President. Right.\nMs. Vy. And secondly, I think after your startups get funding, I think they also need mentorship program. Those are the things that really helps the startup community here in Vietnam. And I also think that—I used to be an exchange student. I came to U.S. when I was 17. And I'm very thankful for that because I learned so much about innovations, and I learned how to dream big and always hope for a brighter future. So I think there's a chance for us to also create exchange programs, not just for students, but for working adults. Especially, we can send young startups to do on-the-job training or internship programs at some U.S. company. So those are the things that I really wanted to get to the audience.\nThe President. Good. Hằng.\nMs. Hằng. I would like to add to what Vy just said,as the power of technology. Again and again, I go back to this point. With technology, really, students nowadays have access to a lot more information, a lot more well informed, and education opens a new sector for startups to come and basically try to disrupt the sector. So our friend—[inaudible]—he has his own startup, education startup. Another friend that we know very well, Tú, she launched ELSA, that helps students to learn English through an app. So all of those examples you can see that technology basically just opens the doors and opens opportunities for Vietnamese students for access to global knowledge.\nAnd the evidence of that is, most of the team that I work with in Vietnam, from my previous startup, and even at many companies, at Seedcom right now, they all educated in Vietnam. I'm one of the very lucky few that got years of education in the States. But I respect my colleagues a lot every day for—they're so smart. They learn in Vietnam. They learn not only by going to school, but also by doing, by talking to older people, and obviously, learning from the Internet. So I do think technology is changing education.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure/Education\nThe President. Well, Khoa was talking about leapfrogging. One of the things that you're seeing in countries all around the world is, if they hadn't already developed a telephone infrastructure with cellular—or with landlines and telephone poles and underground tunnels, now, suddenly, they just go straight to cellular towers and smartphones. And banking is done there, and commerce is done through phones. And so they've leapfrogged over the infrastructure requirements of old systems.\nAnd the same is true with education. Right? The—if done properly, the opportunity for online education that is much cheaper, but is still of high quality, that can accelerate the ability of a child here in Vietnam to learn coding, learn business practices and so forth, without an expensive education or having to study overseas is hugely important. And with our contribution through the Peace Corps, through entrepreneurship summits, through the sponsorships that we're getting various companies to engage in, our hope is, is that we'll be able to provide the kind of training to young people that will be incredibly powerful for them in the future.\nAnd we want to thank the Vietnamese Government for their cooperation, because a lot of these systems that we're trying to build we could not do if it were not for the strong support that we're receiving from them.\nBut any other closing thoughts that you think either the President of the United States—[laughter]—or the President of Vietnam or any of these business leaders here should hear about?\nPublic Service/Entrepreneurship\nMs. Vy. Mr. President, let me ask you a question. [Laughter]\nThe President. Oh, sure. [Laughter] The tide has turned. [Laughter]\nMs. Vy. So when you were a kid, did you dream of becoming President one day?\nThe President. No. [Laughter] I think there are some people who, they had a very clear vision for themselves. I really didn't—I was not as well organized as all of you when I was young. I think it wasn't until I was in college that I began to develop a sense of wanting to make a difference. And even then, I did not know exactly how I might do it.\nI was actually very skeptical of politics because I thought politicians weren't always looking out for the people; that too often, I thought, they were looking out for themselves. So I actually worked in communities to try to hold politicians accountable. That was the first job that I did in nonprofit—the nonprofit sector.\nSo it wasn't really until, I think, I finished law school that I thought that I might be interested in public service. In fact, I went to law school with my now—is my Trade Representative, our Ambassador Michael Froman. And he was much smarter than me. [Laughter] But it wasn't until I came out of law school that I thought that maybe I might run for office at some point.\nBut the important point, I think, I want to make is that so many of the young people here today—certainly all of you—Khoa, you sort of qualify as young—I'm not——[Laughter]\nMr. Pham. Young at heart.\nThe President. You're young at heart. [Laughter] These two are young. You're sort of—you're younger than me. [Laughter] But so many of the young people I meet today I think have a different idea of their careers and their lives. I think they're much more sophisticated. I think the Internet has exposed them to a lot more ideas of what they can do. I believe that many young people recognize that the old system where you find yourself a job and then you work in that same job for 30 or 40 years is less likely to be the path for them, because the economy is just changing so quickly.\nAnd so I think there's much more interest on the part of all the young people I meet—certainly here in Southeast Asia, in the States, Africa, Europe, wherever I go—to try to make it on their own and to try to find collaborations with groups of people who are interested in the same things they are and to see if they can make it happen. And I think that's a wonderful thing. It's challenging. I think there's—one of the well-known rules in Silicon Valley is, is that if you haven't failed quite a bit, then you're probably not a very good entrepreneur, because the first idea you have is not always going to work. And you have to be resilient and to be able to learn from your failures as much as your successes.\nBut I truly believe that this generation is not only being entrepreneurial when it thinks about business, but also entrepreneurial when it thinks about trying to solve social problems, entrepreneurial when it thinks about government and making government more responsive and accountable to ordinary people. And it makes me very hopeful for the future. So okay, yes.\nMalia Obama/Vietnam-U.S. Student Exchanges\nMs. Hằng. I guess the entrepreneurial spirit is very much ingrained in Vietnamese people, just like for Americans. And you have seen and your staff have seen here the very vibrant startup and business community here in Ho Chi Minh City. Just imagine how much more it can be if there is more exchange—of knowledge, of capital, technical know-how—between the two countries, U.S. and Vietnam.\nAnd on that note, my question for you would be—[laughter]—if your daughter taking a gap year from Harvard College, tell you—tells you next week that she wants to live in Vietnam for a year, what do you tell her?\nThe President. Oh, I would encourage it. But what I've learned is, is that—my daughter Malia will be 18 next month, and she already doesn't listen to me, whatever I say. [Laughter] So the—so if you wanted her to come to Vietnam, I shouldn't be the one to tell her. [Laughter] Maybe you should tell her.\nMs. Hằng. Sure.\nThe President. Yes, absolutely. But I—certainly I would recommend students from the States to come and study here as much as I'm encouraging Vietnamese students to come and study in the United States.\nI—young people are going to be living in a interconnected world, in a global marketplace. And every business has to think globally. Even small businesses. If you have a good product today, you can reach billions of people if you have a good strategy, you have good marketing, you can handle the logistics. And so the barriers to entry that used to exist where only a Boeing or a GE or a very large company could operate in Vietnam is no longer true. And the same is true for small businesses here in Vietnam. If you have a interesting product that is unique and perhaps is very common in Vietnam, but nobody knows about in the United States, oftentimes, one—some of the best ways to start a business is to take something that is very popular one place, but is unknown someplace else and be the first person to sell that product to—in another country.\nSo I think part of the education that young people have to have is to understand other cultures and understand other markets. If you're lucky enough to be able to travel, then that's one way to do it. But one of the wonderful things about the Internet is, it gives you an opportunity to learn about another place, even if you can't set foot there. So that's something that I continually emphasize. So, all right.\nLast question or comment.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement\nMr. Pham. Sure. I have a question. In your opening remarks, you mentioned about TPP, and we didn't have a chance to talk about that. And so TPP is considered a 21st-century trade agreement, dealing directly with the digital economy, talking about the rules of law extending to security and privacy and also cross-border data flow. TPP is very important to Vietnam, and I know that the Vietnamese business community supports it. And as an employee of Microsoft, I can reaffirm that our company supports TPP.\nAs we look at the latest report published by the U.S. International Trade Commission, that indicates that, fully implemented, TPP will bring about $57 billion into the U.S. economy. But currently, the U.S.—American politics is sort of turning against TPP. So what I'd like to hear from you is, what do you think is going to be—what it takes to pass TPP in Washington, DC? And what will you do in your power to make that happen?\nThe President. Well, it's a great question. And first of all, just to describe why TPP is so important. What TPP does is, it takes 12 countries along the Asia-Pacific region that represent a huge portion of the entire world marketplace, and it says we're going to create standards for trade and commerce that are fair; that create a level playing field; that have high standards; that encourage rule of law; that encourage protection of intellectual property so if Vy or Hằng come up with a great idea, somebody is not just going to steal it off the Internet, but the work that they've put in is protected; that has strong environmental provisions so that countries can't just take advantage of no environmental protection to undercut competitors who are following more responsible environmental practices.\nAnd not only do all the countries who are participating stand to gain from increased trade, but Vietnam, in particular, I think economists who have studied it believe would be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\nFrom the United States perspective, it's a commonsense thing to do because, frankly, our markets are already more open than many of the markets of the countries that are signing up. So Japan, for example, is able to sell a lot of cars in the United States, but has a lot of problems importing beef from the United States. And what we've done is to make sure that a lot of the tariffs that are currently being placed on U.S. exports and U.S. goods are reduced.\nAnd so it will create a better environment for U.S. businesses, particularly because of some of the intellectual property protections, a lot of what we sell today are products of our knowledge-based economy. And so it's a smart thing to do across the board.\nNow, the problem in the United States around trade—and this is not new, this has been true for the last 30 years—is that some of the previous trade agreements did not have enforceable labor protections or environmental protections. I think when China came in to the WTO, it was able to take advantage of the growing global supply chain, and a lot of manufacturing shifted to China in a very visible way. So a lot of Americans saw companies close and saw what they viewed as their jobs being exported to China. And some of that happened in Mexico with NAFTA as well.\nAnd so the perception was that this is bad for U.S. workers and U.S. jobs. If you look at the data, then what is true is that some manufacturing jobs were lost as a consequence of trade. On the other hand, other sectors of the economy improved significantly. And overall, it was good for the U.S. economy. But I think that in the design of some of the old trade deals and some of the mistakes that may have been made in the past, people became suspicious of trade and worried that if we do TPP, then the same pattern will repeat itself, and U.S. will lose more jobs.\nMy argument is that if you're dissatisfied with the current trading arrangements where tariffs are placed on U.S. goods, but other people's goods are already coming into the U.S., why would you want to just maintain the status quo? Why not change it so that everybody is operating in a fair and transparent way?\nAnd the good news is, is that the majority of Americans still believe in trade and still believe that it's good for our economy. The bad news is, politics in the United States is not always—how would I put it?—reasonable. [Laughter] That's the word I'm looking for. [Laughter] But I'm confident that we're going to be able to get it done because, in the past when we've negotiated trade deals, even though there's a lot of opposition, at the end of the day, we end up getting it done. Keep in mind that we negotiated a very big free trade agreement with Korea, and even though the Bush administration negotiated it, he didn't get it passed. When I came into office, we—one of the first things we did was, we worked with Korea, we made some small modifications to some of the terms, and we got it done, and it's in force today.\nSo the argument that I've made and I will continue to make in the United States is that we're not going to be able to end globalization. We have to make globalization work for us. And that means that we don't try to put barriers and walls between us and the rest of the world; but instead, we try to make sure that the world has high standards, treats our companies fairly. And if we do that, I'm confident we can compete with anybody.\nSo nothing is easy in Washington these days. But despite sometimes the lack of cooperation with Congress, I seem to be able to get a lot of things done anyway. [Laughter] It could have been easier. I wouldn't—I would have less gray hair—[laughter]—if Congress was working more effectively, but we do have some Members of Congress who are here. That's Congressman Castro and Congressman O'Rourke who are two outstanding young Congressmen from Texas. They're strong TPP supporters, and we're very proud of the work that they've done. So we're just going to have to work hard to convince some of their colleagues. But ultimately, I think we can get it passed.\nWell, everybody, I think that if you had any doubt about the outstanding future of Vietnamese entrepreneurs, then all those doubts have been pushed away because of the outstanding presentations by these three individuals. Give them a big round of applause.\nThank you so much.", "timestamp": "2016-05-24", "title": "Remarks and a Panel Discussion on Entrepreneurship at the DreamPlex Coworking Space in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"}

The measure would prohibit the state from paying more for a prescription drug than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It would make sure that state taxpayers will no longer be ripped off by pharmaceutical companies that charge exorbitant prices for AIDS treatments and other prescription drugs. \"We think it's a great start and we applaud the people of California for standing up to the pharmaceutical industry,\" Sanders said afterward.\nSanders' proposal to provide Medicare-for-all universal health care would also benefit the 1.2 million Americans with HIV/AIDS.\nAt the meeting, Sanders noted that he has introduced a plan to lower costs for HIV/AIDS drugs. His measure would establish a prize fund to provide incentives for drug makers to develop new treatments. Unlike the current system that lets drug makers charge the highest prices in the world for medicine sold in the United States, medical breakthroughs made under the prize fund system would make the new drugs available to the public at affordable prices.\nSanders also agreed to set a national goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by the year 2025 so that HIV is no longer a public health threat to any community in the U.S. and that people with HIV are able to live long, healthy lives.\nSanders also has called for expansion of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program which provides HIV-related services.

Our collaboration on education pre-dates the reestablishment of diplomatic relations in 1995, has been growing annually, and increasingly features innovative partnerships with higher education institutions and companies. Through U.S. assistance, our shared work has already impacted 30,000 university students through curriculum support, training, and capacity building at the faculty and administrative levels in the engineering and social work education sectors. We have expanded this support to the science, technology, engineering, math, and medical education fields. By leveraging expertise and funding from the private sector, our programs in higher education have far-reaching impact and are addressing the demands of a rapidly changing Vietnamese economy.\nThe Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV) will be a watershed in U.S.-Vietnam education cooperation. With over $20 million in investment from the U.S. government, FUV will be the first independent, non-profit university in Vietnam and represents a unique contribution by the United States to Vietnam's development. By modeling core principles including academic freedom, meritocracy, transparency, and equal access, FUV will bring a world-class university to Vietnam and foster greater linkages with the United States.\nHigher education represents one of the best examples of the rapidly growing people-to-people ties between the United States and Vietnam. Examples of the more than twenty years of U.S. assistance in support of the development of Vietnam's higher education system include the following:\nImproving Access, Curriculum and Teaching in Medical Education and Emerging Diseases (IMPACT MED) Alliance: A new USAID alliance with seven private sector partners to help the health workforce address current and future challenges. Working with three Vietnamese universities in each region of the country, the alliance will improve the quality and effectiveness of medical education in Vietnam through training in modern pedagogy, use of technology, and integration of clinical content; improving teaching and learning of key skills necessary to ensure a strong, high quality workforce able to detect, treat and respond to emerging health threats; and developing leadership for continuous and sustainable innovation and improving access and outcomes for socially and economically disadvantaged students, especially ethnic minority doctors and health workers.\n• USAID alliance leads: Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Health Advancement in Vietnam (HAIVN)\n• Private sector partners: IBM, Roche, Johnson & Johnson, GE, Bravo Vietnam, 3M, Samsung\nBuilding University-Industry Learning and Development through Innovation and Technology (BUILD-IT) Alliance: USAID and Arizona State University will launch a new alliance with 14 industry partners. The BUILD-IT Alliance leverages government, industry, and academic partners in the U.S. and Vietnam to link science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) instruction in Vietnamese universities with the needs and capabilities of industry partners. It aims to produce graduates who can lead inclusive, technology-based growth by engaging leadership in strengthening higher education policy; enabling university-private sector collaboration; developing curriculum partnerships, mentorships, and industry-sponsored practical opportunities to build students' professional and technical competencies in preparation for STEM careers; and improving academic programs and outcomes as a whole.\n• Other BUILT-IT U.S. university partners: Catholic University of America, Portland State University\n• Private sector partners: Autodesk, Siemens, Tektronix, Pearson, National Instruments, Microsoft, S.E.N Platform, mobifone, Viettel Group, eSilicon, Intel, Oracle, Everest Education\nThe Fulbright Program: Since 1992, Fulbright has supported more than 500 Americans and nearly 700 Vietnamese for study, research, and teaching. Vietnamese Fulbrighters now occupy leading positions in all sectors. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pham Binh Minh, is a Fulbright alumnus.\nThe Fulbright Economics Teaching Program (FETP) began in 1994 to teach market economics in Vietnam at a time of great transition. It has become a Master's degree program whose 1,200 alumni are guiding Vietnam's economic development, as economic ties with the United States increase exponentially. The Prime Minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, is an alumnus of FETP's Vietnam Executive Leadership Program. FETP will become the Fulbright School of Public Policy and Management within FUV in 2016.\nVietnam Education Foundation (VEF): VEF is an independent U.S. agency created by Congress in 2000 to support Masters and PhD study in science fields by Vietnamese at U.S. institutions. Since 2003, VEF has supported nearly 600 fellowships. VEF is scheduled to sunset in 2018, but its Fellows will continue to serve as a source of U.S.-trained academics to help lead Vietnam's development.\nThere are now 19,000 Vietnamese students attending U.S. universities. Enrollment grew by 13 percent in 2015 alone with the support of the Department of State EducationUSA advising program. Vietnam continues to be the leader in Southeast Asia in this field, and is currently the 9th largest source of foreign students to the United States worldwide. Given that Vietnamese identify education as a top priority, there is much room for continued growth in this sector.", "timestamp": "2016-05-25", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States-Vietnam Education Cooperation"}

Hello, and welcome to the White House for what is my favorite event of the year! (Applause.) Oh, I am thrilled that all of you could be here for our second White House Turnaround Arts Talent Show! (Applause.) And we've spruced it up here. This year, we've upped it. We got lighting and all kinds of atmosphere going on. (Laughter.)\nLet me start by thanking the National Endowment for the Arts and the Department of Education for their leadership and their love and their passion for this program.\nAnd of course, I want to recognize everyone from the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities for their outstanding work. Let's just stop there for a moment. Because this isn't in the remarks, so everybody is like, oh, no, what's she going to say? (Laughter.) You all are champions. You have worked just so hard. You've delivered -- (applause) -- you have delivered on every possible wish, hope that I could have had. And I just thank you all for your wonderful work and your friendship.\nI want to thank Kathy Fletcher, the National Director for Turnaround Arts, for her great work. (Applause.) I want to thank two champions, George and Margo. You two, man, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You have led this so gracefully and passionately. I'm indebted to you, but I love you. Thank you both. (Applause.)\nTo Mary Schmidt Campbell, as well -- Mary Schmidt, thank you. Thank you, Mary. You are amazing. (Applause.) To Damian, Damian Woetzel. Is he performing or doing something? He's usually very involved in everything. There you go, Damian. Thank you, thank you for all your great work. (Applause.) And to Megan Beyer, Megan, thank you. Great job. Great job. You filled in well, doing a great job. Thank you. (Applause.)\nI also want to welcome all of the legendary artists and all the performers and all the folks who have made today possible and have helped us have another terrific year, including Keb' Mo', Tim Robbins, Bernie Williams, Lil' Buck. Happy birthday, again, Lil' Buck. (Laughter.) And so many of you, thank you all for joining us here today. Thank you for loving these kids and working so hard. We couldn't do this. You make this even more special than it is.\nAnd most of all, I want to recognize the stars of today's show, our students who are here from all over the country. We have students here from New York, my home state of Illinois, Iowa. (Laughter.) Chicago? (Applause.) We're a little nuts like that. (Laughter.) Minnesota. (Applause.) So you can't be outdone. (Laughter.) Louisiana. (Laughter and applause.) Connecticut. (Applause.) Cali, California. (Applause.) And my adopted home state of Hawaii. (Applause.) My in-law state. (Laughter.) And my current hometown, right here in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nNow, for many of you, this isn't your first trip to the White House. Over the years, Turnaround Arts students have helped us welcome visitors from around the world, including just two weeks ago when some of the students from the Savoy Elementary School performed for the spouses of leaders from the Nordic countries at our state dinner at the Renwick Gallery. Megan hosted that. And they made the spouses cry, I'll just leave it at that. They were amazing. And today, I understand that you're all going to be bringing down the house with your singing and dancing. So I can't wait to see what you all have pulled together. I've heard you from upstairs. (Laughter.) My staff has said, these kids are going buck wild in here. (Laughter.) That was a quote. Tina, I won't tell you from who. (Laughter.)\nBut before we get to the show, I want to just take a moment to talk to you about how we got here, and why we will not rest until every single student in America has the kind of opportunities you all have given these students to engage with the arts.\nIt was about five years ago, and across the country, arts classes were being cut back or eliminated altogether. Over a million students weren't getting any music education, and nearly 4 million students had no access to the visual arts at all. And these were serious losses for our young people, because we all know that kids who get involved in the arts have better grades. They have fewer behavioral problems. They're more likely to graduate, and they're more likely to go to college.\nSo the PCAH had also just released a report showing that arts education was the key to getting students excited about academics and possibly even turning around an entire school.\nNow, my husband was already working to bring new resources to some of our nation's lowest-performing schools –- schools where test scores were low and teacher turnover was high. And where many folks were ready to give up and shut these schools down for good, we saw potential. And the PCAH decided to put our ideas about the arts to the test to see if schools like these could be turned around all across the country. And that's how Turnaround Arts began.\nAnd it started with just eight schools, and they brought in art supplies and instruments. They trained teachers, enlisted some of our biggest corporations and non-profits, and recruited renowned artists to adopt schools. Musicians like Yo-Yo Ma and Trombone Shorty, they organized workshops. Artists like Chuck Close, who is here with us today -- Chuck, who is behaving himself. He told me. (Laughter.) Chuck helped to arrange exhibits of students' work. Actors like Sarah Jessica Parker and Kerry Washington taught theater classes and helped stage plays. And the results were beyond our wildest imagination.\nJust take the example of Northport Elementary School in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. Back in 2013, less than half of their students had proficient scores on state reading, math, and science tests, and morale was very low. But then they became a Turnaround Arts school, and they started including the arts in every part of the curriculum. The music teacher helped students break down rap lyrics in English class -- the precursor to \"Hamilton.\" (Laughter.) They started it in Minnesota. Lin doesn't want to admit it, but it was really the English class. (Laughter.) They hired full-time staff members to teach drama and dance. And businesses like Target and Home Depot donated materials so that over 150 students, staff and community members could paint murals and plant flowers on the school grounds.\nAnd within two years, their test scores improved. They went from almost 200 student suspensions per year to 41, and Northport was actually removed from the state's list of schools that are the furthest behind. As Principal Leona Derden, who is here with us today -- Principal Derden, are you here? There you go. (Applause.) These are her words, she said, \"The arts made the difference in the lives of our students.\" And we're so proud of you and all of the other principals and administrators who are here.\nAnd this school's experience wasn't unusual. The Turnaround Arts program has been rigorously evaluated, and participating schools across the country have reported that class attendance and parental engagement is up. Math scores have soared by an average of more than 20 percent, and reading scores have improved by more than 10 percent. SO that's some good outcomes right there.\nNow, of course, a lot of factors go into turning around a school -- factors like having a great principal, having wonderful teachers, having engaged students, committed parents. But this program helped show that the arts could be an essential part of this strategy. And once word of these excellent results got out, school districts across the country started clamoring to get involved. And by next year, Turnaround Arts will be in 68 schools reaching over 30,000 students nationwide. That's terrific. (Applause.) Well done.\nSo make no mistake about it, this program isn't just turning around schools, it's turning students' lives around as well. Take the example of Lionnell Wilson. He's a 6th grader at the Jettie Tisdale School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Just last year, Lionnell was having trouble with attendance, and he was one of the shyest kids, I understand, in his grade. But fortunately, Jettie Tisdale is a Turnaround Arts school with an excellent theater program. And when they held a casting call for a \"Willy Wonka\" musical last fall, Lionnell worked up the courage and decided to try out. And I understand his voice blew the judges away.\nAfter he was cast as one of the leads, he didn't dream of missing rehearsals, so his attendance problems disappeared. And then, of course, his grades started improving, and he then became a leader among his peers.\nYou were recording me and recording it back, weren't you? (Laughter.) I was like, that sounds familiar, that voice! (Laughter.) I just said that! But we'll get this for you. We'll make sure you get a copy. (Laughter.)\nBut here's the good news -- the special news is that we're going to hear from Lionnell today as the featured soloist in his school's big song. (Applause.) So he's here in the flesh, and he's going to sing for us! And I'm so excited.\nSo when we say that the arts are an essential part of our kids' education, this is really what we're talking about. We mean that no one should ever think that dance and music and theater are a luxury -- I say this every year -- because for so many of our students, they are truly necessities. They're the reason these kids show up. That's why we're putting on this show today. And that's why we're shining a big bright light on all these incredible students and all the administrators and the others who have made this program possible.\nBut here's the thing: For every student who is represented here today, we know that there are so many others who still don't have access to the arts. So while we're proud of the progress we've made, we know that we are nowhere near finished. We need to keep on advocating for arts education. We need to keep on expanding the Turnaround Arts Program, no matter who is sitting in the Oval Office next year -- absolutely. (Applause.) We may have started this program in the Obama administration, but it needs to be part of every administration from here on out. Yes, again. (Applause.)\nAnd that's why my husband included funding for arts education in his budget and why we are implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act that he signed last year, which will help give more of our kids the well-rounded education they need. And that's also why today, I am particularly proud to announce a new Turnaround Arts partnership with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This is good stuff. (Applause.)\nAs folks in this room may know, the Kennedy Center features world-renowned arts education programming, and they will be putting those amazing resources to use to help expand Turnaround Arts to even more schools and bring the arts to even more students across America. In other words, this might be the last Turnaround Arts Talent Show I'm hosting in the White House, but we are all committed to continuing this work to promote the arts and lift up students, and turn around schools nationwide for years to come.\nI am just grateful for all of those who worked so hard to make this partnership possible, that this isn't the end, that this is the beginning of the conversation. And I want everybody out there to understand that these are real results. These are real kids and real schools that can be so much different and so much better if we give these kids what every other kid, our kids, have -- arts and sports and reading and love. They all deserve it, and with it they flourish.\nSo I am grateful to you all for this work. It has been an amazing seven and a half years being with you all. This is the highlight of much of what I do as First Lady, and seeing the faces on these kids and having them here in the house running around, making noise, eating the food. It is just the best. It is the absolute best. (Laughter.)\nSo with that I'm going to stop talking so that we can get on with the fun, because it's time for the show! Thank you so much, everyone. God bless.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120976", "text": "The following Q & A was featured on Playbill.com in conjunction with today's Turnaround Arts Talent Show. You can read the full article here.\nTheatre and the arts are often seen as extracurricular activities. Since launching Turnaround Arts, you've seen how the introduction of arts within schools completely changes the environment. Attendance, behavior, grades and parental engagement are all positively affected. Why do you think the arts have the ability to achieve this?\nMichelle Obama: We've been blown away by the impact the Turnaround Arts program has had on schools across the country. Class attendance is way up; math scores have risen by an average of more than 20 percent; and reading scores have improved by more than 10 percent.\nBut when you think about it, that's not all that surprising. After all, the research clearly shows that kids who are involved in the arts have better grades and fewer behavioral problems, and they're more likely to graduate and go to college. For so many of these kids, their engagement in the arts is what gets them out of bed in the morning. It gives them something to look forward to. And while they might show up to school every day because they're excited about their art, music or theatre class, once they're in those seats, we can teach them math, reading and science—and we can use the arts to get them excited about those subjects, so they'll improve their academic performance as well.\nThat's why I'm so thrilled that the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities will be forging a new partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to implement and expand the Turnaround Arts program. The Kennedy Center will be bringing its world-renowned arts education programming to even more schools—and even more students—across the country. I am so grateful to the Kennedy Center for making this commitment, and I cannot wait to see all the young people they engage and inspire and all the schools they help transform.\nWhat kind of artistic legacy do you want to leave behind?\nMichelle Obama: One of my goals as First Lady has been to open the doors of the White House as wide as possible and showcase a variety of American art forms. Over the years, we've hosted all kinds of performances—including country, jazz, modern dance, Broadway show tunes, and more – just about any genre you can imagine, we've had it at the White House.\nAnd when we host these performances, we ask performers to come a few hours early and run workshops for young people, particularly kids from underserved communities who wouldn't normally have a chance to visit the White House. More than anything else, that's the artistic legacy I want to leave behind—a legacy of openness, inclusion and inspiration for our young people.\nYou've spoken about your passion for theatre—and you've hosted theatre performances, including by the cast of Hamilton, at the White House. What is it about the power of theatre that made it something you wanted to highlight and share with young people?\nMichelle Obama: I had the privilege of seeing the Off-Broadway version of Hamilton last year, and I loved every minute of it. The cast was extraordinary—some of the most talented, diverse performers you'll ever see. And they really made history come alive, revealing all the intrigue, heartbreak, drama and glory that run through our past and showing us how the folks in our textbooks were real people with real talents, but also real flaws.\nI was so excited to share the magic of Hamilton with young people, because I believe that this is how history should be taught. And I wanted to get them excited about learning about our nation's past—I wanted to light a spark in them so that they would walk away eager to learn more.\nAnd just as important, I wanted to expose more young people to the power of theatre, because so often, our kids just don't have access to it, or their families simply can't afford it. Lin-Manuel [Miranda], the creator of Hamilton, and the cast and crew have done so much to bring the show and its lessons to young people from all different backgrounds, and I would love to see more efforts like that all across the country.\nWhat would you like to see every-day citizens doing to help foster the arts within their own communities? Are there ways—ranging from the individual to big businesses—that we can get involved and make a difference?\nMichelle Obama: I think the Turnaround Arts program offers a perfect example of the many ways people can support the arts in their communities. That program is a real team effort—everyone plays a role, from teachers embracing the arts in their classrooms, to parents encouraging their kids to get involved, to businesses that donate money and supplies.\nPeople across the country can also do their part by standing up and speaking out for the arts. When you hear that the schools in your community are cutting arts programming, write a letter in your local newspaper or show up for a school board meeting to push back. Encourage local businesses to help support arts education. And be sure to show up for as many performances, exhibits and concerts as you can—every ticket sold and seat filled makes a difference.", "timestamp": "2016-05-25", "title": "Playbill Q&A with First Lady Michelle Obama"}

Thank you! Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you very much. Well, xin chào.\nAudience members. Xin chào!\nThe President. Thank you, Tú, for the excellent introduction and your outstanding work to help more young people in Vietnam get an education. Give Tú a big round of applause for—[applause]. It's not that easy introducing the President of the United States. [Laughter] Also, because the podium was a little higher than her. [Laughter]\nI want to thank everybody at the GEM Convention Center for hosting us. I want to thank the Government and the people of Vietnam for the wonderful hospitality that you've extended to me over the past 3 days. I have been deeply touched.\nWherever I travel around the world, obviously, one of my jobs is to meet with government leaders. And these meetings are important. But it means that I spend a lot of time with older people like me. There's a lot of gray hair in the room. [Laughter] So one of my favorite parts of the trips I take overseas is to get out of the government offices and to spend time with young people like you. It's fun. It gives me incredible optimism about the future, because all of you embody the energy and the drive that is helping to propel this region to new heights. You make me hopeful about the future of ASEAN, hopeful about the future of the world. And so that's what I want to briefly talk about before I start taking your questions.\nAs I think all of you know, I have a strong personal connection to this part of the world, to the Asia-Pacific and to Southeast Asia. I was born in Hawaii, spent most of my childhood in Hawaii. But I also spent time in Indonesia as a young boy. My sister was born in Jakarta. So this region helped to shape me. It is also why I really like the food. [Laughter] And I have to say that the food I've had since I've been here, I've been really happy with.\nNow, as President, a key part of my foreign policy is to deepen our ties with countries and the peoples of Southeast Asia. And we've done that. We've deepened the ties with our allies and our partners. We've engaged more with institutions like ASEAN. We're pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership to grow our economies and to support jobs in our countries. Together, we're promoting peace and encouraging sustainable development. We're protecting our environment and trying to meet shared challenges like climate change.\nBut government and businesses are only part of the equation. If we're going to meet all of these challenges, we also have to build strong relationships between our people and especially between young people like you and young people in other ASEAN countries.\nKeep in mind that here in Vietnam, two-thirds of you were born after 1975. As I often say to young Americans back home, your generation can look at the world with fresh eyes, without some of the old notions, the old habits of a previous generation. And that gives you the perspective and the power not just to help to grow Vietnam, but also to help shape the world.\nThanks to technology and social media, you're the most connected generation in history. I see it in my daughters, who are always on the phone—[laughter]—and they have to teach me how to use the phone. [Laughter] More than 30 million people in Vietnam, one-third of the population, are on Facebook—just on Facebook. You're posting selfies. [Laughter] I know. I was in the gym this morning; people were trying to take selfies. [Laughter] You're streaming the latest Sơn Tùng M-TP hit. [Applause] Right? [Laughter] But you're also exchanging ideas and learning from each other.\nAnd so this gives you tremendous power. And we need your passion and energy and talents to tackle some of our biggest global challenges, whether it's reducing poverty, to advancing equality for women and girls, to fighting climate change.\nNow, even in this digital age, as Tú pointed out, change doesn't happen overnight. It requires that you stay active and involved over the long term. And it requires you to develop some practical tools. And that's why, 3 years ago, I launched the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, or YSEALI. And the goal is to empower young people like you with the skills and the resources and the networks that you need to turn your ideas into action.\nSince we started this, the YSEALI network has grown to more than 67,000 members across all 10 ASEAN countries, including over 13,000 here in Vietnam alone. And we've welcomed more than 350 YSEALI Fellows to the United States, including some of you, with more than 200 coming in the next 6 months.\nSo a lot of what we do in YSEALI is rooted in the power and importance of education. That's why nearly 19,000 Vietnamese students studying in the United States right now are helping to bring back the kinds of skills and talents that Vietnam will need to continue to grow and develop. It's why, on this visit, we announced a new partnership between American universities like Arizona State and Vietnamese universities to boost training in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine. It's why we announced that, for the first time, the Peace Corps will be coming to Vietnam, with a focus on teaching English.\nAnd it's why we announced that we're moving ahead this fall with Fulbright University Vietnam, right here in Ho Chi Minh City, the country's first nonprofit, independent university. And the goal is to make sure that Vietnamese students, no matter what their background, has access to a world-class education that's rooted in Vietnam's rich culture and fueled by the free exchange of ideas.\nAnd I want to thank Senator—former Senator Bob Kerrey, who is here, who's been one of the key people to help lead this effort. Thank you very much, Bob.\nSo all these efforts reflect our belief in you: in your ability to keep moving Vietnam forward. And there are some incredible young people who are here who are great examples of the incredible talent and drive of young people in Vietnam today. For example, I see Vietnam's promise in Ngân ĐĐặng. Where's Ngân? Somewhere. There you are right there.\nSo, I had a chance to meet Ngân when I welcomed our YSEALI Fellows to the White House. She started as a volunteer—she started a volunteer group to work with street children and orphans and people with physical disabilities right here in Ho Chi Minh City. So far, they've recruited some 450 volunteers, delivered over 7,000 hours of mentoring, built 5 libraries in 2 cities. And that's just one example of the incredible work that's being done by young people right here in Vietnam. We're very proud of you. Thank you. Thank you, Ngân.\nCouple other people I want to point out. We've got Loc Le Xuan. Where's Loc?\nQ. [Inaudible] The President. There he is right there. So Loc teaches at Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam National University. He's a researcher at the Pasteur Institute. His dream is to go back to his hometown and open a medical center so he can deliver quality, affordable health care. He also helped start Give2Give, which works with YSEALI members across ASEAN to improve their skills and build stronger networks. So we're very excited about the work that you're doing, Loc. Thank you so much.\nI'm going to close with one more story just to give you an example of the incredible work that's being done by young people. Elizabeth Phu is here, I think, and was born here. In the aftermath of the war, Liz and her family became refugees; Liz was barely 4 years old. They packed themselves into a boat; they began a dangerous journey. Pirates ransacked their boat. But they made it to a refugee camp in Malaysia and, eventually, in 1979, to America. With just $20 in their pocket, Liz's parents started to build a new life in California. They taught their children about the importance of education. And after years of studying and hard work, Liz, a proud Vietnamese American, ended up becoming one of my top advisers on Asia in the White House. And we've relied on her for all kinds of incredible policy work that we've done over the last several years.\nSo Tú, Ngân, Loc, Liz, so many of you—you're already showing that you can change the world to reflect our best values. You're showing that with determination and commitment and optimism and hard work, anything is possible. And that's why I'm so hopeful about the future between the United States and Vietnam; that our relationship will continue to grow deeper and stronger. But I'm also optimistic that you're going to be able to change the region and the world in so many positive ways. So as the great Trần Lập sang, \"the path to glory days is getting closer.\" So cám on.\nAnd so, with that, now is the time for me to start taking some questions. I don't know if you've been briefed, but we have microphones in the audience. I'm going to just call on people, and I'm going to go boy, girl, boy, girl so it's fair. [Laughter] If you can keep your questions relatively short so that we can get as many questions as possible. And introduce yourself before you ask the question so we know who you are. Okay? So, I'm going to start right here. Yes. And we've got a microphone coming.\nEntrepreneurship/Trans-Pacific Partnership/Vietnam-U.S. Trade\nQ. Okay, good morning, Mr. President. My name is—[inaudible]—from Ho Chi Minh City. And we are a hundred-percent Vietnamese-owned company that produce high-end plastic products and components in the supporting industries. And today it is our honor to meet with the President, and we have an ambition to request for your help. And that is, we would like to be given opportunities to approach the leading enterprises in the United States, especially in the sector of consumer electronics, automotive, and airline industries, and other plastic-related products for supporting industries. And so, under your help, we could be able to join and be the supplier in the direct supply chain. And we are committed to share the values of integrity and accountability. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Well, thank you so much. I—as you know, one of the things that we're really emphasizing is entrepreneurship, the idea of people starting their own businesses, selling goods across borders, creating jobs, creating great products and services. And yesterday I had a chance to meet with a number of young Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are already starting to create digital platforms to sell goods, not just in Vietnam, but also overseas. This is one of the reasons why we're pushing very hard for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. Because what that does is, it reduces the barriers between countries for selling their goods and services. It gives opportunities not just to big companies, but also to small companies to enter into the global supply chain. It raises labor standards and environmental standards so that all countries are working on a level playing field. And if we can get that done—and the goal is, I think, to try to complete TPP before the end of this year—then that will open up a lot of opportunities and create great confidence among investors here in Vietnam and U.S. companies who are interested in working with young people like you who may have a great idea.\nNow, my general rule in all this is not to actually broker deals and sign contracts. [Laughter] That's somebody else's job. My job is to make sure that we have the kinds of rules in place that make it easier for businesses to get to know each other, to meet. And one of the things that we're doing with the Vietnamese Government is constantly looking for opportunities for trade missions, for businesses to come and learn about what's going on.\nAnd so what we'll do is, we'll make sure that, through the consulate or through the Embassy, if and when we have U.S. businesses who are coming here to Vietnam and are interested in meeting young entrepreneurs, that you'll have an opportunity potentially to present your ideas and see if you can make a deal. All right? Good luck.\nAll right, it's a gentleman's turn. All right, this guy, he looks very happy, right here. [Laughter]\nThe President's Leadership Advice\nQ. Hello, sir.\nThe President. Hello!\nQ. Yes, my name is—[inaudible]. I'm a student in Vietnam National University. I have two questions for you. The first one is that you are a very great leader, and we are young leaders. Do you have any advice that how can we be great like you?\nThe President. Oh, wow. [Laughter] Okay. Now, what's the second question?\nQ. Yes, and the second question is, we are young leaders. Do you have any suggestions that how can we have to strengthen the relationship between Vietnam and the America?\nThe President. Okay, well, the—well, first of all, let me tell you, that when I was your age, I was not as well organized and well educated and sophisticated as all of you. When I was young, I fooled around a lot. [Laughter] I didn't always take my studies very seriously. And I was more interested in basketball and girls. [Laughter] And I wasn't always that serious. So you're already way ahead of me. You're doing good.\nWhenever I meet with young people and they ask me this question, my most important advice is to find something that you care deeply about, find something that excites you, and put all your energy and effort into it, because the path for everybody is different. Some people are very passionate about education. Some people are very passionate about medicine. Some people are passionate about business.\nAnd so there's no one path to ending up being a leader. People sometimes think that to be a leader you have to be a great—you have to make great speeches or you have to be in politics. But there are a lot of ways to lead. Some of the greatest leaders are people who are behind the scenes. So, for example, in the United States, during the civil rights movement that helped to create opportunities for people like me—because at the time, African Americans couldn't fully participate in society—everybody here has heard of Martin Luther King, but there were all these young organizers, your age—people like Bob Moses and John Lewis, and others who were helping go into poor communities and registering voters and getting them active and getting them involved. And they were enormous leaders, amazing leaders, even though they never made big speeches in front of big crowds.\nBut you have to feel passionate about something. And one of the things that I always tell young people is, don't worry so much about what you want to be, worry more about what you want to do. And what I mean by that is, if you are passionate about your work, then naturally, over time, you are going to rise, and people will admire and respect what you've done. But if all you're thinking about is, I want to be a member of the National Assembly, or I want to be very rich, or I want to be this or I want to be that, then you pay less attention to the actual work in front of you.\nAnd most of the people I meet who are very successful, in any field, are people who just love their work. So Bill Gates, who started Microsoft, he didn't start off thinking, I want to be a multibillionaire. He started off thinking, I really like computers, and I want to find out how I can create really neat software.\nAnd people—I didn't start off thinking I wanted to be President of the United States. When I finally stopped fooling around and I wanted to get serious, what I decided was that I wanted to help people in low-income communities, poor people, have opportunity. And so I went to work in poor neighborhoods in Chicago. And because I was interested in the work, I started asking questions: Okay, how can I get more education dollars for these communities? How can I get better housing built in these communities? And that's when I became more aware of how politics worked. And I started asking questions about how could I have more influence and how could I build organizations that could potentially deliver the things that I was interested in. And that's what led me into politics. But I didn't start off saying I want to be President. I started off saying I wanted to help these people.\nSo I—so that's my most important advice. Decide what it is that you care about deeply, and then put everything you have into doing that. If you're interested in social media and you want to start a company, then focus on that. And if you're interested in health care for people in villages around Vietnam, focus on that. And if you get good at that, naturally, you'll end up being a leader, and you'll have opportunities to do great things in the future.\nAll right? Good. Okay, it's a young lady's turn. Here you go, since you got such a—when you've got the paddy hat with the \"Thank you, Obama\"—see, that was good organizing. So go ahead. [Laughter] She came prepared.\nVietnam's Son Doòng Cave/UNESCO World Heritage Site Designation Process/Climate Change\nQ. I am. So thank you very much, President, for your very inspiring speeches. My name is—[inaudible]. I'm from an organization called Save Son Doòng. So yesterday I literally—[applause]—thank you. I literally burst to tears when you mentioned preserving the cave for our children, our grandchildren. That is something that we have been trying to do for the past few years. So my questions for you is that, because Son Doòng is not just belong to Vietnam, it is a world heritage, how would you, an American leader, a global citizen, preserve it? And you also mentioned that you would like to get back to Vietnam. If you have a chance to visit Son Doòng, would you like to do it on foot by trekking, or would you take a cable car, if unfortunately, there's one?\nThe President. Well——\nQ. And also I have a gift——\nThe President. You've got a shirt for me.\nQ. ——that, it would be my honor if you accept this gift.\nThe President. Well, that's a beautiful shirt, so——\nQ. Thank you so much.\nThe President. The—well, first of all, I definitely want to go visit the next time I come. And I'm a pretty healthy guy, so I can go on foot. I'm—it's, uh—how long is it? [Laughter]\nQ. It can take 7 days.\nThe President. Seven days. [Laughter] Okay, I'm good. All right. [Laughter] I can do that. Is—are there places to get something to eat along the way—[laughter]—or do I have to carry my own food?\nQ. We will carry it for you.\nThe President. Oh, well, no, I'll carry it myself. I'm—yes.\nThe—well, look, I think that the possible designation of a world heritage site is a complex process. It would involve I think working with the Government of Vietnam, with existing organizations that designate world heritage sites. We'll be happy to work with your organization, with the Vietnamese Government, and others about the possibilities of doing that.\nBut I do think that one of the great things about your generation is, is that you're already much more conscious about the environment than my generation was or previous generations were. And that's really important not only to preserve beautiful sites in our countries, but also because economic development and the well-being and the health of your people and everyone around the world is going to depend on how we deal with some of these environmental issues.\nNow, to some degree, this is not fair, I think it's important to note, because if you think about Western industrial development, before we knew anything about climate change, they used enormous amounts of carbon energy, and we in the United States have a huge carbon footprint and for 100 years or 150 years were helping to warm the planet. So it's not entirely fair, then, to say to countries that are developing now, well, you have to stop because of climate change.\nBut the problem is, is that if a country like Vietnam or China or India took the same development path that the West did, we're all going to be under water, because the climate is going to warm up so quickly and the climate patterns are going to change, that, in fact, the terrible consequences could actually impede development rather than advance development.\nThat's why we had this agreement in Paris to have all countries join together to deal with climate change. And what it says is, is that each country at different stages of development has different obligations. The United States, we have to do more. Countries like China that are large have to do more. But everybody has to do something. And we all have an obligation then also to help developing countries find new paths for energy and development that are environmentally friendly, developing clean energy strategies that can leapfrog over the old, dirty industries and immediately go to the clean industries.\nNow, the good news is, I think that can happen. Because if you think about—everybody here has a cell phone, I assume, right? Everybody has a smartphone? Yes, you do. Of course, you do. [Laughter] Well, in many countries like Vietnam, you didn't start off with a lot of phone towers and digging and laying telephone lines under the ground. You've leapfrogged the old technologies and immediately went to a cellular technology and a wireless technology. Well, the same that we're—same thing that we're doing with communications, that's what we need to do with energy.\nAnd so, instead of going through the same energy usage in developing and providing electricity and power, we need to start immediately finding cleaner energy sources, which can create jobs and businesses and opportunities all throughout this region. And I'm very excited about the possibilities of doing that.\nSo we have to think about beautiful areas that need to be preserved. But we also have to recognize that no matter how well we preserve one or two areas in each country, if the overall climate patterns change radically, then we're all going to be in a really difficult situation. And you're already starting to see the effects of climate change here in Vietnam. I think this country is going to be one of the most affected. And in someplace like the Mekong Delta, you have drought on the one hand, but you also have saline intrusion on the other hand. And that could have a huge impact on Vietnam's ability to feed its people, on fishermen, on farmers. And it could be a really, really big problem if we don't do something about it. So it's going to be up to you to start, and I'm going to want to partner with you to make that happen.\nThanks for the T-shirt also.\nAll right, so let's see. Oh, you've got flags and everything. [Laughter] Gentleman right here.\nThe President's Young Leaders Initiatives/Post-Presidency Plans\nQ. Good morning, President Obama. My name is Tấn Phát. I'm from SIT Study Abroad, which brings American students to come to Vietnam to learn. So my question is that, as you said earlier, YSEALI is your initiative, and I know that you want to leave the White House very soon, so I'm wondering, when you leave, how you—do you come up any plans to handle for the next President to maintain this very good idea? Thanks.\nThe President. Well, it's a great question. Yes, this is something that we're already planning. Our expectation is, is that the next President will want to continue the incredible work that we've done with the YSEALI. It's not just, by the way, young people in Southeast Asia that we're doing this with. We have a Young African Leaders program that involves young people from 50 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. We have a Latin American version that brings young people together. And at some point, we're going to bring key leaders from each of these areas so that they can start learning from each other.\nAnd our hope is, is that the State Department will continue this program. But one of the things—people always ask me, what am I going to do after I leave the Presidency. Because I'm still relatively young—not compared to you, but I'm—compared to other Presidents, I'm pretty young. And I don't know everything that I'm going to do, but the one thing I do know I will continue to work on is developing young leaders in the United States and around the world. So, in addition to my hope that the next President continues the program through the State Department, I'll make sure that through my philanthropy and my own work that we're continuing to bring young people together so that we can start building the kind of talent that knows each other and is networked and is connected and is learning from each other. Because that's what it's going to take for countries in the future to be able to solve these big problems.\nIf you ask me what I'm most excited about in terms of my legacy 20 years from now, I would feel really good if I see 10,000 or 20,000 or 50,000 young leaders who are now taking over governments and businesses and nonprofit organizations, and they now know each other from different countries, and they've worked together, and they've built trust, and they've built relationships. And if I can help facilitate that, that would be something that I'd be very proud of. So you can guarantee that I'll continue to work on this. Good.\nAll right, yes, right here. Oops. Is it working? Mike ready? Here we go, switch it up.\nQ. My name is—[inaudible]—hello, hello?\nThe President. Uh-oh. I might—you might end up needing to use mine.\nQ. Oh! Hello?\nThe President. All right, it's working?\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. Oh, okay, there you go. Just in time. [Laughter]\nQ. Good morning, President Obama. I'm a YSEALI Academy Fellow, 2015, in the University of Montana.\nThe President. Excellent. How do you like Montana?\nQ. It's not cold, it's too hot.\nThe President. Oh, it's very cold. You just haven't—what, have you gone through January yet?\nQ. Summer batch, luckily.\nThe President. When did you get there?\nQ. June to August.\nThe President. Well it's not—yes, it's not cold in June and August. [Laughter]\nQ. Luckily.\nThe President. You just went there at the right time. But it's a beautiful State, isn't it?\nQ. Yes. I love it.\nThe President. Yes, it's lovely. You—some gorgeous mountains. Have you learned how to fish?\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. Fly fishing?\nQ. Yes. I went rafting as well.\nThe President. And rafting also.\nQ. Yes. The President. That's great.\nVietnam's Mekong Delta/Association of Southeast Asian Nations/President's Post-Presidency Plans/U.S. Politics\nQ. So my topic is about global environmental issues. So I'm going to make my professor in Montana happy by asking a question related to climate change——\nThe President. Good.\nQ. ——and environment. So, in the Mekong region, there a lot of hydropower dams are being built on the mainstream of the Mekong. And this problem is not easy because we have big countries and small countries related to the hydropower building in the area.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. So do you have any suggestions for all the governments of the Mekong region to get together and sustain the interests, both economic and environmental interests in region?\nAnd just one more question.\nThe President. Yes. [Laughter]\nQ. It's like a very typical job interview. Where do you find yourself in 5 years? [Laughter] Because I think it's a very interesting period when Malia probably graduates from Harvard University and you still struggle with computer or iPhone 10. [Laughter] And also that's when probably maybe Mr. Sanders or Mr.—Mrs. Hillary or maybe Mr. Trump finish his—their President's term. So what—where do you find yourself and the world in 5 years? Thank you.\nThe President. Well, the—first of all, on the Mekong Delta, we actually, through ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, created a Mekong Delta working group with all the countries that are impacted. And we're, through our State Department and various programs, we're working to help them plan and create sustainable development across countries.\nNow, you're right that one of the big challenges is how do you deal with water resources and the building of dams and hydropower. And that's not a problem that's unique to the Mekong Delta. You see this in a lot of parts of the world where big projects get built with unintended consequences, and it has severe effects downstream. And the results in some cases have been not great. And have had significant environmental degradation because of lack of planning.\nSo what we're going to try to do is to continue to work with the affected countries and to provide them with the technical assistance and the evaluations of what needs to happen, what they need to watch out for. And hopefully, that information is power. That information then can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects.\nBut one of the things that we've seen in ASEAN is, when small countries band together as a unit, then their power is magnified. That's true on economic issues; that's true on environmental issues; that's true on security issues. And we've seen, since I was President—since I became President, I think, a greater willingness of the ASEAN countries to do more substantive work. It used to be, I think, ASEAN would meet, and everybody was very polite, but you didn't always have, I think, as many specific, concrete plans of action. And now you're starting to see, I think, ASEAN being used as a much more effective tool for policymaking, and the environmental area is a critical place where that can happen. In terms of where I see the world in 5 years, some of you are going to be doing great things, and I'll be very excited to find out what you're doing. I suspect that I'm going to be doing the kinds of work that I'm—that I've been doing all my life. I'll be doing organizing work and involved in public policy issues. But I just won't be doing it in a formal way through elected office. I'll be like a community organizer, except a little more famous than I used to be. [Laughter]\nIn terms of American politics, I tend to be positive and optimistic about American politics. I think sometimes other countries look at our election system, and we think—and people think, wow, what a mess. [Laughter] But usually, we end up doing okay because the American people are good people, and they have—as I hope you've met, you've gotten to know people in Montana—the American people are generous, and they're decent, and they're hard working. And sometimes, our politics doesn't express all the goodness of the people. But usually, eventually, the voters make good decisions, and democracy works.\nSo I'm optimistic that we'll get through this period, and of—one of the great things about the United States is that even when it makes mistakes, I think it's able to adjust and recognize our mistakes, and then we correct course and take different steps. So things are going to be okay, I promise. [Laughter]\nGo ahead. All right. Let's see, all right. This guy, he has two hands up and a symbol. I don't know what that means, but—[laughter]. I don't know, it was interesting, so we'll call on him. Maybe he'll explain it.\nQ. Yes, hello.\nThe President. Hello.\nQ. Mr. President. I want to say that you are so handsome. [Laughter]\nThe President. Oh, okay! [Laughter] The—well that's—you can just stop there if you want. [Laughter]\nQ. Okay. The two questions of me—now turn a little bit into business.\nThe President. Business.\nQ. Yes. You told us just find something you are completely care about, and my biggest care about is human resource management or talent management. And now——\nThe President. Hotel management, did you say?\nQ. Talent management.\nThe President. Talent management.\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. Got it.\nEntrepreneurship/Vietnam's Business Environment\nQ. Okay, now we are joining AEC and TPP. This mean that, beside opportunities, we have many challenges. The more challenge that—they have many, like, overseas companies, they want to attract Vietnamese talent. And can you give, like, a suggestion? We cannot just base on the patriotism of them to force them to stay in Vietnam. They have a chance to seek for their, like, own development. So how can Vietnamese firms and Vietnam Government can have them stay and contribute to Vietnam? And one more question about entrepreneurship. In the—[inaudible]—there is more—like startup company who have a lack of human resource because they move from other countries. And how can the young entrepreneurs can deal with it? Can you give me any suggestion? Thank you.\nThe President. Okay. The—well, look, if I understood your question—so TPP, you've got these new opportunities. Companies are going to be interested in coming into Vietnam as investors or as business partners with existing Vietnamese companies. And I think that any good foreign company is going to want to partner with a Vietnamese partner who understands the culture, understands the system. They're going to be looking for young talent. And if you start a company that helps to identify talent and is then helping those who are doing business here to recruit, I'm sure that that will go very well.\nThis is not an area that I'm an expert on, but one of the things that we're seeing is, through organizations like—or companies like LinkedIn—I don't know if you've heard of that—based out of Silicon Valley. But they've been able to build these digital platforms where people are continually updating their résumés and providing their information. And that becomes a powerful tool then for human resource people who are recruiting. And it's conceivable that you could do something equivalent to that in Vietnam in preparation for the ongoing growth and development of businesses here in Vietnam.\nSo that's a great idea. Good luck.\nI—in terms of the question on entrepreneurship, I wasn't clear exactly what your question was. Was it that you think talented Vietnamese are going someplace else instead of staying here? Is that right?\nQ. How can Vietnamese firms and Government have policies to keep, to retain the talent?\nThe President. To retain talent.\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. So you're worried about a brain drain where——\nQ. Yes, brain drain, yes.\nThe President. ——where young Vietnamese, they get an education, and suddenly, they're being recruited to go to Australia or to go to Singapore or to go the United States or China, and then you don't have enough entrepreneurs here.\nWell, look, I think the best way to retain talent in any country is to make sure that talent is rewarded. And the way to reward talent is to have strong rule of law; to have a good education system; to have the ability to start a business relatively easily; to make sure that government policies, when it comes to taxation or when it comes to building infrastructure, that those policies are good ones, and so that people feel as if, by staying here, this is the best place for them to make it.\nPeople usually don't want to leave their home countries if they feel like they've got opportunity in their home countries. Usually, they end up leaving if they feel as if they're stuck in their home countries. And so one of the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is, it's going to lead to the Government taking a series of legal reforms that I actually think will create a better business environment. And it means for young talented people like you, there's no reason to leave because you're going to be in a position to do great things here in Vietnam. The places that, I think, lose talent where there's a lot of corruption—so no matter how hard you work, you always have to pay a bribe or you've got to hire somebody's cousin to get a license to do something—that ends up frustrating people. I think people feel frustrated if there's not a good education system, because the truth is, is that not only do you need a good education, but then if you want to start a business, you've got to be able to hire people who also have a good education. And so you've got to count on the schools training people properly. You want to have good infrastructure, proper roads, and you want to have proper wireless service in order for you to do business in the 21st century.\nEnvironmental issues are increasingly important. I mean, there are some countries where it's actually hard to recruit people because it's hard to breathe in some of the big cities. Now, you don't want to raise your kids—no job is so important that it's okay if your children have asthma and they can't breathe. Right? And so, interestingly enough, if you want the best talent today, you have to pay attention to quality-of-life issues and making sure that people can have clean air and clean water and they're not being exposed to pollution that may cause cancer and things like that.\nSo those are all policies that end up making a difference in retaining talent in any country, in any city, in any community.\nGood. All right. Okay, well, we've got these young ladies—well, they've got a flag. So since you brought a flag, that's a—I'm very impressed with your planning. [Laughter] Those of you with the hats, the flags, it's good organizing.\nHuman Trafficking/Trans-Pacific Partnership\nQ. Hi, my name is Christina, and I'm with my colleague Hoa and some of our other colleagues here. And we work for an American anti-human trafficking NGO called Pacific Links Foundation. So we fight against human trafficking here in Vietnam. With Vietnam emerging as an important player in the TPP, many companies will start to shift their production and factories to Vietnam, which will create a new mobile workforce. With that comes the unfortunate opportunity for human traffickers and labor brokers to take advantage of these workers, such as promising—like, creating false promises or tricking them or even coercing them into moving across borders and therefore forcing them into a situation of being trafficked. What is the United States Federal Government doing to prevent human trafficking in the global supply chain?\nThe President. Well, first of all, this is a——\nQ. Before you answer, can I ask you a question? Yes.\nThe President. I'm sorry, I didn't know——\nQ. Yes, because we come—we had the same comment——\nThe President. You're a tag team, I've got you.\nQ. Yes, yes. Okay. Thank you. So, dear President, what should I ask you for now? Because, before I came here—two, couple months, I asked many when I—whenever I met someone, I also asked what should—what do you want to ask if you can meet the President? And a lot of questions and a lot of comments. And for now, I forgot everything. But this flag is remind me about a Kenya friend—she's lawyer and very smart, and she said that—we see you, so you go meet, because she said that I say—should he come to Kenya—President, and she said I do. If you can ask, please, Obama about human trafficking prevention strategy. Thank you. Yes. The President. Okay. All right. Well, the—let me see. You lost my train of thought. [Laughter] No, look, the issue of human trafficking is something that we have made a top priority in our State Department and the United States Government. So we have an entire set of policies designed specifically to work with countries to prevent human trafficking. And we've actually begun making progress in improved enforcement, in improved law enforcement coordination. NGOs have been very helpful as partners with us in identifying what are some of the paths where people are being exploited.\nWith respect to TPP, it's precisely because we put such an emphasis on this that we actually have provisions in TPP designed to prevent human trafficking. And it's actually given us leverage to work with some countries to say, if you want to be part of TPP, you have to have a better system in place to prevent human trafficking, including some of these cross-border migrant worker situations.\nSo, when I was in Malaysia, for example, meeting with Prime Minister Najib, one of the most important topics as we were negotiating TPP was, how could we do more work in order to protect people who are being brought in—whether it's working at the palm oil plants or what have you—so that there was better tracking, better enforcement, better protections for people? And that's in the actual agreement.\nNow, I think that an agreement on paper is never enough, so there have to be systems in place to monitor what's taking place. And these human traffickers are very clever. They're like drug traffickers. If you cut off one path, then try to take another path, and they're always looking to exploit people who are desperate. So this is why this can't just be a government initiative or a law enforcement initiative. It has to be something where we're partnering with NGOs, human rights organizations. We have to be very nimble in how we adapt to changing circumstances so that we're constantly shutting down some of these pathways.\nHaving—the last thing I'll say, though, is one of the best ways for us to reduce human trafficking is to provide more opportunity for people, particularly in rural areas throughout Southeast Asia. And if we can give young people in villages a chance to make a living and get an education, and if we particularly focus on women and girls—because a lot of human trafficking results from the fact that girls are not given the same educational opportunities as boys, and as a consequence, they find themselves in very desperate situations—the more we can change those dynamics, that will also reduce the ability of people to exploit people who have no hope or think that they have to leave their village and are vulnerable then to claims that if you just come with us you're going to be able to get a great job and everything is going to be okay. And then, by the time they get there, they suddenly find themselves trapped in a very bad situation.\nSo congratulations on the good work you're doing. I'm very proud of you. Thank you.\nAll right, how much more time we got? We've only got time for one more question? All right, I'll take two more questions. But it's a guy's turn first. I'm going to call on this guy just because I kind of like the little—the yellow in his hair there. All right, I like the style. [Laughter] There you go.\nThe President's Childhood/U.S. Declaration of Independence\nQ. Hi, thank you. My name is—[inaudible]—and I'm a filmmaker, so I'm very interested in personal stories. And as you said before, when you are young, you're like—love fooling around. And I read on Internet—I'm not sure if true or not—that you also like smoking weed and things like that. [Laughter] So I wonder—— The President. I don't know if that's true, but—[laughter].\nQ. I wonder what makes you from that guy, become a guy who care about the society. Because, like, a lot of places, many—I think many young Vietnamese people, they still love, like fooling around——\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. ——and they don't really care about the society. But this must be something that makes you become this person. So thank you.\nThe President. Well, it's a good question. I wrote a book about this called, \"Dreams From My Father.\" I think it was translated into Vietnamese, but I don't know if it's still in bookstores near you. You know, you never know exactly why something inside you clicks and you decide to take a different path.\nI think, for me, when I was young—because my—I didn't know my father, and I didn't grow up with him in the house—my grandmother's—or my grandparents and my mother raised me. And they were very loving and very generous. But I think I rebelled in part because I felt that something was missing. And as I got older, I realized that instead of worrying about the father who wasn't there, I should worry more about what can I do and take more responsibility for my own life.\nAnd that led me to start studying more, and it led me to start thinking about social issues more. I grew up. And why it took me until I was 19 or 20, where some other people like many of you have always been very organized—like this young lady, I'll bet she's always been, like, very focused—you don't know why.\nAnd—but I think your point about stories is good. One of the things that I've learned about being a leader is, sometimes, we think people are motivated only by money or they're only motivated by power or these very concrete incentives.\nBut people are also inspired by stories. The stories they tell themselves about what's important and about their lives and about their country and about their communities. And I think if you want to—in whatever field you're in, whether it's business or politics or nonprofit work, it's worthwhile to listen to other people and ask them questions about the stories that are important to them, because oftentimes, you'll find their motivations. And when we come together to do important things, it's usually because we've told a good story about why we should be working together.\nYou think about the United States of America. We have a really good story called the Declaration of Independence. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that we're endowed with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" That's a wonderful story. There's no—when the Declaration was made, there really was no United States. It was just a good story that they were telling about what could be. And then, people were attracted to that story. And it led to independence, and it led to immigrants from around the world who wanted that vision for themselves. It led Ho Chi Minh to adapt it when Vietnam was trying to declare independence. It inspired movements around the world.\nSo yes, the stories we tell each other are very, very important. And good luck on making your movies. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet though. [Laughter] Okay, last question. All right, oh, this young lady, she stood up, and she's, like, \"hey!\" I couldn't say no to her. She had her hand up. I thought she was going to hit me if I didn't call on her. [Laughter] Go ahead. I'm teasing.\nImportance of the Arts/Freedom of Expression\nMusician Hàng Lâm Trang \"Suboi\" Anh. Hi. So I am a rapper here——\nThe President. Oh, you're a rapper?\nSuboi. ——in Saigon, Vietnam.\nThe President. Oh, yes?\nSuboi. So you have spoken a lot about environment and, like, politics and economic progress of Vietnam. But as an artist, we have a lot to say.\nThe President. Okay.\nSuboi. We have a message to send. I want to know how important it is for a nation to really help and promote their art and culture, and help it—to help its nation in the future.\nThe President. Okay. The—before I answer your question, why don't you give me a little rap? Let's see. Let's what you've got. Come on. Do you need like a little beat? Badoom, badoom. [Laughter]\nSuboi. Yes, I do, actually. [Laughter]\nThe President. No, no, go ahead. Come on.\nSuboi. Vietnamese or English?\nThe President. In Vietnamese, of course.\nSuboi. In Vietnamese?\nThe President. I mean, I—the—I won't know what it means, but——\nQ. Okay.\nThe President. ——just a short version, because I've got to get going. Go ahead. [Laughter]\n[At this point, Suboi performed a rap in Vietnamese, and no translation was provided.]\nSuboi. My name is Suboi, by the way.\nThe President. Well, that was good. See there, that was pretty good. What were you just rapping? What was your verse there?\nSuboi. I was just talking about some people having a lot of money, having big houses, but actually, are they really happy?\nThe President. Hmm. Okay.\nSuboi. So, yes, a lot of things that people look at us and see, like, different things and something they assume, or a lot of, like, stereotypes, like, you know, like, me, a Asian rapper, it's like looking at a cute girl. People don't know——\nThe President. Is that what they think? [Laughter] Suboi. But for Vietnamese people, it's different. They think rapping is not, like, for women.\nThe President. Ahh. Well, that's true in the United States too. [Laughter] No, no, what—I just mean that there's always been sort of sexism and gender stereotypes in the music industry like every other part of life.\nBut to answer your question, look, the arts are important. Artistic expression is important. It's what I was just saying to the filmmaker about stories that we tell each other. Music, poetry, representations of life as it is and how it should be—those are the things that inspire people. Life is a combination of very practical things. Right? You've got to eat, you've got to work, you've got to build roads and make sure that the—some dam isn't ruining a community. But it's also the spirit that we have inside of us and how is that expressed and what are our vision and what are our ideals for the future and how do we want to live together and how do we treat each other.\nAnd one of the most important things about art is, it teaches you to not just think about yourself, but it puts you in the head of other people. So you start realizing somebody else's pain or somebody else's hopes. And you start realizing that we have more in common. So if I read a novel by somebody in Africa, now, suddenly, I understand more about how we are similar. And if I listen to a Vietnamese rap, and it connects to the things that I'm feeling, now I feel closer to a country on the other side of the world. And that's how we build understanding. And that's how we end up being able to work together and plan together and build a better future together.\nSo look, let's be honest. Sometimes, art is dangerous though. And that's why governments sometimes get nervous about art. But one of the things that I truly believe is that if you try to suppress the arts, then I think you're suppressing the deepest dreams and aspirations of a people.\nAnd one of the great things about the United States, for all of our flaws in a lot of areas is, is that we do give much greater expression to our culture. And something like rap, which started off as an expression of poor African Americans, now, suddenly has become a global phenomenon and is really the art form of most young people around the world today in a lot of ways. And imagine if, at the time when rap was starting off, that our Government had said, no, because some of the things you say are offensive, or some of the lyrics are rude, or you're cursing too much. Then, that connection that we've seen now in hip-hop culture around the world wouldn't exist.\nSo you've got to let people express themselves. That's part of what a modern, 21st-century culture is all about.\nAll right, everybody. I'm—I've got to go, but this has been wonderful. Thank you so much. God bless you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-05-25", "title": "Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative Town Hall Meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at approximately 10:50 p.m. in the Fujii Room at the Shima Kanko Hotel, The Classic.

Prime Minister Abe and a reporter spoke in Japanese, and their remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117684", "text": "Prime Minister Abe. At the very outset of our small-group discussion, I firmly lodged a protest against President Obama as the Japanese Prime Minister with regard to the most recent case in Okinawa. The entire time for the small group discussion was spent on this specific case in Okinawa. And I feel profound resentment against this self-centered and absolutely despicable crime.\nThis case has shocked not only Okinawa, but also deeply shocked the entire Japan. I conveyed to the President that such feelings of Japanese people should be sincerely taken to heart. I also urged the United States to make sure to take effective and thorough means to prevent a recurrence and vigorously and strictly address the situation.\nIn proceeding with the realignment of the U.S. forces without truly staying together with the feelings of the people in Okinawa, we will not be able to make progress. And there is a tough and challenging road ahead of us as we seek to regain confidence, which was lost due to the most recent case. However, we both agreed to do our utmost in areas such as impact mitigation in Okinawa through Japan-U.S. cooperation.\nAt the plenary meeting, for myself, I conveyed to the President that I wholeheartedly welcome the decision by President Obama to visit Hiroshima, a place which suffered an atomic bomb. And he is going to visit the Hiroshima as the first-ever U.S. President.\nI am convinced that when the leader of a nation that is the only nation to have used a nuclear weapon and the leader of the nation that is the nation—only nation to have suffered atomic bombings in the war express the feelings of sincere sorrow and pray for the repose of the souls of those citizens who sacrificed their life will create a significant and strong momentum toward the world free of nuclear weapons.\nJapan and the United States, together, working hand in hand and continuously doing utmost for global peace and prosperity, I would like to send such a powerful message from Hiroshima together with President Obama.\nSo tomorrow, finally, the G-7 Ise-Shima summit is starting. We could compare notes how we, the G-7, can lead the world in addressing various challenges of the international community, including the global economy, which has become increasingly uncertain, and also the challenges against the international order.\nIn particular, the global economy is going to be the biggest theme for the G-7 Ise-Shima summit. And both President Obama and I could share the recognition that G-7 should lead the global sustainable and powerful growth. My determination is to demonstrate in a thorough manner a way forward toward resolving various challenges of the international community, through the close cooperation between Japan and the United States.\nJapan and the United States, working hand in hand for regional and global peace and prosperity, based on our enduring bond and also under our alliance of hope, that is the determination that I could renew, together with President Obama today.\n[At this point, the moderator spoke in English as follows.] Moderator. Now, let me invite the President of the United States.\nPresident Obama. Well, I want to thank Prime Minister Abe and the people of Japan for welcoming us. Prime Minister Abe and his team have done an outstanding job preparing for the G-7 summit. And we discussed, as Shinzo indicated, the need for us to continue to boost global growth and to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nThe alliance between the United States and Japan is a critical foundation for the security of both of our countries. That alliance has also helped to fortify peace and security throughout the region.\nAs Prime Minister Abe indicated, we did discuss the tragedy that took place in Okinawa, and I extended my sincerest condolences and deepest regrets. And the United States will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation to ensure that justice is done under the Japanese legal system.\nWe also discussed a range of regional issues, and given the threat from North Korea, we agreed to continue reinforcing deterrence and strengthening our defense capabilities. On maritime issues, we are united in upholding freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes.\nWe also discussed a range of global issues, including the need for additional resources to help migrants and refugees and to support Iraq. And we discussed the role our countries should play in achieving the early entry into force of the Paris climate change agreement.\nFinally, I'm looking forward to the opportunity to visit with some of our American and Japanese military personnel to thank them for their service. And our visit to Hiroshima will honor all those who were lost in World War II and reaffirm our shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons, as well as highlight the extraordinary alliance that we have been able to forge over these many decades.\n[The moderator spoke in English as follows.]\nModerator. Thank you. Thank you, the President. Now, let us have the questions from the floor. I would have two questions, one from Japanese side, the other one from the United—you Americans' side. The—let me appoint the questioner, and then let me defer to my American counterpart to appoint the U.S. question. And when the—we appointed, please make sure that you are—the names and media outlet. And—[inaudible]—question.\n[He then spoke in Japanese, but no translation was provided.]\nQ. This is—[inaudible]—from NHK. I would like to ask a question to Prime Minister Abe with regard to the most recent, very tragic case in Okinawa. I understand that more than 20 years have already passed since the rape incident, which involved U.S. Marine Corps officers back in 1995. But even so, we do not see the decreasing number of crimes involving the U.S. people. And it is quite regrettable a trend. And whenever Japan faces each of the case or accident, I understand that the Japanese Government has been requesting the U.S. side to take measures to prevent the recurrence of the—such measures. And also, you have been dealing with the situation through the improvement of the implementation of the SOFA instead of having amendment to the SOFA itself. And I am aware of the fact that your judicial systems are quite different of—between Japan and the United States.\nSo my question to the Prime Minister is that whether or not you have requested to the President that we should have the revision or amendment to the SOFA. And also, in order for you to see the progress in the base-related issues, I understand that the key is to regain the confidence among the people in Okinawa, as well as ensuring safety and security among those of the people in Okinawa. So what specific measures are you planning to implement as you move forward?\nPrime Minister Abe. I too feel profound resentment. When thinking of fear and real disappointment of this victim, I am just speechless. We will investigate in a vigorous manner under the Japanese jurisdiction, in mind with the Japanese laws, this offender who committed this self-centered and absolutely despicable crime.\nWith regard to the Japanese investigation process, during our discussion, President Obama assured me that the U.S. side will offer full support as we move forward. The entire Japan was deeply shocked due to this most recent case. And as I said earlier, for myself, I conveyed to the President that such feelings of the Japanese people should be taken to heart sincerely. I also requested that the United States vigorously and strictly address the situation, including making sure to take effective and thorough measures to prevent recurrence.\nOn the status of forces agreement, when facing issues, we will steadily realize the visible improvement in concrete terms as for each and every issue that we face. And by doing so, we will achieve results, one after another, in a steady manner, in parallel with such steady efforts. My view is that we both make efforts and persistently pursue the most appropriate form of the regime, based on the status of forces agreement and related arrangements.\nAs a result of the case in Okinawa, people in Okinawa feel strong sense of uneasiness in light of their security situation. My intention is to thoroughly implement measures to prevent crimes and ensure safety and peace of mind among the people in Okinawa. So I already gave the instruction to my Chief Cabinet Secretary to consider such measures in a timely manner.\nSecuring lives and property of the Japanese people is my responsibility as Prime Minister. I am determined to take every possible means so that such tragic case is never to be repeated.\nWhite House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric H. Schultz. Christi Parsons with the Chicago Tribune.\nAlleged Rape and Murder Committed by Former U.S. Servicemember in Okinawa, Japan/U.S. Diplomacy/Use of Military Force/China-U.S. Relations/South China Sea Maritime Disputes\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, on this trip you are confronting old war zones and the use of American military might in them. This week, you also crossed into sovereign Pakistani territory, where you did not have permission to operate, in order to kill the leader of the Taliban. After expanding the use of the drone program as you have, are you worried at all about handing it over to the next President? Could I also ask what your response is to the Chinese warnings this week that the U.S. and its partners in this region may be creating a tinderbox that would lead to regional conflict?\nMr. Prime Minister, if you would also reflect on that, I would appreciate it. Could you also tell us a little bit about what you think the President's visit to Hiroshima means to the Japanese people? And will you also consider a trip to Pearl Harbor, sir? Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Before I answer your questions, Christi, let me just touch on the points that were made earlier about the Okinawa case, because this has shaken up, I think, people in Okinawa as well as people throughout Japan. I want to emphasize that the United States is appalled by any violent crime that may have occurred or been carried out by any U.S. personnel or U.S. contractors. We consider it inexcusable. And we are committed to doing everything that we can to prevent any crimes from taking place of this sort. And that involves reviewing procedures and making sure that everything that can be done to prevent such occurrences from happening again are put into place.\nI think it's important to point out that the SOFA—the status of forces agreement—does not in any way prevent the full prosecution and the need for justice under the Japanese legal system. And we will be fully cooperating with the Japanese legal system in prosecuting this individual and making sure that justice is served. And we want to see a crime like this prosecuted here the same way that we would feel horrified and want to provide a sense of justice to a victim's family back in the United States.\nSo I think the Japanese people should know how deeply moved we are by what has happened and our intention to make sure that we're working with the Japanese Government to not only prosecute this crime, but to prevent crimes like this from happening again. Go ahead.\n[The interpreter translated President Obama's remarks into Japanese. He continued his remarks as follows.]\nChristi, with respect to your broader question, I wasn't entirely clear on the parallel you were trying to draw. As Commander in Chief and President of the United States, my job is to protect the American people. I wish that never involves us having to take military actions. That's not the world we live in.\nObviously, there are very few parallels between the deployment of 500,000 troops to Vietnam and us taking strikes against terrorists who are trying to kill our troops who are stationed in Afghanistan or potentially carry out actions in the homeland.\nBut I think that what might be a useful lesson to draw from the trip that I just took to Afghanistan—or to Vietnam, rather, is the extraordinary opportunities that have presented themselves through the diplomacy that we've been engaged in over the last 7 years, and the fact that former adversaries are now working in partnership to provide economic opportunities to both of our peoples, to expand trade and commerce, to educate those remarkable young people that were in the town halls that we met today. And I am investing enormous amounts of time and energy and resources into those kinds of diplomatic initiatives because, to the extent that they're successful, that shrinks areas of conflict, reduces the necessity of engaging in military action.\nBut at the end of the day, it is still going to be a dangerous world, and there are going to still be times where our U.S. fighting forces have to be deployed or have to take actions. And we have to do so in a way that is prudent, that is proportional, and that is mindful of the fact that any kinetic action, no matter how targeted and how justified, also can create tragedy. And one of the things that I hope to reflect on when I'm at Hiroshima—and certainly, something I reflected on when I was in Vietnam—is just a reminder that war involves suffering, and we should always do what we can to prevent it.\nBut, as I said early on in my Presidency when I was in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize, I am the President of a nation that at times is threatened by very real risks, not imaginary risks, and it's important for us to act on occasion in order to make sure that the American people are protected. [President Obama paused while his remarks were translated into Japanese. He continued his remarks as follows.]\nMy answer sounds so much longer in translation. [Laughter] So the—just very briefly, on China. Our growing partnership with Vietnam is happening entirely independent from China and is based on mutual interests to expand trade, to expand cooperation across a whole range of areas, and is 30 years in the making now. So the fact that China would perceive that as some sort of provocation to them, I think, says more about Chinese attitudes than it says anything about our attitudes.\nThe tensions between China and Vietnam or China and the Philippines or China and other claimants in the South China Sea are not of our making. And we would very much like to see a peaceful resolution of those disputes. What's preventing that from happening is not anything we're doing. We would welcome China and Vietnam having a conversation and being able to resolve those disputes. We're not taking a position on those claims. So it's entirely within China's power to resolve those disputes. And our goal with respect to our own interests in the South China Sea is simply to maintain freedom of navigation, freedom of overflight, and the maintenance of international rules and norms because we think that benefits everybody, including China.\nPrime Minister Abe. With regard to China, we certainly welcome the peaceful rise of China. And what we have been advocating for vis-à-vis the situation in this region is as follows, namely, three-pronged principles. First, if you are to make a claim you have to make a claim based on international law. And also, second, you should never intimidate others through the use of force or coercion, or you should not unilaterally change the status quo. And third, you should settle the disputes in a peaceful manner in accordance with international law.\nWith regard to President Obama's visit to Hiroshima, I'd like to touch on this. Seventy-one years ago, back in 1945, two atomic bombs were dropped. And in Hiroshima, numerous number—numerous citizens sacrificed their lives, and even now there are those of us suffering because of the atomic bombing. And what those Japanese people's suffering from the atomic bomb desiring is never to repeat such tragedy in the world. And I understand that the upcoming visit by President Obama to Hiroshima will no doubt create further powerful momentum toward realizing a world free of nuclear weapons.\nAt this moment, I don't have any specific plan to visit Hawaii. However, last year, when we marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, I made an official visit to the United States. During my visit to the United States last year, I had an opportunity to deliver a speech to the joint Houses of the U.S. Congress. And on that occasion, I sincerely reflected on the past and expressed my sincere sense, and also, I highlighted the facts that former adversaries are now transforming into the relationship of allies, as the United States and Japan—as we stand at this moment. And also, during my visit to the United States, I had a chance to visit the Second World War Memorial, where I laid a wreath to pray for the souls of the—all the war dead.\nSo as we move forward, I am determined to work closely with the United States in addressing various challenges of the international community based on our robust alliance, namely the alliance of hope between Japan and the United States. Thank you.\nModerator. Now, let us wrap up the joint conference.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118148", "text": "At the heart of the American story is the simple truth that all children should have a fair chance at success, no matter who they are or where they come from. Central to this promise of opportunity is the love and support of a family - which all children deserve, but not enough have.\nOn any given day, there are over 400,000 children in our nation's foster care system with over 100,000 waiting to be adopted. Every year, 23,000 of these youth will age out of the system never having found a permanent home. Young people who age out of foster care face a tough road: they are more likely to experience significant challenges with completing their education, obtaining a job, homelessness, maintaining financial security and staying out of the criminal justice system. A significant percentage of former foster youth suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. We also know that there continues to be a disproportionate representation of African-American and Native-American children and youth in foster care. The President believes that no child should have to beat the odds simply to get a good education, to live a productive life free from abuse and neglect and to pursue their dreams. And they certainly should not feel alone as they try.\nAdvances in technology have radically changed nearly every aspect of our lives—but for too many aspects of the foster care system, we're stuck in the last century. President Obama believes that with enhanced commitment and coordination, the technology and child welfare sectors can work together to solve some of our most pressing issues.\nToday, as a step to improve the lives of youth and families in the foster care system, to prevent more young people from entering the system, and to create better outcomes for those who age out, the White House, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Think of Us are hosting the first ever White House foster care and technology hackathon. This two-day long event during  National Foster Care Month brings together child welfare leaders, non-profit organizations, philanthropies, attorneys and foster care families and alumni, as well as engineers, technologists and other leaders from the technology sector. At the convening, we will discuss ways to improve our foster care system through the use of technology and highlight best practices. Additionally, those involved with child welfare will have the opportunity to team up with technology experts to \"hack\" challenges in child welfare and explore 21st century solutions. Such challenges include:\n• Actively integrating more innovative technology into child welfare agencies;\n• Preventing homelessness for youth who have aged out of care;\n• Making essential documents readily available to foster youth;\n• Helping mothers dealing with substance abuse;\n• Getting more families to sign up to be foster homes;\n• Empowering foster youth with decision making abilities;\n• Creating a frameworks to protect child welfare information in the digital age and;\n• Preventing unplanned pregnancy among foster youth.\nThe Administration and its partners are also proud to announce a number of new steps aimed to increase the use of technology and improve outcomes in the foster care system. Today's announcements include:\n• Comprehensive Child Welfare Information Systems (CCWIS) Final Rule: For the first time in 23 years, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued new regulations that guide the use of technology in child welfare. The CCWIS regulations promote innovation and allow state and county child welfare agencies to use more effective technology to quickly identify youth and family needs and link them to services. Additionally, the regulations promote the exchange of information between child welfare agencies, health care facilities, education systems and courts to better serve young people in and aging out of care.\n• U.S. Department of Health and Human Services New Partnership to Build Technology Systems: The HHS Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) has recently teamed up with the General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies to provide $1 million worth of consulting services to states as they procure agile child welfare data systems. Through this new partnership, GSA will provide in-depth training and assistance on modular procurements, user-centered design, agile development, application programming interfaces and open source technologies for child welfare agencies across the country.\n• U.S. Department of Education Foster Care Transition Toolkit: The U.S. Department of Education released a comprehensive toolkit for foster youth transitioning out of care that highlights ways to successfully pursue higher education and careers post high school. The toolkit includes tips and resources intended to help foster youth access and navigate social, emotional, educational, skills and resource barriers as they transition into adulthood. This toolkit is also intended to serve as a resource to caseworkers, caregivers, teachers and mentors helping foster youth to realize their highest aspirations. The Foster Care Transition Toolkit was designed in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Labor and incorporates input from practitioners and current and former foster youth.\n• U.S. Department of Labor Get My Future App: The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Employment and Training Administration has launched GetMyFuture.org, a mobile-friendly webapp within the Career One Stop website (an informational website sponsored by DOL) for youth to plan careers, explore education and training options and search and apply for jobs. Developed with input from young adults and youth program providers, Get My Future provides youth with online tools, information and resources to help them gain employment success. The site features a streamlined interest assessment and occupational profile to help young people see what careers are a good fit for them along with wage information, skill and education requirements and an indicator of whether or not there will be jobs available in that sector. It also provides special resources to help young people meet challenges such as involvement in the foster care and juvenile justice systems, homelessness, addiction, or a lack of financial, family, or community resources.\n• Free Laptops for Transition Age Foster Youth in California: Research released today reveals a marked digital divide for foster youth. Led by the Walter S. Johnson Foundation and Foster Care Counts, a public/private coalition led by the State of California has been created to address this digital divide. They have committed $250,000 to launch an effort to ensure that all transition age foster youth in California are provided laptop computers. Having secured the support of the California Department of Social Services and the Child Welfare Directors' Association of California, the coalition aims to distribute 10,000 laptops to foster youth ages 16-21 at an estimated cost of $5m over the next three years.\n• Pritzker Foster Care Initiative's New Foster Care Technology Innovation Fund: Today, the Pritzker Foster Care Initiative announced the launch of a $1 million Foster Care Technology Innovation Fund to boost non-profit entrepreneurial efforts targeted to supporting transition age youth 18-24 years of age in the foster care system. The Fund builds upon the foundation's commitment to encourage the development of technology applications to ensure that foster youth have broader access to services, information and higher quality care. Grants will be made to non-profit organizations which are developing innovative online solutions and mobile apps that meet the unique needs of youth in foster care. The Fund will encourage public-private partners to boost tech investment in child welfare.\n• Modern Day Case Management System Prototype from Salesforce: Salesforce, a customer relationship management development firm, will create a prototype within 90 days to model a modern day case management system scalable by interested foster care service providers. Salesforce will make the prototype and code that runs on Salesforce available to interested stakeholders.\nTo watch this event live, visit www.whitehouse.gov/live on May 26, 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM ET and May 27, 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM ET.", "timestamp": "2016-05-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: First Ever White House Foster Care & Technology Hackathon"}

It is beyond an honor and a pleasure to be with you all today.\nOf course, I want to start by thanking Hanna and Michael for their wonderful introduction. And I want to recognize all of the other outstanding student leaders who have graced us with their words today. I'm so proud of you all.\nI also want to thank the governors, the tribal leaders, elders, the board of trustees, along with the superintendent and your amazing principal, your teachers and staff. I wish I could meet you all, I wish I could spend a whole week with you. (Applause.) I also want to thank the Tewa dancers who performed for us today -- absolutely. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, last but not least, to the class of 2016: You all did it! Woo! You're here! You did it! You made it! (Applause.)

You're here. You made it. And we are all so very, very proud of you. I love you all so much.\nAnd today, I want just to take a moment once again to look around this beautiful auditorium at the people who helped you on your journey -– your families and friends, everyone in your school and your communities –- all the people who pushed you and poured their love into you and believed in you even when you didn't believe in yourselves sometimes. Today is their day, too, right? So let's, graduates, give them big, old, loud shout-out and love to our families. Thank you all. (Applause.) Yes!\nAnd that's actually where I want to start today –- with family, in particular with my own family. I want to tell you about the people who came before me and how they made me who I am today.\nI am the great-great-granddaughter of Jim Robinson, who was born in South Carolina, lived as a slave, and is likely buried in an unmarked grave on the plantation where he worked. I am the great-granddaughter of Fraser Robinson, an illiterate houseboy who taught himself to read and became an entrepreneur, selling newspapers and shoes. I am the granddaughter of Fraser Robinson Jr., who left the only life he'd ever known to move his family north, seeking a place where his children's dreams wouldn't be so limited by the color of their skin.\nAnd I am the daughter of Fraser Robinson III and Marian Robinson, who raised me and my brother in a tiny apartment on the South Side of Chicago, just upstairs from my elderly great aunt and uncle, who my parents cared for, and just blocks away from our extended family –- a host of grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins who were always in and out of each other's homes and lives, sharing stories and food and talking and laughing for hours.\nAnd while my parents were products of segregated schools, and neither of them had an education past high school, they knew with every bone in their bodies that they wanted their kids to go to college. That was their mission from the day we were born. So my mother volunteered at our school so that she could make sure we were taking our studies seriously. And my father worked as a pump operator at the city water plant, saving every penny for our college tuition. And when my father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis –- a disease that affected his muscles and made it hard for him to walk and even dress himself in the morning –- I remember he hardly ever missed a day of work, no matter how sick he was, no matter how much pain he was in.\nAnd let me tell you, I will never forget the look of pride on his face and on my mom's face as I walked across the stage at Princeton University, and three years later at Harvard Law School to accept my diplomas –- degrees that have given me opportunities that my parents never could have dreamed of for themselves.\nSo, graduates, this is my story. And I'm sharing this with you because when I heard that -- when you were first brainstorming about who to invite to your commencement and someone suggested me or my husband, some of you thought that that was an impossible dream, that it just wasn't realistic to think that people like us would ever visit a school like yours. Well, today, I want you to know that there is nowhere I would rather be than right here with all of you. (Applause.)\nBecause while I might have grown up across the country, and while my journey may be a bit different than yours, when I learned about all of you, it was clear to me that our stories are connected, and that your values -– the values that infuse this school –- are the very same values that my parents handed down to me.\nSee, I learned respect from how my parents cared for my great aunt and uncle –- how my mother would wake up in the middle of the night to check on my great aunt, how my father would prop himself up against the bathroom sink each morning, leaning hard on his crutches, to give my great uncle a shave. I learned integrity from my parents –- that living a good life is not about being wealthy or powerful, it's about being honest and doing what you say you're going to do. It's about how you act when no one is watching, and whether you're the same person on the outside as you are on the inside.\nMy parents -- yes. (Applause.) My parents also taught me about giving back –- that when someone is sick, you show up, maybe with a home-cooked meal; when someone's down on their luck, you quietly slip them whatever's in your wallet, even if you're not doing so well yourself.\nAnd finally, my parents –- especially my dad -– taught me about perseverance. See, my dad had been an athlete his whole life, a swimmer and a boxer. But if he was frustrated or disappointed by his illness, he never let on. He just woke up extra early each day, slowly fastened each button on his uniform, and eased himself down the steps one leg at a time, to get to his job and provide for our family.\nSo, graduates, I wanted to be here with you at your commencement because your values are my values –- the values that carried me all the way from the South Side of Chicago to where I am today, standing before you as the First Lady of the United States. (Applause.) I also wanted to be here because your stories -- your achievements, your contributions and the story of this school -- inspire me.\nAs we all know, this school was founded as part of a deliberate, systematic effort to extinguish your culture; to literally annihilate who you were and what you believed in. But look at you today. The Native languages that were once strictly forbidden here now echo through hallways and in your dorm room conversations at night. (Applause.) The traditions that this school was designed to destroy are now expressed in every square foot of this building –- in the art on your walls, in the statue in your MSC building, in the Po Pay Day song and dance performances in your plaza, in the prayers and blessings that you offer in your heart room.\nAnd the endless military drills and manual labor that those early students endured have been replaced by one of the best academic curriculums in the country. (Applause.) And over the years, you all have proudly represented this school in chess tournaments, and science and robotics competitions, and every kind of internship and leadership conference imaginable. And nearly all of you are going on to college. And as the superintendent said, you've earned more than $5 million in scholarships this year. That is breathtaking -- breathtaking. (Applause.)\nAnd whether you're saying an ancient blessing over your hydroponically-grown crops, or using cutting-edge computer technology to understand the biology and hydrology of your ancestral lands, every day at this school, you've been weaving together thousands of years of your heritage with the realities of your modern lives. And all of that preparation and hard work, graduates, is so critically important, because make no mistake about it, you all are the next generation of leaders in your communities, and not years from now or decades from now, but right now.\nThrough your senior honors projects, you've already become experts on urgent issues like addiction and poverty, education and economic development. And so many of you have already stepped up to implement your projects in your communities, hosting a fun run to raise awareness about domestic violence and diabetes, leading a traditional foods cooking demonstration, supporting seniors and teen parents, and doing so much more.\nAnd as you begin the next phase of your journey, please remember that your communities need even more of your energy and expertise. They need you to bring home additional knowledge and skills to more effective address the challenges your communities face. That's why it is so important for all of you to hold fast to your goals, and to push through any obstacles that may come your way.\nAnd here's the thing: I guarantee you that there will be obstacles -- plenty of them. For example, when you get to college or wherever else you're going next, it's going to be an adjustment. College was certainly a huge adjustment for me. I had never lived away from home, away from my family for any length of time. So there were times when I felt lonely and overwhelmed during my freshman year.\nAnd what I want you to remember is if that happens to you, I want you to keep pushing forward. Just keep pushing forward. And I want you to reach out and ask for help. I know your teachers tell you that all the time, but please understand that no one gets through college -- or life, for that matter -- alone. No one. I certainly didn't.\nSo the minute you feel like you're struggling -- the minute -- I want you to ask for help. Don't wait. Seek out a professor you trust. Go to the writing center or the counseling center. Talk to older students who know the ropes and can give you some advice. And if the first person you ask isn't friendly or helpful, then ask a second person, and then a third and a fourth. My point is, keep asking until you get the answers you need to get you back on track. Do you understand me? (Applause.)\nI am so passionate about this because your communities need you. They need you to develop your potential and become who you're meant to be. And that goes for every student in here who is thinking about dropping out, who is feeling discouraged. Your community needs you. And more than ever before, our world needs you, too.\nAnd you don't need your First Lady to tell you that. All you have to do is tune in to the news and you'll see that right now, some of the loudest voices in our national conversation are saying things that go against every single one of the values that you've been living at this school. (Applause.) They're telling us that we should disrespect others because of who they are or where they come from or how they worship. They're telling us that we should be selfish –- that folks who are struggling don't deserve our help, that we should just take what we can from life and not worry about anyone else. And they're saying that it's okay to keep harming our planet and using our land, our air, our water however we wish.\nBut, graduates, you all know that those are not the values that shape good citizens. Those are not the values that build strong families and communities and nations. You know this. So we desperately need your voices and your values in this conversation reminding us that we're all connected, we're all obligated to treat one another with respect, to act with integrity, to give back to those in need.\nNow, I know that perhaps I'm asking a lot of all of you. And I know that sometimes all those obligations might feel like a heavy burden. I also know that many of you have already faced and overcome challenges in your lives that most young people can't even begin to imagine -- challenges that have tested your courage, your confidence, your faith, and your trust.\nBut, graduates, those struggles should never be a source of shame -- never -- and they are certainly not a sign of weakness. Just the opposite. Those struggles are the source of your greatest strengths. Because by facing adversity head on and getting through it, you have gained wisdom and maturity beyond your years. I've seen it in you. You've developed resilience that will sustain you throughout your lives. You've deepened a well of compassion within yourselves that will help you connect with and give back to others who struggle.\nAnd most of all, you have taken your place in the long line of those before you whose continued survival in the face of overwhelming threats should inspire you every day of your lives -- every day. I'm talking about many of your ancestors who came together to lead a revolt, risking their lives to preserve their traditions. I'm talking about your predecessors at this school who defied the rules by speaking their languages and running away to attend ceremonial dances back home. And I'm talking about the leaders who reclaimed and reopened this school for you, rebuilding it in your image and the image of your communities. (Applause.)\nGraduates, all of these people, and so many more, have worked so hard and sacrificed so much so that you could be sitting in these seats on this glorious day celebrating your graduation. And as we honor their legacy today, I'm reminded of how some of your communities have seeds that your ancestors have been planting and harvesting for thousands of years, long before America was even an idea. (Applause.)\nAnd just as they have been blessing those crops and lovingly preserving those seeds through storms and droughts, struggles and upheavals so that they could keep handing them down, generation after generation, so, too, have they handed down their wisdom, and their values and their dreams, fighting to save them in the face of unthinkable odds, spurred on by their devotion to those who came before them and those who would come after.\nAnd, graduates, today, all of that -- all of that -- lives inside of you. All of that history, all of that sacrifice, all of that love lives within you. And you all should feel so proud and so blessed to have the privilege of continuing that story. Because with the education you've gotten from this amazing school and with the values that you've learned from your families and your communities, your big, impossible dreams are actually just the right size -- big. And you have everything you need to achieve them.\nNow, of course, it won't be easy. But standing here today with all of you, I am filled with hope. It's the same hope I feel when I think about my own story –- how my great-great grandfather was another man's property, my great-grandfather was another man's servant, my grandparents and parents felt the sting of segregation and discrimination. But because they refused to be defined by anyone else's idea of who they were and what they could be, because they held fast to their impossible dreams for themselves and their children, today, my two daughters wake up each morning in the White House. (Applause.)\nAnd every day, I try my best to pass down to my girls that same love and that same dreaming spirit that Marian and Fraser Robinson passed down to me, that same love and spirit that your ancestors passed down to all of you and that you will soon pass on to your children and grandchildren.\nBecause in the end, I believe that that is the true path of history in this country. It is long -- it is. (Applause.) It is long. It is winding. And at times it can be very painful. But ultimately, it flows in the direction of hope, dignity and justice, because people like you stand up for your values -- people like you who stay true to who you are and where you've come from, and who work every day to share the blessings you've had with others.\nSo, graduates, in closing, I hope that you will always remember your story, and that you will carry your story with you as proudly as I carry mine. I am so proud of you. I am so excited for you to continue this extraordinary journey. And I can't wait to see everything you'll achieve and bring back to your communities.\nThank you all. Love you.

So, as all of you know, we're going to Hiroshima tomorrow. And in the interest of getting you all home at a reasonable hour, we're not going to be doing a press conference after, so I thought I'd give you guys a chance to fire off some questions now.\nJust a quick comment on the G-7 meeting so far: It's been extremely productive. I think that one of the benefits of the G-7 is you have likeminded countries who are committed to democracy and free markets and international law and international norms. And so for us to be able to get together and focus on critical issues that not only affect individual countries, but affect the international order, I think is vitally important. And we very much appreciate the work that the Japanese and Prime Minister Abe have done in organizing an excellent meeting.\nSo far, we've discussed issues of the global economy and the need to continue to accelerate growth, to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that we're not only putting people back to work, but also helping to lift wages and helping to make sure that we can sustain the momentum of the recovery that's taking place in the United States most prominently, but also we're starting to see some progress in Europe. The fact that the Greek debt crisis has been resolved for a reasonable length of time, I think, should help. But we've all got a lot of work to do. And we agreed to continue to focus on making sure that each country, based on its particular needs and capacities, are taking steps to accelerate growth.\nWe had a chance to talk about trade—not only TPP and our involvement in that, but also T-TIP—and recommitted ourselves to making sure that we try to finish those negotiations before the end of the year and emphasized the importance of pushing back against either protectionism or competitive currency devaluations or the kinds of beggar-thy-neighbor strategies that all too often end up leaving everybody worse off.\nWe began to touch on some of the key security issues that are important to all of us: South China Sea and maritime security; touched on issues surrounding Ukraine, where we've started to see some progress in negotiations, but we're still seeing too much violence, and we need to get that resolved. And we're going to spend some time this evening tackling some of the other major international hotspots.\nSo that gives you an update of where we're at so far. And with that, I'm just going to dive in, and you guys can ask some questions. And we're going to start with Gardiner [Gardiner Harris, New York Times].\nNuclear Nonproliferation Efforts/North Korea\nQ. Mr. President, 11 of your predecessors decided against going to Hiroshima. What do you know that they didn't? What were they worried about that you aren't?\nAnd just sort of generally on nonproliferation—because I think that's your focus and that's obviously a priority for you—how do you communicate risks and concerns about this in a way that would do more to get it resolved? Because it seems to be getting worse. I mean, Americans worry a lot about terrorists with suicide vests, which are unlikely events that can kill dozens. Do they worry enough about the risks of nuclear mishaps or attacks, which are unlikely events that could potentially kill millions instead of dozens? In short, are we paying enough attention to Kim Jong Un and Pakistani tactical——\nThe President. Right.\nQ. ——nuclear weapons, the sorts of things that you know are going on?\nThe President. Okay. Well, it's a terrific question. First of all, I won't characterize how other Presidents were thinking about these issues. I can tell you how I'm thinking about it, and that is that the dropping of the atomic bomb, the ushering in of nuclear weapons was an inflection point in modern history. It is something that all of us have had to deal with in one way or another. Obviously, it's not as prominent in people's thinking as it was during the cold war, at a time when our parents or grandparents were huddling under desks in frequent drills. But the backdrop of a nuclear event remains something that, I think, presses on the back of our imaginations.\nI do think that part of the reason I'm going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have. So it's not only a reminder of the terrible toll of World War II and the death of innocents across continents, but it's also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace, and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future.\nIn some ways, we've seen real progress over the last several years. The Iran nuclear deal is a big piece of business, because without us having to fire a shot, we were able to persuade a big, sophisticated country that had a well-developed nuclear program not to develop nuclear weapons. The START II treaty that I negotiated in my first couple of years in office with the Russians has reduced our respective stockpiles. The Nuclear Security Summit and all the work that we've done on that score has made it less likely that nuclear materials fall into the hand of terrorists or nonstate actors.\nAnd although we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have liked to have seen with respect to North Korea, what we have been able to do is mobilize the international community so that their proliferation activities are scrutinized much more carefully and they have far fewer countries that are tolerant of potential actions by North Korea outside of their own program.\nHaving said that, North Korea is a big worry for all of us. They're not at the point right now where they can effectively hit U.S. targets, but each time that they test, even if those tests fail, they learn something. And it is clear that ideologically they are still convinced that—and Kim Jong Un in particular seems to be convinced that his own legitimacy is tied up with developing nuclear weapons.\nYou pointed out the continuing tensions that exist in South Asia. That is still a concern. And we know that terrorist organizations would have no compunction about using a weapon of mass destruction if they got their hands on it.\nSo we've got a lot of work to do. I think we've built up an architecture during the course of my Presidency that has made a difference, that has focused attention on some key points of vulnerability. But we're not where we need to be yet. And obviously, we haven't achieved all the goals that I set when I spoke in Prague at the beginning of my Presidency. Of course, I noted at the time that I didn't expect to be able to achieve all those goals during the course of my Presidency or even in my lifetime. And this is going to be an ongoing task, but it's one that I think we have to be paying a lot of attention to.\nQ. Just one follow-up. Mr. Kerry, your Secretary of State, called the North Korean nuclear program the biggest threat in the world right now—the gravest threat. Do you agree with that? Do you see this nuclear program as the worst thing going on?\nThe President. Well, it is not the thing necessarily that poses the most immediate risk. Obviously, ISIL using rifles and crude bombs can kill a lot of people in a Paris or a Brussels. And people are rightly insistent that the world community stamp out ISIL. So there's a reason why we are focused on that. But this is not a situation where we can afford to just focus on the short term. Over the long term, when you have such an unstable regime that is so isolated, that generally flouts international norms and rules more than perhaps any other nation on Earth, that is also devoting enormous national resources, hell-bent on getting nuclear weapons that they can fire long distances, that poses the kind of medium-term threat that we have to pay a lot of attention to.\nAnd I assure you, it's something that my administration has paid a lot of attention to. It's something that I think has been at the center of the trilateral work that we've done with our close allies in the region. It's something that we've put at the center of our discussions and negotiations with China. And as I said before, what we've seen actually is improved responses from countries like China, countries in the region, like Vietnam and Burma taking these issues much more seriously because of our engagement. And so that may reduce the risks of North Korea selling weapons or fissile material to other countries, or putting it out on the black market. But it does not, so far at least, solve the core problem of North Korea continuing to develop its program. And we're going to have to continue to work in a concerted way.\nIn the meantime, I've been working with the Pentagon for several years now on making sure that we can develop the kinds of defense architecture that can protect the United States and our allies from an unexpected escalation.\nCarol [Carol E. Lee, Wall Street Journal].\nU.S. Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you. You've said before that when you talk to world leaders, they often ask you about the Presidential election. Can you give us a sense of the conversations that you've had so far—what they're saying to you, what you're saying to them—particularly now that Donald Trump is the nominee and he recently said that Japan should pay for the U.S. troop presence there? But also, on the Democratic side, what they're saying about that and what you think of that, because it's obviously continuing to be divisive with Bernie Sanders saying he would take it to the convention. And he's endorsed your Democratic Party chair, her primary opponent. Should he change course? Do you—have you decided that you're just not going to get involved until one of them concedes to the other?\nThe President. Well, look, the world pays attention to U.S. elections. They pay more attention to our elections sometimes than we pay to theirs, because the United States is, as I've said before, at the heart of the international order. And even those countries that are critical of us, even those countries that complain or question particular policy decisions that we make know that ultimately things don't hold together so well if the United States is not making good decisions and count on us to provide a certain level of stability and direction in meeting global challenges. So they are paying very close attention to this election. I think it's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee. They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements. But they're rattled by him—and for good reason—because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous and what's required to keep the world on an even keel.\nWith respect to the Democratic primary process, as I've said before, it's been my view to let this play out, let voters make up their minds. And during primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other. It's just the nature of the process. You start off and everybody is thinking, oh, this is fine, this is going to be a friendly competition, we're going to debate ideas. And somebody says one thing, and then another person says another thing, and that felt a little sharper than I expected, and somebody's supporter pops off. And there's a certain buildup of aggravation. We saw that in my lengthy primary in 2008. This is no different.\nBut what I think is really important to remember is that, unlike what you've seen in the Democratic—or in Republican primary, for the most part there's not that big a difference in—ideologically in terms of the issues. Both Hillary and Bernie believe that every American should have health care. Both of them think that we've got to make college more affordable. Both of them believe that it's important for us to have a tax system that is fair and that we should be closing corporate loopholes in order to pay for things like infrastructure investment and early childhood education.\nI mean, if you put their proposals side by side, they're all pointing in the same direction, and the differences are primarily tactical. They had to do with how do you get some of this stuff done. So that doesn't mean that those aren't serious questions to ask and debate. It does mean, though, that once the primary process is resolved, the ability for us to pull together around a common vision that is in sharp contrast to the vision that's being offered on the other side, I think, is one that will get done by the time of the convention.\nI would urge—and have urged—both sides to try to stick to the issues, because a lot of that grumpiness arises where folks feel as if we're not talking about an issue, but we're talking about personalities and character. And they're both good people. I know them both well. And I think that it's important for us to try to end this in a way that leaves both sides feeling proud of what they've done. And both sides have run serious, competitive races, and debated issues in a serious way. So I'm proud of Democrats for doing that.\nAnd, Carol, as you know—I sure know, because I've been through this a bunch of times—there is just the natural impulse when you're having to report every day on campaigns that every little blip, speed bump, conflict, trash talking that takes place is elevated, not to mention polls. And the one thing I've learned after being around for a while is, that kind of day-to-day choppiness is not indicative of longer term trends. I feel confident about the Democratic vision for the country, and I feel confident about our ability not just to win elections, but more importantly, to deliver on behalf of the American people and the issues they care about.\nQ. Does it going—this going until the end of July make it harder to defeat Mr. Trump?\nThe President. No. Look, would it be nice if everybody was immediately unified and singing \"Kumbaya\" and whoever the nominee ended up being could just take a nice 2-week vacation to recharge? Absolutely. I guarantee you that the eventual nominee sure wishes it was over now, because this is a grind. It's hard. And in some ways, it's—one of the things I've always found is that it's a lot more draining arguing against your friends than it is arguing against your political opponents. It just—it weighs on you more. Being criticized by folks who are in your own party always hurts just a little bit more.\nAnd so it takes a little energy out of you. But these are folks who are serious about trying to solve the country's problems. They're both veterans of the political grind. And so they're going to hold up. And by the time we get to the convention, I'm confident they'll be in good shape.\nAs a special bonus, I'm going to take one more question. Go ahead.\nU.S. Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned some tactical differences between the two Democratic candidates. But when you hear Bernie Sanders speak, it seems like he's talking more about the issue of trustability and the need for a political revolution. And just yesterday we saw the State Department's Inspector General put out a report about Secretary Clinton's e-mails, and it basically undermined some of what she has said about her e-mail practices. I'm wondering if you think that undermines her trustworthiness with the American people, and if you agree with Bernie Sanders that she should release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches to Wall Street.\nThe President. Okay. You know what, I take it back. I'm not taking another question. [Laughter] We're in Japan. Don't we have something in Asia that we want to talk about? I'll be talking about this in Washington the whole time.\nLook, I've already said a lot about those issues. I think those are better directed to the campaign. As I said before, during the course of a primary, people say what they think might help them get some votes. And once the campaign is over, then they move on, and they make an assessment in terms of how they can make sure that the vision that they care most deeply about has the best chance of passing a Congress and getting signed by a President and that Supreme Court nominees are confirmed and all the things that make for a functioning, effective Government.\nSo I think that the noise that is going on back and forth between the candidates at this point, if you want insights into how they're thinking about it, those should be directed to them.\nI'll take——\nQ. Can I ask a China question?\nThe President. You—I'm going to—you've already had a question, so if I'm going to ask another question, I think it's fair to give it to——\nQ. That's true. That's true. Yes, sir.\nAfghanistan\nQ. Can I ask you your thinking on the new Taliban leader and how that affects prospects for peace in the region?\nThe President. Well, as I was saying to my team, I wasn't expecting a liberal democrat to be the newly appointed leader of the Taliban. So this continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan. We have a democratically elected Government in Afghanistan that we're supporting, and our goal right now is to make sure that that Constitution and that democratic process is upheld, not to mention that we're able to maintain the counterterrorism platforms that we need in that region so that Al Qaida and now ISIL are not able to take root and use that as bases to attack us in the United States.\nMy hope—although not my expectation—is that there comes a point at which the Taliban recognizes that they are not going to simply be able to overrun the country and that what they need to be doing is to enter into serious reconciliation talks that are led by Afghans. And I think if that happens, that's something that the United States and others in the world community would support. But I am doubtful that that will be happening anytime soon. And we'll have to wait and see how those things develop.\nIn the short term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and VBIEDs and blowing up innocent people, and the kinds of actions that have characterized their approach over the last 15, 20 years. But I do think that there will come a point, perhaps not this year, next year, but eventually, where there are those within the community that surrounds the Taliban, at least, that recognize, their goals are best achieved by negotiations.\nOkay?\nThe President's Meeting With Dissidents in Vietnam/Burma/Cuba/Human Rights/U.S. Foreign Policy\nQ. What about those Vietnamese activists that were banned from the meeting——\nQ. Right, is that embarrassing that they couldn't show up?\nThe President. To me——\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. ——or to them? Why is it embarrassing to me?\nQ. Well, because you invited these people, and they didn't show up.\nThe President. Well, I wasn't the one who held them up. Look, I was very blunt with the Vietnamese Government. There is so much good going on in that country, and what I indicated to them is that these kinds of heavy-handed actions end up being entirely counterproductive. And the folks we invited, including those who were there, are people that are prepared to have a constructive conversation with the Government about how to advance peace and prosperity and economic development and environmental security in that country.\nAnd my general message, as you heard at the youth town hall meeting, is harness that talent. Let them loose to create startups and to solve problems and engage them. It's the same message I had with Cuba. It's the same message that I had in a wide range of countries where you still are seeing serious problems with human rights.\nThe one thing I'm absolutely convinced of, though, is, is that by us engaging, by us meeting with civil society activists, it helps move the ball, it moves the needle. It doesn't solve these problems immediately. Right now Burma/Myanmar is undergoing this democratic transformation, in part because of the process that we helped to spearhead. They are going through revolutionary changes over the last several years. But I guarantee you that there's still some human rights activists inside of Burma/Myanmar who are being harassed, are not able to speak freely, are not able to assemble the way we would expect them to be able to do in our own country. When I went to Cuba and I met with those dissidents, one of the individuals who was there still had cuts in his wrists from handcuffs because he had been detained just the day before. I didn't come out of that meeting thinking the problems of human rights in Cuba are solved. But what I'm pretty darn sure of is, is that by us meeting with them, by us shining a spotlight on their stories, by us indicating not that we were going to dictate how these societies develop, but that we do think there are certain universal values that we care deeply about and that we're going to stand with—that that helps.\nAnd that, I think, is the biggest lesson over the course of the 7 years as we've been engaging some of these countries with serious human rights problems. The expectation that I think sometimes we've had that if we just stand back and scold, that somehow that's going to change these internal dynamics has proven to be less effective than us engaging. Indicating to governments that we're prepared to work with them, but that they need to make progress, and continually trying to lift up the actions of these civil society leaders in a way that provides them a little bit more space, and that space slowly grows, and it ends up being a process, and it's not always a process that travels in a straight line. Sometimes, you take two steps forward, you take a step back. Sometimes, you start seeing openings in some of these societies, and then governments get nervous, and they clamp back down.\nBut that steady pressure, combined with an appreciation of the history of these countries, combined with a willingness to listen, combined with an ability to mobilize the international community so that we're not thinking that we're doing this all by ourselves, over time, we've seen results. More modest than I would hope, but that's true of pretty much everything about foreign policy and domestic policy and the human condition.\nAll right?\nQ. Mr. President——\nQ. Speaking of——\nThe President. Okay, guys. I gave you a couple—I already gave you bonuses. I gave you a bunch of bonuses.

Those who serve under the stars and stripes embody the highest form of citizenship, and on Memorial Day, we pay solemn tribute to those brave Americans who laid down their lives to defend our freedom.\nSince America's earliest days, proud patriots have forged a safer, more secure Nation, and though battlefields have changed and technology has evolved, the selflessness of our service members has remained steadfast. They have stepped forward when our country was locked in revolution and civil war; fought threats of fascism and terrorism; and led the way in securing peace and stability around the globe. They have sacrificed more than most of us could ever imagine—not for glory or gratitude, but for causes greater than themselves. In the children who replicate their courage and strength, in the spouses and partners who forever seek to mend their broken hearts, and in the parents who mourn the absence of the sons and daughters they raised, we are reminded of our enduring commitment to do right by our fallen warriors and their families.\nThose who gave their last full measure of devotion for the values that bind us as one people deserve our utmost respect and gratitude. In recognizing those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we pledge to never stop working to fulfill our obligations to all members of our Armed Forces so they know we stand beside them every step of the way—not just when we need them, but also when they need us.\nToday, and every day, let us remember the servicemen and women we have lost, and let us honor them by rededicating ourselves to strengthening our Nation's promise. With love, grace, and reflection, let us honor our fallen fellow Americans, known and unknown, who sacrificed their freedom to ensure our own.\nIn honor of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 30, 2016, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time during which people may unite in prayer.\nI also ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-26", "title": "Proclamation 9454—Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2016"}

The G-7 underscored its responsibility to lead international efforts to tackle these challenges and forge a path forward.\n• Iraq: G-7 leaders expressed support for Iraq, commended Iraqi forces' efforts in the fight against ISIL/Da'esh, and confirmed their readiness to supplement a potential new International Monetary Fund (IMF) program by mobilizing more than $3.6 billion in bilateral and other direct budget assistance to Iraq, which will help unlock up to $18 billion in assistance for Iraq over three years.\n• Russia and Ukraine: G-7 leaders expressed concern about continued violence in Ukraine and urged all sides to take concrete steps toward the complete ceasefire required under the Minsk agreements. Leaders stressed that sanctions are linked to Russia's complete implementation of the Minsk agreements and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty. G-7 leaders stand ready to take additional measures should Russia's actions so require. G-7 leaders expressed support for recent Ukrainian reforms.\n• Syria: G-7 leaders condemned violations of the Cessation of Hostilities (COH), called on all parties to fully implement the COH, welcomed the commitment of the International Syria Support Group to help ensure parties stop indiscriminate attacks, and called on the Syrian regime to allow humanitarian agencies access in Syria. G-7 leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to political transition and to working towards long-term, post-conflict stabilization and rehabilitation of Syria.\n• Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism (CT/CVE): G-7 leaders took steps to increase information sharing to bolster border and aviation security; strengthen coordination of capacity-building assistance to partner countries through entities such as the Global Counterterrorism Forum's International CT/CVE Clearinghouse Mechanism; and deepen cooperation on countering the financing of terrorism.\n• Maritime Security: G-7 leaders reiterated their commitment to a rules-based order at sea, peaceful dispute settlement, and respect for freedom of navigation and overflight. G-7 leaders also reaffirmed the importance of states' making and clarifying their claims based on international law; refraining from unilateral actions; not using force or coercion; and seeking to settle disputes by peaceful means including through juridical procedures.\nResponding to the Global Displacement Crisis\nWith displacement approaching levels not seen since the Second World War, G-7 leaders recognized the global nature of the crisis and affirmed the need to humanely and effectively manage displacement. G-7 leaders committed to bolster global refugee and host community assistance and welcomed efforts to strengthen long-term global capacity and effectiveness to respond to crises. To this end, G-7 leaders asked the World Bank to develop a global crisis response platform that will assist host states in providing sustainable livelihoods and education for both refugee populations and their communities. The platform will help advance the objectives of the President's Summit on Refugees that will be held on the margins of the UN General Assembly in September.\nAchieving Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Global Economic Growth\nWhile U.S. businesses have added 14.6 million jobs over a record 74 consecutive months of job growth, global economic growth remains moderate and uneven. G-7 leaders committed to implementing fiscal policy flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation, and confidence. The G-7 stands ready to deploy robust policy responses to bolster short and longer-term growth as necessary. G-7 leaders reiterated their commitment to using all policy tools to strengthen global demand and address supply constraints. In addition, G-7 leaders reaffirmed their exchange rate commitments, including close consultation on actions in foreign exchange markets and not targeting exchange rates.\nG-7 leaders also noted their intent to promote quality infrastructure investment, including through effective resource mobilization in partnership with the private sector. To this end, President Obama has put forward a bold plan for a 21st Century Clean Transportation System that boosts growth while reducing carbon pollution. The United States has also been promoting infrastructure investment through the Build America Investment Initiative, a plan to encourage public-private partnerships and private investment.\nLeveling the Playing Field for International Trade and Investment\nG-7 leaders underscored their commitment to using trade to create economic opportunity for their worker and firms, noting that trade is a key driver of growth and prosperity. Since G-7 leaders last met, the United States, Canada, and Japan have worked with 9 other countries to conclude negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). G-7 leaders encouraged each TPP signatory to complete its domestic process to bring the agreement into force. In addition, the United States and the European Commission committed to applying the necessary political will to reach an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement (T-TIP) as early as this year.\n• Addressing Global Industrial Excess Capacity: G-7 leaders recognized that global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel, is having a negative impact on G-7 economies and workers. G-7 leaders committed to quickly taking steps to address this issue, including through coordinated actions that seek to eliminate subsidies and other policies that contribute to excess capacity. G-7 leaders called on their respective policy experts to coordinate actions, working with other countries affected by this issue. The United States has begun coordinating efforts to address excess capacity with the G-7 and other major steel producers. The United States is currently enforcing 149 anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders involving foreign steel imports.\n• Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA): The United States and other G-7 members are part of a broader negotiation on an agreement to eliminate tariffs on environmental goods. G-7 leaders announced their aim to conclude an ambitious EGA ahead of the G-20 Summit in Hangzhou in September 2016.\n• Moving Forward at the World Trade Organization (WTO): G-7 leaders underscored the critical importance of the rules-based global trading system as embodied by the WTO. G-7 leaders discussed moving forward at the WTO to address outstanding and new issues and called on all WTO members to engage constructively and with a sense of urgency. G-7 leaders also called for the entry into force of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement by the end of 2016, which will eliminate bureaucratic delay for merchandise shipped around the world.\nEnhancing Financial Transparency and Tackling Corruption\nReflecting their common values of fairness and the rule of law, and in order to promote strong economic growth and sustainable development, the G-7 leaders reaffirmed their aim to enhance financial transparency, combat tax evasion, and tackle corruption. As the G-7 recognizes the continuing need to foster public confidence in tax systems, the United States will continue to show leadership in this area.\n• Enhancing Financial Transparency and Combating Illicit Finance: G-7 leaders reiterated the importance of improving the transparency of the beneficial ownership of legal entities to prevent misuse of these entities for corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing, and money laundering. The actions announced by President Obama on May 6 to bolster the transparency of beneficial ownership information in the United States represented a significant step forward. The United States also continues to work in the G-7 and G-20 to support the Financial Action Task Force.\n• Advancing the International Anti-Corruption Agenda: G-7 leaders pledged continued action on: promoting practical cooperation between countries on asset recovery cases; building capacity in countries vulnerable to corruption; and supporting the work of civil society, the private sector, and journalists to contribute to anti-corruption reform and expose corruption and bribery.\nPromoting Stability, Innovation, and Growth in Cyberspace\nG-7 leaders committed to support an open, secure, and reliable cyberspace that promotes economic growth and prosperity. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to support stability in cyberspace by promoting the application of international law to state behavior in cyberspace, voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in peacetime, and close cooperation against malicious cyber activity. The G-7 reiterated its commitment to protect the same human rights online as offline. Leaders also recommitted to work together on the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.\nThe G-7 leaders also addressed issues key to the growth of the digital economy. Leaders emphasized the importance of the free flow of data and their opposition to unjustifiable data localization requirements. The G-7 also committed to support transparent policy and legal frameworks and to promote international standards for technology products. They emphasized the importance of protecting intellectual property rights, opposed generally applicable requirements for access to source code as a condition of market access, and reaffirmed that states should not conduct or knowingly support the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain. Further, leaders committed to promote a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance. Finally, the G-7 committed to improve global access to the Internet, which aligns with the objective of the U.S.'s Global Connect Initiative to bring another 1.5 billion people online by 2020.\nAddressing Climate Change, Protecting the Environment, and Strengthening Energy Security\nG-7 leaders recognized the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and reaffirmed their commitment to address climate change. To maintain momentum, G-7 leaders committed to taking the necessary steps to secure ratification, acceptance, or approval of the agreement as soon as possible, and called on all parties to do so, striving for a goal of having the agreement enter into force in 2016. Currently, 40 countries representing 50 percent of emissions have either joined the Agreement or have committed to work to join this year, putting implementation within reach in 2016. G-7 leaders also committed to complete mid-century low-emission development strategies well ahead of 2020.\nIn addition, G-7 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and called on all countries to do so by 2025 - the first announcement of a target date to achieve the goal originally outlined by the G-20 in 2009.\n• Leading in International Fora: G-7 leaders pledged to support the adoption of a Global Market-Based Measure to address aviation emissions in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and an amendment to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the Montreal Protocol. The ICAO efforts aim to enable carbon-neutral growth in the civil aviation sector from 2020, while an HFC amendment would help shave up to half a degree off warming by the end of the century. Leaders pledged additional support to the Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund to help transition away from HFCs.\n• Addressing Short-Lived Climate Pollutants: G-7 leaders recognized the importance of mitigating emissions from other short-lived climate pollutants like methane and black carbon, and resolved to drive down methane emissions. The Obama Administration has set an ambitious but achievable goal to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.\n• Ensuring Nuclear Safety and Security: G-7 leaders called upon all countries to ensure the highest standards of safety, security, and non-proliferation in nuclear energy programs. Leaders also welcomed the successful outcomes of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit on March 31-April 1 in Washington.\nAdvancing Global Health and the Global Health Security Agenda\nRecognizing the continued threat posed by diseases such as Zika, and determined to learn the lessons of the Ebola crisis, the G-7 leaders addressed a wide-ranging health agenda in Ise-Shima. This included committing concrete assistance to strengthen country capacity to address infectious disease threats; reinforcing the global health architecture to strengthen the response to public health emergencies; moving towards the goal of universal health coverage; and combating antimicrobial resistance.\n• Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda: G-7 leaders reinforced support for a coordinated approach to assist 76 countries and regions build the capability to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats. The G-7 will offer to assist partners in developing national plans, and will measure progress according to the targets of the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool published by the World Health Organization, which includes each of the targets of the Global Health Security Agenda launched by President Obama in 2014. In preparing for health emergencies, G-7 leaders committed to undergo and share the results of JEEs. The United States is committed to assist at least 31 of the 76 partners to develop national plans, and is currently undergoing a JEE.\n• Supporting Replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund): G-7 leaders expressed their support for a successful 5th replenishment of the Global Fund and called on traditional and new donors to support replenishment as well. Growing out of discussions at the G-8 summit in 2000, the Global Fund has saved an estimated 17 million lives since its inception in 2002.\n• Addressing Antimicrobial Resistance: G-7 leaders made a renewed commitment to address the global health threat posed by antimicrobial resistance. Leaders highlighted the need to build country capacity for surveillance and training in judicious use of antibiotics and to preserve the utility of existing remedies, while also discovering new ones, through a robust and coordinated set of approaches.\nAdvancing Women's Empowerment and Gender Equality\nG-7 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and to the belief that women and girls are equal and indispensable agents of change in our societies. G-7 leaders also affirmed the importance of promoting and protecting women's rights and underlined the role of women as key actors to ensure peace and security. The G-7 recognized that the role of women is critical to addressing challenges such as of violent extremism, the global displacement crisis, and protracted conflicts. The G-7 also made specific commitments around empowering women and girls through education, promoting opportunities for women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and advancing the Women, Peace, and Security agenda.\nPromoting Sustainable Development\nWith the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 2015 marked a landmark year for development. The G-7 resolved to make further efforts to implement its commitments.\n• Implementing the 2030 Agenda: Recognizing the universality of the 2030 Agenda, G-7 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to take ambitious steps to implement it domestically and continue to support implementation efforts by developing countries. Leaders also affirmed their strong commitment to the timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda adopted at the 2015 Financing for Development conference, which represents a consensus that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will require unlocking three streams of financing: the mobilization of domestic resources; private sector investments; and official development assistance and other international public finance flows. Leaders reaffirmed the essential role that official development assistance and international public finance play as catalysts for, and complements to, other sources of financing for development. To that end, the United States is a founding member of the Addis Tax Initiative. As part of this collective effort, the United States has committed to significantly increase its technical assistance for tax and fiscal management capacity building in developing countries, in order to help strengthen developing countries' capacity to mobilize and effectively use domestic resources to achieve the SDGs and finance their own development. G-7 leaders noted their commitment to the principles outlined in the Addis Tax Initiative.\n• Strengthening Food Security and Nutrition: G-7 leaders mapped out concrete next steps to promote global food security and nutrition. The United States will support these efforts through Feed the Future, the President's global hunger and food security initiative launched in 2010. In addition, recognizing the importance of data to achieving global food security and nutrition goals, the G-7 acknowledged the importance of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative, which makes agricultural and nutritional data available globally.", "timestamp": "2016-05-27", "title": "Fact Sheet: The G-7 Summit at Ise-Shima Japan"}

And I wanted to come by and just say thank you: Thank you to all the men and women in uniform, thank you to your families, because you guys are the backbone of our alliance. Thank you, everybody.\nI want to thank Colonel Boucher, also known as Waterboy. [Laughter] I want to thank Sergeant Major Garza. I know that we've got a lot of folks in the house.

[Laughter]\nBut let me just say that, as President of the United States, I have no greater honor than serving as Commander in Chief to our men and women in uniform. You serve and protect the American people. You promote peace and security around the world. And I especially welcome the chance to be with you as we enter into Memorial Day weekend, because it's a reminder of the risks and the sacrifices that are part of your job, and it's a reminder that we can never forget that we have to honor all of those who have given everything for our freedom.\nAs President, I've made sure that the United States is leading again in the Asia-Pacific, because this region is vital to our shared security and prosperity. And that takes security cooperation. It takes trade agreements. It takes relationships built between people. And it takes the proud service of our men and women in uniform throughout the region, working with our outstanding men and women who serve the armed forces of Japan.\nNow, as you know, this afternoon I will visit Hiroshima. And this is an opportunity to honor the memory of all who were lost during World War II. It's a chance to reaffirm our commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a war where nuclear weapons would no longer be necessary. And it's a testament to how even the most painful divides can be bridged; how our two nations—former adversaries—cannot just become partners, but become the best of friends and the strongest of allies.\nWe see the strength of our alliance on display right here. This base is a powerful example of the trust and the cooperation and the friendship between the United States and Japan. American Marines working side by side with Japanese Self-Defense Forces to protect the peace and engage with our partners throughout the region and assist with humanitarian aid and disaster relief. You've responded to flooding in the Philippines and in Thailand. You've responded to devastating cyclones in Bangladesh. You played a critical role in relief efforts following the 2011 earthquake and the tsunami here in Japan. So, together, you have saved countless lives across the region. And we could not be prouder of that.\nYour service, right here, is rooted in the shared values of today's Japan and today's United States: the values of freedom, the values of democracy, the values of human rights, the values of rule of law. And as a result, our alliance hasn't just been essential to the security of our two countries. It's an indispensable source of stability and a foundation for prosperity in this region and around the world. You are the foundation of our quality of life.\nSo I want to close with an incredible story that captures the essence of our alliance. Where is Captain Tessa Snow? Where is Tessa? You're out here somewhere, I know.\nAudience member. Right here!\nThe President. There she is. Captain Snow is an Osprey pilot, and in the aftermath of the Kumamoto earthquakes last month, she and her squadron flew missions to bring humanitarian aid and supplies to those in need. And one Japanese family was so worried about their house collapsing that they spent several nights outside. Thanks to your efforts, that family and so many others received food and water and the supplies that they needed.\nAnd now this family is expecting a baby—a baby girl—in June. When they heard that Tessa flew the mission that helped save them, they decided to name their baby after Tessa. They want their daughter to grow up with the same qualities that Tessa has: honor and courage and commitment and a willingness to help others.\nAren't those the core values of the Marine Corps?\nAudience members. Oorah!\nThe President. Qualities that, for generations, have defined our men and women in uniform. They're the qualities that represent the very best of our two nations. And because of your service, our shared commitment to human dignity and freedom will endure, and this region will prosper. And we will continue to spread hope wherever we travel. I'm very proud of you. I'm very grateful to our Japanese hosts. I couldn't be prouder of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces.\nGod bless all of you. God bless your families. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-05-27", "title": "Remarks to United States and Japanese Troops at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Iwakuni, Japan"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 5:45 p.m. Prime Minister Abe spoke in Japanese, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117688", "text": "President Obama. Seventy-one years ago, on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky, and the world was changed. A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city and demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself.\nWhy do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in a not-so-distant past. We come to mourn the dead, including over 100,000 Japanese men, women, and children; thousands of Koreans; a dozen Americans held prisoner. Their souls speak to us. They ask us to look inward, to take stock of who we are and what we might become.\nIt is not the fact of war that sets Hiroshima apart. Artifacts tell us that violent conflict appeared with the very first man. Our early ancestors, having learned to make blades from flint and spears from wood, used these tools not just for hunting, but against their own kind. On every continent, the history of civilization is filled with war, whether driven by scarcity of grain or hunger for gold, compelled by nationalist fervor or religious zeal. Empires have risen and fallen. Peoples have been subjugated and liberated. And at each juncture, innocents have suffered, a countless toll, their names forgotten by time.\nThe World War that reached its brutal end in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was fought among the wealthiest and most powerful of nations. Their civilizations had given the world great cities and magnificent art. Their thinkers had advanced ideas of justice and harmony and truth. And yet the war grew out of the same base instinct for domination or conquest that had caused conflicts among the simplest tribes, an old pattern amplified by new capabilities and without new constraints. In the span of a few years, some 60 million people would die: men, women, children no different than us, shot, beaten, marched, bombed, jailed, starved, gassed to death.\nThere are many sites around the world that chronicle this war: memorials that tell stories of courage and heroism; graves and empty camps that echo of unspeakable depravity. Yet in the image of a mushroom cloud that rose into these skies, we are most starkly reminded of humanity's core contradiction; how the very spark that marks us as a species—our thoughts, our imagination, our language, our tool-making, our ability to set ourselves apart from nature and bend it to our will—those very things also give us the capacity for unmatched destruction.\nHow often does material advancement or social innovation blind us to this truth. How easily we learn to justify violence in the name of some higher cause. Every great religion promises a pathway to love and peace and righteousness, and yet no religion has been spared from believers who have claimed their faith as a license to kill. Nations arise, telling a story that binds people together in sacrifice and cooperation, allowing for remarkable feats, but those same stories have so often been used to oppress and dehumanize those who are different.\nScience allows us to communicate across the seas and fly above the clouds, to cure disease and understand the cosmos. But those same discoveries can be turned into ever-more efficient killing machines. The wars of the modern age teach this truth. Hiroshima teaches this truth. Technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.\nThat is why we come to this place. We stand here, in the middle of this city, and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell. We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see. We listen to a silent cry. We remember all the innocents killed across the arc of that terrible war and the wars that came before and the wars that would follow.\nMere words cannot give voice to such suffering, but we have a shared responsibility to look directly into the eye of history and ask what we must do differently to curb such suffering again. Someday the voices of the hibakusha will no longer be with us to bear witness. But the memory of the morning of August 6, 1945, must never fade. That memory allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change.\nAnd since that fateful day, we have made choices that give us hope. The United States and Japan forged not only an alliance, but a friendship that has won far more for our people than we could ever claim through war. The nations of Europe built a Union that replaced battlefields with bonds of commerce and democracy. Oppressed peoples and nations won liberation. An international community established institutions and treaties that worked to avoid war and aspire to restrict and roll back and ultimately eliminate the existence of nuclear weapons.\nStill, every act of aggression between nations, every act of terror and corruption and cruelty and oppression that we see around the world shows, our work is never done. We may not be able to eliminate man's capacity to do evil, so nations—and the alliances that we've formed—must possess the means to defend ourselves. But among those nations like my own that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them.\nWe may not realize this goal in my lifetime. But persistent effort can roll back the possibility of catastrophe. We can chart a course that leads to the destruction of these stockpiles. We can stop the spread to new nations and secure deadly materials from fanatics.\nAnd yet that is not enough. For we see around the world today how even the crudest rifles and barrel bombs can serve up violence on a terrible scale. We must change our mindset about war itself: to prevent conflict through diplomacy and strive to end conflicts after they've begun; to see our growing interdependence as a cause for peaceful cooperation and not violent competition; to define our nations not by our capacity to destroy, but by what we build.\nAnd perhaps above all, we must reimagine our connection to one another as members of one human race. For this, too, is what makes our species unique. We're not bound by genetic code to repeat the mistakes of the past. We can learn. We can choose. We can tell our children a different story: one that describes a common humanity, one that makes war less likely and cruelty less easily accepted.\nWe see these stories in the hibakusha: the woman who forgave a pilot who flew the plane that dropped the atomic bomb, because she recognized that what she really hated was war itself; the man who sought out families of Americans killed here, because he believed their loss was equal to his own.\nMy own Nation's story began with simple words: All men are created equal and endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Realizing that ideal has never been easy, even within our own borders, even among our own citizens.\nBut staying true to that story is worth the effort. It is an ideal to be strived for, an ideal that extends across continents and across oceans. The irreducible worth of every person, the insistence that every life is precious, the radical and necessary notion that we are part of a single human family—that is the story that we all must tell.\nThat is why we come to Hiroshima. So that we might think of people we love: the first smile from our children in the morning, the gentle touch from a spouse over the kitchen table, the comforting embrace of a parent. We can think of those things and know that those same precious moments took place here 71 years ago. Those who died, they are like us. Ordinary people understand this, I think. They do not want more war. They would rather that the wonders of science be focused on improving life and not eliminating it.\nWhen the choices made by nations, when the choices made by leaders, reflect this simple wisdom, then the lesson of Hiroshima is done.\nThe world was forever changed here. But today, the children of this city will go through their day in peace. What a precious thing that is. It is worth protecting and then extending to every child. That is the future we can choose, a future in which Hiroshima and Nagasaki are known not as the dawn of atomic warfare, but as the start of our own moral awakening.\nPrime Minister Abe. Last year, at the 70th anniversary of the end of war, I visited the United States and made a speech as Prime Minister of Japan at a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress. That war deprived many American youngsters of their dreams and futures. Reflecting upon such harsh history, I offered my eternal condolences to all the American souls that were lost during World War II. I expressed gratitude and respect for all the people in both Japan and the United States who have been committed to reconciliation for the past 70 years.\nSeventy years later, enemies who fought each other so fiercely have become friends, bonded in spirit, and have become allies, bound in trust and friendship, deep between us. The Japan-U.S. alliance, which came into the world this way, has to be an alliance of hope for the world.\nSo I appealed in the speech. One year has passed since then. This time, President Obama, for the first time as leader of the United States, paid a visit to Hiroshima, the city which suffered the atomic bombing. U.S. President witnessing the reality of atomic bombings and renewing his determination for a world free of nuclear weapons, this gives great hope to people all around the world who have never given up their hope for a world without nuclear weapons.\nI would like to give a wholehearted welcome to this historic visit, which had been awaited not only by the people of Hiroshima, but also by all the Japanese people. I express my sincere respect to the decision and courage of President Obama. With his decision and courage, we are opening a new chapter to the reconciliation of Japan and the United States and in our history of trust and friendship.\nA few minutes ago, together, I and President Obama offered our deepest condolences for all those who lost their lives during World War II and also by the atomic bombings. Seventy-one years ago in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki, a great number of innocent citizens' lives were cost by a single atomic bomb without mercy. Many children and many citizens perished. Each one of them had his or her lifedream and beloved family. When I reflect on this sheer fact, I cannot help, but feel painful grief.\nEven today, there are victims who are still suffering unbearably from the bombings. Feeling of those who went through unimaginable tragic experiences, indeed, in this city 71 years ago, it is unspeakable. In their minds, various feelings must have come and gone, but of those, this must be in common: At any place in the world, this tragedy must not be repeated again.\nIt is the responsibility of us who live in the present to firmly inherit these deep feelings. We are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons. No matter how long and how difficult the road will be, it is the responsibility of us who live in the present to continue to make efforts.\nChildren who were born on that unforgettable day lit the light believing in permanent peace. To make every effort for the peace and prosperity in the world, vowing for this light, this is the responsibility of us all who live in the present. We will definitely fulfill our responsibility. Together, Japan and the United States will become a light for hope, for the people in the world. Standing in this city, I am firmly determined, together with President Obama. This is the only way to respond to the feelings of the countless spirits: victims of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I am convinced of this.", "timestamp": "2016-05-27", "title": "Remarks With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan"}

It also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization, also known \"Da'esh.\" An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117689", "text": "G7 Ise-Shima Summit, 26-27 May 2016\nPreamble\nWe, the leaders of the G7, met in Ise-Shima on 26 and 27 May 2016 to address major global economic and political challenges. Global growth remains moderate and below potential, while risks of weak growth persist. Escalated geo-political conflicts, terrorism and refugee flows complicate the global economic environment. The rise of violent extremism, terrorist attacks and other challenges, pose serious threat to the existing rule based international order, as well as to common values and principles for all humanity.\nThe G7 has a special responsibility to lead international efforts to tackle these challenges. We remain bound together as a group guided by our common values and principles, including freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Furthermore, following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and the Paris Agreement on climate change last year, we will further make efforts to implement our commitments. Today, we have demonstrated our capacity to make tangible progress on a broad range of economic, security, and development policy issues, and we will demonstrate through our actions, a path forward in solving major issues to ensure peace, security and prosperity of the world.\nG7 Ise-Shima Economic Initiative\nWe pledge to collectively tackle current economic challenges, while laying out foundations for stronger long-term global growth. Therefore, we have developed our commitment in the following areas as our response to contribute to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth.\n• World Economy: Global growth is our urgent priority. Taking into account country-specific circumstances, we commit to strengthening our economic policy responses in a cooperative manner and to employing a more forceful and balanced policy mix, in order to swiftly achieve a strong, sustainable and balanced growth pattern. • We reiterate our commitments to using all policy tools—monetary, fiscal and structural—individually and collectively, to strengthen global demand and address supply constraints, while continuing our efforts to put debt on a sustainable path. We reaffirm the important role of mutually-reinforcing fiscal, monetary and structural policies, the three pronged approach, to buttress our efforts to achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. We concur on the importance of strengthening our efforts in a cooperative manner to implement our fiscal strategies flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation and confidence, while enhancing resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path, as well as to advance structural reform decisively. We are committed to advancing structural reforms to boost growth, productivity and potential output and to leading by example in addressing structural challenges. We commit to further investment in areas conducive to economic growth, such as environment, energy, digital economy, human resource development, education, science and technology. • Migration and Refugees: The G7 recognizes the ongoing large scale movements of migrants and refugees as a global challenge which requires a global response. We commit to increase global assistance to meet immediate and long-term needs of refugees and other displaced persons as well as their host communities. The G7 encourages international financial institutions and bilateral donors to bolster their financial and technical assistance. • Trade: We are committed to using trade to create economic opportunities for workers, consumers and firms. We reaffirm our commitment to keep our markets open and to fight all forms of protectionism. In order to further boost free trade, we commit to strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system and promote WTO negotiations. We also encourage trade liberalization efforts through regional trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). We recognize that global excess capacity in industrial sectors, especially steel, is a pressing structural challenge with global implications and this issue needs to be urgently addressed through elimination of market distorting measures and, thereby, enhancement of market function. • Infrastructure: We endorse the G7 Ise-Shima Principles for Promoting Quality Infrastructure Investment to address the global demand-supply gap and strive to align our own infrastructure investment with the Principles. We further encourage the relevant stakeholders, including multilateral development banks (MDBs), to align their infrastructure investment and assistance with the Principles. • Health: We commit to take concrete actions for advancing global health as elaborated in the G7 Ise-Shima Vision for Global Health, highlighting that health is the foundation of economic prosperity and security. We commit to promote Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as well as endeavor to take leadership in reinforcing response to public health emergencies and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which could have serious impacts on our economies. We also emphasize promoting research and development (R&D) and innovation in these and other health areas. • Women: We commit to create a society where all women and girls are empowered and actively engaged for sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth. We commit to empowering women and girls, including through capacity-building such as education and training as well as promoting active role of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. We endorse to the G7 Guiding Principles for Building the Capacity of Women and Girls as common guiding principles for our actions. • Cyber: We strongly support an accessible, open, interoperable, reliable and secure cyberspace as one essential foundation for economic growth and prosperity. We promote digital adoption for improved quality of life, by bridging digital divides, enabling innovative business models and affordable universal and high quality access to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as well as enhancing digital literacy. We endorse the G7 Principles and Actions on Cyber and commit to take decisive actions. • Anti-Corruption: Our collective and individual action to fight corruption is critical for economic growth, sustainable development and maintaining peace and security. We resolve to take measures to improve public procurement transparency, enhance fiscal transparency, and improve anti-corruption capacity building as well as strengthen law enforcement cooperation. We will also promote global effort to fight corruption. We endorse the G7 Action to Fight Corruption as our commitment to lead by example in moving the global anti-corruption agenda forward. • Climate: The G7, continuing to take a leadership role, commits to taking the necessary steps to secure ratification, acceptance or approval of the Paris Agreement as soon as possible, and calls on all Parties to do so striving for a goal of entry into force in 2016. We commit to take the lead by early, transparent and robust implementation of our nationally determined contributions, and promoting increased ambition over time. We also commit to actively participate in the regular review of global stock-take progress every five years. We commit to formulate and communicate ambitions mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies well ahead of the 2020 deadline. • Energy: Recognizing the important role that the energy system has to play in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, we are determined to accelerate our work towards the transition to an energy system that enables a decarbonization of the global economy, and commit to further invest in supporting innovation in energy technologies and encouraging clean energy and energy efficiency, so as to ensure economic growth with reduced GHG emissions. Faced with the increased uncertainty posed by the current energy price levels, we also commit to play a leading role in facilitating energy investments, in particular investments in quality energy infrastructure and upstream development.\nGlobal Economy\nState of the Global Economy\nThe global recovery continues, but growth remains moderate and uneven, and since we last met downside risks to the global outlook have increased. Global trade performance has disappointed in recent years. Weak demand and unaddressed structural problems are the key factors weighing on actual and potential growth. There are potential shocks of a non-economic origin. A UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend towards greater global trade and investment, and the jobs they create, and is a further serious risk to growth. Escalated geopolitical conflicts, terrorism and refugee flows, are complicating factors in the global economic environment. We have strengthened the resilience of our economies in order to avoid falling into another crisis, and to this end, commit to reinforce our efforts to address the current economic situation by taking all appropriate policy responses in a timely manner.\nPolicy Response\nIn light of this background, taking into account country-specific circumstances, we commit to strengthening our economic policy responses in a cooperative manner and to employing a more forceful and balanced policy mix, in order to swiftly achieve a strong, sustainable and balanced growth pattern. We stand ready to deploy robust policy responses to bolster short and longer-term growth as necessary. We reiterate our commitments to using all policy tools—monetary, fiscal and structural—individually and collectively, to strengthen global demand and address supply constraints, while continuing our efforts to put debt on a sustainable path. We reaffirm the important role of mutually-reinforcing fiscal, monetary and structural policies, the three pronged approach, to buttress our efforts to achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. We remain committed to ensuring that growth is inclusive and job-rich, benefitting all segments of our societies.\nMonetary policy authorities have committed to supporting the economic recovery and overcoming disinflation, consistent with their mandates, including through unconventional policies. However, monetary policy alone cannot lead to strong, sustainable and balanced growth.\nWe concur on the importance of strengthening our efforts in a cooperative manner to implement our fiscal strategies flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation and confidence, while enhancing resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path, as well as to advance structural reforms decisively. This will also allow us to respond to emerging risks and urgent social and humanitarian needs.\nWe are also making tax policy and public spending as growth-friendly as possible, including by prioritizing expenditure in favor of high-quality investment. We will consider the composition of our budget expenditures and revenues to support productivity, employment, inclusiveness and growth. We commit to ensuring that our fiscal and structural policies support sustainable social security services, which contribute to addressing our common demographic challenges. We intend to ensure an appropriate level of public investment as well as promote quality infrastructure investment to address shortfalls, including through effective resource mobilization in partnership with the private sector. We commit to further investment in areas conducive to economic growth, such as environment, energy, digital economy, human resource development, education, science and technology.\nWe are committed to advancing structural reforms to boost growth, productivity and potential output and to leading by example in addressing structural challenges. Labor market reform remains important in some of our economies. We commit to advancing labor market participation by women, the youth and the elderly, and improving job opportunity and quality. We commit to promote active labor market policies in order to ensure flexibility, inclusiveness and provide opportunities for the unemployed. We recognize the importance of achieving price stability and underline that wage dynamics should remain in line with productivity. We commit to ensuring a strong corporate governance framework that helps firms to channel corporate earnings in a productive manner to investment and wages. We are promoting competition, entrepreneurship and innovation, including by lowering barriers to new business entrants. Innovation is critical to realize sustainable growth. Competition is a source of innovation and we commit to protect intellectual property rights.\nWe recognize that global excess capacity in industrial sectors, especially steel, is a pressing structural challenge with global implications.\nWe reaffirm our existing exchange rate commitments to market determined exchange rates and to consult closely in regard to actions in foreign exchange markets. We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments and that we will not target exchange rates. We underscore the importance of all countries refraining from competitive devaluation. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.\nA stable and resilient international financial architecture is critical for economic and financial stability. We welcome the entry-into-effect of the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance reforms and reaffirm our commitment to a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF.\nFinancial Regulation\nWe reiterate our commitments to support the timely, full and consistent implementation of the G20 financial sector reform agenda, which will help us achieve our objective of sustainable economic growth. We also remain committed to finalizing the main elements of the regulatory reform agenda. We also reiterate our support for the work by the Basel Committee to refine elements of Basel III framework to ensure its coherence and maximize its effectiveness without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector. We continue to closely monitor, and if necessary, address emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with shadow banking, asset management and other market-based finance activities. We welcome the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in cooperation with other standard setting bodies (SSBs) to assess holistically the extent, drivers and possible persistence of shifts in market liquidity across jurisdictions and asset classes and consider policy measures if necessary.\nWe will also continue to enhance the monitoring of implementation and effects of reforms to ensure their consistency with our overall objectives, including by addressing any material unintended consequences. In this regard, we welcome the work by the FSB and SSBs to enhance the analysis of the effects of G20 financial regulatory reforms, including the combined effects and interaction across sectors of related reforms, and look forward to the FSB's second annual report to the G20 on implementation and effects of regulatory reforms. We intend to reap the economic benefits of technologically enabled financial innovations while managing their potential impacts on financial stability and market integrity. We welcome the work of the G7 Cyber Experts Group in the financial area to foster cyber security and enhance cooperation among G7 countries in this area. We also welcome and support the effective implementation of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. In particular, we look forward to the development of the assessment methodology of the Principles.\nTax and Transparency\nSteady, consistent and concerted implementation of the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) package is critical to restore public trust in tax systems and to achieve a global level playing field for all engaged in economic activities. We remain committed to lead the process by example. To ensure widespread implementation of the BEPS package, we encourage all relevant and interested countries and jurisdictions to commit to implement the BEPS package and join the new inclusive framework, noting that the first meeting will be held in Kyoto in June.\nTo restore public trust in tax systems by enhancing transparency of tax information, we reaffirm G20's call on all relevant countries including all financial centers and jurisdictions to implement the standard on automatic exchange of information by committed deadline and to sign the Multilateral Convention, as well as the request to the OECD to establish the \"objective criteria to identify non-cooperative jurisdictions with respect to tax transparency.\" These actions, together with possible defensive measures to be considered against non-cooperative jurisdictions, will help ensure that all relevant countries and financial centers are committed to implementing the agreed standard of tax transparency.\nWe recognize that strengthening capacity of developing countries in tax policy and administration is indispensable to level the global playing field. To enhance both quantity and quality of assistances in this area, we are committed to the principles of the Addis Tax Initiative along with encouraging other countries to make a similar commitment, and we request that the Platform for Collaboration on Tax be actively utilized to provide an opportunity where developing and developed countries and relevant organizations can share information and knowledge on a regular basis.\nImproving the transparency of the beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements is vital to prevent misuse of these entities and arrangements for corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing and money laundering. We commit to the implementation of the international standards on transparency, and call on all jurisdictions to do so. In this respect, we look forward to the initial proposals of the Financial Action Task Force and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes on ways to improve the implementation of the international standards, including on the availability of beneficial ownership information and its international exchange, to be presented by the October meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.\nTrade\nTrade and investment are key drivers of growth, the prosperity of our people and the achievement of sustainable development worldwide. It enables us to access a broad range of goods and services, enhances competitiveness thereby inviting investment and leads to job creation and improved living standards. We continue to strive for better application of internationally recognized labor, social and environmental standards in global supply chains.\nWe are committed to using trade to create economic opportunities for workers, consumers and firms. In such a highly interconnected global economy, protectionism only delivers negative consequences. We reaffirm our commitment to keep our markets open and to fight all forms of protectionism including through standstill and rollback. We remain committed to reducing barriers to trade and investment and to improving competitiveness by liberalizing our economies. We recognize the importance of ensuring a level playing field in all areas including officially supported export credit and in this regard, we reiterate our support for the International Working Group to develop guidelines for publicly supported export finance and encourage all participating parties to press for substantive progress through active engagement.\nWe recognize the negative impact of global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel, on our economies, trade and workers. In particular, we are concerned about subsidies and other support by governments and government-supported institutions that distort the market and contribute to global excess capacity, including such supports granted to overseas expansion of the capacity. We are committed to moving quickly in taking steps to address this issue by enhancing market function, including through coordinated actions that identify and seek to eliminate such subsidies and support, and by encouraging adjustment. In this regard, we are prepared to consult with other major producing countries, utilizing venues such as OECD and other fora, and, as necessary and consistent with the WTO rules and disciplines, to consider the broad range of trade policy instruments and actions to enforce our rights. Our experts will continue to coordinate actions, working with other countries affected by this issue. We underline that the rules-based multilateral trading system, which is embodied in the WTO, has helped to create a strong and prosperous world economy. We continue to strengthen the functions of the WTO, including on negotiation, dispute settlement and monitoring. We welcome the successful conclusion of the Nairobi Ministerial Conference, and in order to solidify our achieved outcomes in the recent Ministerial Conferences, call for a swift entry into force of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) by the end of 2016 and its full implementation, including through a coordinated approach to Aid for Trade, and the implementation of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) expansion as agreed. We aim to conclude an ambitious Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) that eliminates tariffs on a broad range of environmental products by the G20 Summit in September in Hangzhou, having in mind a future oriented agreement. We also look forward to concluding negotiations on an ambitious, balanced and mutually beneficial Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) by the end of 2016. At the same time, we promote forward-looking post-Nairobi discussions with our partners in various fora, addressing outstanding and new issues as well as new formats of negotiations. We call on all WTO members to engage constructively and with sense of urgency to restart negotiations in Geneva, so that the WTO meets the needs of the private sector including SMEs and other stakeholders, as digital technologies and Global Value Chains transform the global movement of goods, services and investment. As an increasing number of developing countries have started to benefit from this changing environment, we recognize the need to shed a new light on the positive role of trade on growth and development, and we look forward to useful work by the OECD and other international organizations.\nAs a useful complement and a building block to the multilateral trading system, we encourage trade liberalization efforts in various forms. The signing of the TPP is an important step forward for the establishment of a platform for common trade rules and trade integration across the Asia-Pacific region, and we encourage each TPP signatory to complete its domestic process. We welcome the strong commitment of Japan and the EU to reach agreement in principle on a comprehensive, high-level and balanced Japan-EU EPA as early as possible in 2016. We are committed to applying the necessary political will to reach a TTIP agreement as early as this year, provided that it is ambitious, comprehensive, high standard and mutually beneficial, with a view to harnessing the full potential of the transatlantic economy as soon as possible. We welcome the shared commitment of Canada and the EU to sign CETA this year. We encourage Canada and the EU to bring CETA into force as early as possible.\nInfrastructure\nThe global demand-supply gap of infrastructure investment is a serious bottleneck to the current growth including job creation and development challenges the world faces. While recognizing that effective mobilization of resources in quantity is imperative, we highlight that investment without the quality perspective could end up introducing infrastructure with higher lifecycle costs, less durability, inequitable distributive effects, highly negative environmental and social impacts, vulnerability against natural disasters and the impacts of climate change. We therefore reaffirm the crucial importance for stakeholders, including governments, international organizations and the private sector, to work coherently to bridge the existing gaps by promoting quality infrastructure investment, so as to promote strong, sustainable, and balanced growth, with an important contribution to productivity gains, and to enhance resilience in our society, as well as to contribute to the global efforts to advance sustainable development by addressing development challenges including those identified in the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. To promote such quality infrastructure investment, we strive to align our own infrastructure investment with the G7 Ise-Shima Principles for Promoting Quality Infrastructure Investment, as set out in the Annex. We further encourage the relevant stakeholders, namely governments, international organizations, including MDBs, and the private sector, such as in PPP projects, to align their infrastructure investment and assistance with the Principles, including the introduction and promotion of a transparent, competitive procurement process that takes full account of value for money and quality of infrastructure.\nHealth\nWe highlight that health is the foundation of prosperity and security not only for individuals but also for nations. At the juncture of the first G7 summit after the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda, we are fully committed to implementing the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) therein that ensure well-being at all stages and health security for all individuals, and foster inclusive economic growth for nations. Our leadership is needed more than ever in this regard. UHC provides a comprehensive framework that underpins all of the health targets. To achieve UHC, health systems need to be strong, resilient, sustainable and responsive to the current and future needs of the populations they serve. This includes, but is not limited to, promoting women's, children's, and adolescents' mental and physical health, ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights without discrimination of any kind, and addressing malnutrition as well as communicable and non-communicable diseases, including those due to environmental factors and ageing.\nLearning lessons from the Ebola outbreak, especially through the wisdom offered by a wide-range of experts across the globe, including the work of the UN High-Level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises, we recognize that health systems need to be resilient and have the capacity to respond to, better prepare for and prevent global public health threats such as pandemics and other severe events. Prompt and effective responses to public health emergencies will also require World Health Organization (WHO) reforms, funding mechanisms that enable speedy disbursement for prompt response, coordinated implementation of action among relevant stakeholders and systems, and better implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR).\nWe note that the efforts and achievements toward UHC, health system strengthening (HSS) and preparing and responding to public health emergencies are further jeopardized by the significant threat posed by AMR. We also acknowledge the importance and contribution of R&D and innovation to preserve and deploy existing remedies, and to discover new remedies for these and other health areas, such as neglected tropical diseases and poverty related infectious diseases as well as conditions related to ageing.\nWith these in mind, we particularly commit to take concrete actions in the following areas as elaborated in the G7 Ise-Shima Vision for Global Health, as set out in the Annex. We also instruct our Health Ministers to further elaborate necessary actions on these areas at their Meeting in Kobe in September.\nReinforcing of the Global Health Architecture to strengthen response to public health emergencies\nRecognizing the Ebola outbreak turned into a major epidemic partly due to the lack of swift and coordinated actions among relevant stakeholders, we commit to take leadership in reinforcing the Global Health Architecture, relying on strengthening existing organizations. We reaffirm the WHO's central role in that architecture to enable and support more swift, effective and coordinated responses to public health emergencies. In this light, we urge and support the WHO to implement its emergency and wider reforms, including its One WHO approach across the three levels of the Organization, namely its headquarters, regional and country offices, in a timely manner, recognizing its resource needs. We also highlight the vital importance of adequate, responsible and timely disbursement of financial resources to ensure appropriate response to public health emergencies. In this connection, we call on the international community to support the Contingency Fund for Emergency (CFE) to enable swift initial responses by the WHO. Further, to support a surge response by governments, multilateral agencies and NGOs, we welcome the World Bank's formal announcement of launching the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), and invite the international community including G7 members to extend technical support and financial contributions to this end. We also call upon relevant international organizations to ensure coordination among the PEF and their related funding mechanisms including the CFE.\nWe commend the WHO for accelerating efforts to lead coordination among relevant partners in large-scale outbreaks and public health emergencies, considering its central role particularly in infectious diseases and the need for continuous, predictable, rapid and efficient response throughout the development of outbreaks from small- to large-scale and into public health emergencies, leveraging existing coordination structures, particularly the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). We invite the WHO and OCHA under the UN Secretary General (UNSG) to review, strengthen and formalize coordination arrangement among the WHO, the UN and other relevant partners, and to update the G7 Health Ministers on the progress in September.\nRecent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika underscore the imperative to improve prevention of, detection of and response to public health emergencies, whether naturally occurring, deliberate or accidental. In that respect, we remain committed to advancing compliance with the WHO's IHR objectives including through the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). We renew our support to a coordinated approach to offer concrete assistance to 76 countries and regions and support to these partners to develop national plans in close coordination with the WHO and other relevant organizations. Recognizing the primary responsibility of countries to strengthen their IHR core capacities, we intend to assist these partners to achieve the common and measurable targets of the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool published by the WHO and in partnership with other organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). We also commit to support, undergo, and share such evaluations with our partners. In order to scale up the implementation of the IHR and in line with its implementation of the new Health Emergencies Program, we encourage the WHO to consider building on already existing structures, such as the Department of Global Capacities, Alert and Response and its Lyon office, and the emerging work of the Alliance for Country Assessment for Global Health Security. We recognize the importance of mobilizing financial resources of the relevant international organizations for strengthening preparedness for and prevention of pandemics, and look forward to discussing on the matter with those organizations, including the World Bank such as International Development Association.\nAttaining of UHC with strong health systems and better preparedness\nRecognizing the importance of accelerating achievement of UHC with the principle of no one left behind, we reiterate our commitment to enhance our support and coordination to strengthen health systems, especially in developing countries, to make them more resilient,\ninclusive, affordable, sustainable, and equitable ones. To this end, we emphasize the need for a strengthened international framework to coordinate the efforts and expertise of all relevant stakeholders and various fora / initiatives at the international level, including disease-specific efforts. In this connection, we support the establishment of UHC 2030 that seeks to ensure the International Health Partnership (IHP+) principles and is supported by initiatives such as the Roadmap Healthy Systems, Healthy Lives. We look forward to discussions with the UNSG about the idea of nominating an envoy to promote and catalyze efforts towards UHC across different sectors. We affirm that enhancing prevention of and preparedness for public health emergencies, including through strengthening IHR core capacities, is expected to be part of HSS efforts.\nMeanwhile, taking into consideration the pressing need for HSS in Low Income Countries (LICs) and Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) where health systems are especially weak, we are also committed to support country-led HSS in collaboration with relevant partners including the WHO. In relation to this, while stressing the need of coordination with the WHO and other relevant international organizations, we welcome the World Bank's endeavor to promote UHC for Africa. We are committed to ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, working in partnership with the Global Fund (GF) and others. To this end, we fully support a successful 5th replenishment of the GF, taking the opportunity of the GF replenishment conference in Montreal in September, and call on traditional and new donors to support the replenishment.\nThe promotion of UHC also requires provision of services to protect and improve the health of all individuals throughout their life course. As a part of such efforts and focusing on the areas where urgent responses are needed along with the rapid demographic changes, we continue to take leadership in promoting the health of women and girls, adolescents and children, including through efforts to provide access to sexual and reproductive health, rights and services, immunization, better nutrition, and needs-based responses in emergencies and disasters. In this regard, we welcome platforms such as the Global Financing Facility for Every Woman Every Child, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, and Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health, and reaffirm our continued commitment to reaching polio eradication targets. We also commit to promoting active ageing, with due consideration to gender specific aspects, through multi-sectoral approaches including the promotion of age-friendly communities and support for communities to become dementia-friendly. To this end, we share knowledge and experiences, and encourage developing countries including through the forum on active ageing to be held in Japan this year. We recognize the rising challenges of promoting a positive environment for innovative research and development, encouraging access to medicines and health care, and ensuring the sustainability of health systems, and we welcome an exchange of views on these issues at the upcoming G7 Health Ministers' meeting, recognizing the uniqueness of national circumstances, priorities, and health system designs.\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\nGood progress has been made to combat AMR including the adoption of WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and relevant resolutions by FAO and the OIE, but more needs to be done. Building on the G7's previous commitment, we commit to make collective efforts for strengthening and actively implementing a multi-sectoral One Health Approach, taking into account the sectors including human and animal health, agriculture, food and the environment. We particularly endeavor to preserve effectiveness of antimicrobials, including by preserving existing antibiotics, to strengthen the inter-sectoral surveillance in all sectors, and to improve access to effective antimicrobials through accelerated support in cooperation with other countries and private sector partners. Recognizing the need for addressing market failure in which pharmaceutical companies are not producing new diagnostics and drugs required to combat infectious diseases in the face of AMR, we also commit to consider potential for new incentives to promote R&D on AMR and call on the international community to take further action. Against those backdrops, we are committed to support the 2016 High-Level Meeting on AMR at the UN General Assembly that promotes effective implementation of the Global Action Plan through multi-sectoral global, regional, national, and community collaborative efforts, and recognize existing initiatives, such as those highlighted in the EU Ministerial One Health Conference on AMR, the Tokyo Meeting of Health Ministers on AMR in Asia, and the GHSA AMR Action Package.\nWomen's Empowerment and Gender Equality\nWe emphasize that the empowerment of women and girls and gender equality are indispensable for their equal participation as agents of change in the economic, social and political spheres of our societies. Globally, women and girls still face barriers and discrimination that prevent them from realizing their full potential. We also affirm the importance of promoting and protecting women's rights, and recognize the role of women as key actors to ensure peace and security including when addressing the threat of violent extremism, the ongoing displacement crisis and protracted conflicts and disasters. Therefore, it remains the G7's goal to create societies where all women and girls are empowered and actively engaged for sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth and peace and where their human rights are universally respected and protected. With this strong conviction in mind, we are committed to take leadership in gender-responsive approaches to implementing the SDGs and addressing climate change, and envision mainstreaming gender equality throughout the SDGs and in every policy area, ensuring that our national policies and public financial management to promote equity, gender equality and women and girls' empowerment. We especially emphasize the following three areas today: empowering women and girls, including through capacity-building; promoting the active role of women in STEM fields; and making concrete progress in the Women, Peace and Security agenda.\nEmpowering women and girls to realize their full potential\nBuilding upon the outcomes of the past G7 Summits, the G7 Forum for Dialogue with Women and the World Assembly for Women (WAW!), we are determined to ensure women's equal rights, full and effective participation, equal pay for equal work, and equal opportunities for leadership, while calling for active engagement of the private sector, including through our efforts to promote the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) of UN Women. We also endorse the mission of the UN's High Level Panel (HLP) on Women's Economic Empowerment. We reiterate our commitment to expanding opportunities for women and girls by building their capacity including through quality education and training, and supporting women and girls to realize their full potential. To translate such commitments into actions, we endorse common guiding principles set out in the Annex, the G7 Guiding Principles for Capacity Building of Women and Girls: towards Sustainable, Inclusive and Equitable Growth and Peace, that builds on the SDGs in the area of gender equality, health and education. We invite other interested countries to join us in these commitments.\nPromoting the active role of women in STEM fields and careers\nWe recognize that a critical determinant of global competitiveness is human talent, and that promoting the active role of women in STEM fields and careers broadens the talent pool and enhances creativity and innovation which leads to economic growth and productivity. We aim to improve women's access to higher-paying jobs and to reduce gender wage gaps. Despite such benefits, while the number of women graduates in STEM fields is increasing, the share of women employed in STEM careers has shown little change in the last decade. We emphasize that, in addition to education and training, it is important to remove the gender bias that women encounter, promote institutional change and create legal and policy environments which effectively advance gender equality in those careers. In this light, we launch a G7 initiative, Women's Initiative in Developing STEM Career (WINDS), to catalyze global momentum to promote the advancement of women in STEM fields and careers, in partnership with the OECD, UNWomen, and other international agencies and stakeholders.\nMaking concrete progress in Women, Peace and Security\nWe are appalled by the increase in gender-based violence in all its forms including sexual violence, in conflict and post-conflict situations, when fleeing a conflict or when migrating, as well as during and in the aftermath of natural disasters. We therefore reaffirm the importance of tackling all forms of gender based violence including in our societies, supporting those affected and holding perpetrators to account with the aim to address the culture of impunity, while making all efforts to prevent sexual and gender-based violence. We are also committed to work with the UN and others to advance the Women, Peace and Security agenda. In this connection, we call on all states to support full implementation of the UNSG's zero tolerance policy towards sexual exploitation and of the UN Security Council resolution 2272. We highlight the importance of women's active and meaningful participation in conflict prevention and resolution, mediation, peacekeeping, humanitarian response, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction consistent with the UN Security Council resolution 1325 and its subsequent resolutions. We therefore call upon all states to implement the commitments they made at last year's UN Security Council High Level Review of SCR 1325, and remain committed to supporting efforts by other countries, both financially and technically, to establish and implement National Action Plans on Women, Peace and Security or similar gender-equality related strategies.\nMoreover, recognizing the underrepresentation of women among international conflict mediators, we commit to increasing the number of women in such positions.\nCyber\nWe strongly support an accessible, open, interoperable, reliable and secure cyberspace as one essential foundation for economic growth and prosperity. This also enhances the common values of the G7, such as freedom, democracy and respect for privacy and human rights. We will take decisive and robust measures in close cooperation against malicious use of cyberspace, both by states and non-state actors, including terrorists. We reaffirm that international law is applicable in cyberspace. We commit to promote a strategic framework of international cyber stability consisting of the applicability of existing international law to state behavior in cyberspace, the promotion of voluntary norms of responsible state behavior during peacetime, and the development and the implementation of practical cyber confidence building measures between states. In this context, we welcome the report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts in 2015 and call upon all states to be guided by the assessments and recommendations of the report. We also reaffirm that no country should conduct or knowingly support ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors. We commit to facilitate the free flow of information to ensure openness, transparency and freedom of the Internet, and a fair and equal access to the cyberspace for all actors of digital economy while respecting privacy and data protection, as well as cyber security. We commit to the protection and promotion of human rights online. We commit to promote a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance which includes full and active participation by governments, the private sector, civil society, the technical community, and international organizations, among others. We recognize that states have particular responsibilities and roles in the ICT environment, just as elsewhere to promote security, stability and prosperity. We commit to collaborate to maximize the potential of the digitally connected world, and to address global challenges, bridge digital divides, realize inclusive development, and to achieve progress on the 2030 Agenda. We endorse the G7 Principles and Actions on Cyber, as set out in the Annex to promote and protect an open, interoperable, reliable and secure cyberspace. We decide to establish a new G7 working group on cyber to enhance our policy coordination and practical cooperation to promote security and stability in cyberspace.\nAnti-Corruption\nCorruption is fundamentally contrary to our common values, in particular, the rule of law, democracy and fair competition. We reiterate that our collective and individual action to fight corruption is critical for economic growth, sustainable development and maintaining peace and security. Recognizing the magnitude of the global problem of corruption, we endorse the G7 Action to Fight Corruption, as set out in the Annex, which demonstrates our renewed commitment to fight corruption and ensure transparency worldwide. We will promote the effective implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), as well as other key international instruments such as the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and will promote full participation in their respective review mechanisms. We welcome the outcomes and the momentum created by the Anti-Corruption Summit hosted by the United Kingdom in May to galvanize action against corruption in the international community, as well as valuable initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership, the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the UN Global Compact. We commit to lead by example in moving the global anti-corruption agenda forward including in other international fora.\nForeign Policy\nCountering Terrorism and Violent Extremism\nWe strongly condemn terrorism in all forms and manifestations. The attacks, atrocities and abuses of human rights targeting civilians and other victims perpetrated by ISIL/Da'esh, Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations pose serious challenges to peace and international security, as well as to common values and principles for all humanity. We take note, with grave concern, of the growing number of terror attacks, especially those aimed at vulnerable sites due to their open access and limited security barriers as well as cultural property. The Internet and social media have been exploited throughout the world for terrorist, violent extremist and other criminal purposes, such as terrorist recruiting and financing, attack planning and coordination. Aviation security is also a global challenge that requires all countries to ensure implementation of appropriate and sustainable security measures that can evolve to respond to the terrorist threat.\nWe reiterate that it is essential for the international community to make further collective and coordinated efforts to fight this urgent global security threat. We stress the importance of continued cooperation with the private sector, civil society and communities and the \"whole-of-society\" approach. We commend the intensive counterterrorism efforts that have already been made globally, regionally, bilaterally and domestically. We emphasize the importance of filling gaps and accelerating such existing efforts and reaffirm that the G7, as a catalyst for global progress, can play a leading role in promoting effective implementation of counterterrorism measures in cooperation with the international community in a manner fully compliant with international human rights obligations. We continue to work together to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and terrorism-related materials and equipment. We reassert our commitment to countering terrorist financing as declared in the G7 Action Plan on Combatting the Financing of Terrorism at the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' meeting in Sendai.\nThe payment of ransoms to terrorist groups is one of the sources of income which supports their recruitment efforts, strengthens their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, and incentivizes future incidents of kidnapping for ransom, thereby increasing the risks to our nationals. We unequivocally reiterate our resolve not to pay ransoms to terrorists, to protect the lives of our nationals and, in accordance with relevant international conventions, to reduce terrorist groups' access to the funding that allows them to survive and thrive, and call on all states to do so.\nWe commit to promote peaceful co-existence wherever differences of opinion, culture and faith exist, respect for diversity, tolerance, and inclusive dialogue in order to break the vicious cycle of violence and hatred and to prevent the emergence and spread of violent extremism. In this regard, we welcome the UNSG's Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, call for its implementation and support a strong model of UN leadership which will deliver a genuinely whole-of-UN approach. We also stress the importance of the role of local communities, especially women and youth, as well as empowerment of alternative voices including through education and dialogue.\nWe also commit to enhance our coordination to support countries in need of building their capacity on countering terrorism and violent extremism.\nCommitting ourselves to translate these principles into concrete action, we commit to take actions as set out in the Annex, the G7 Action Plan on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism. We commit to work to support the implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions, to bolster information sharing, to strengthen border security, to improve aviation security, to counter terrorist financing, to fight against trafficking of cultural properties, to prevent and counter violent extremism, to step up our engagement with the private sector and to further coordinate our capacity building assistance. We commit to regularly take stock of the implementation of the Action Plan.\nMigration and Refugee crisis\nWith the number of refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable migrants at its highest level since the Second World War, the G7 recognizes the ongoing large scale movements of migrants and refugees as a global challenge which requires a global response, in full respect for human rights and in accordance with applicable international law. We place the highest priority on humanely and effectively managing this challenge, addressing both the humanitarian consequences and the root causes of massive displacement. Large movements of people are a multi-faceted phenomenon, which requires addressing its root causes resulting from conflicts, state fragility and insecurity, demographic, economic and environmental trends as well as natural disasters. The international community should therefore increase its efforts towards conflict prevention, stabilization, and post-conflict peacebuilding and focus on finding solutions in order to reduce poverty, promote peace, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights, support inclusive economic growth and improve the delivery of basic services.\nWe commit to increase global assistance to meet immediate and longer-term needs of refugees and other displaced persons as well as their host communities, via humanitarian, financial, and development assistance, cooperation, as well as other measures to support trade and investment consistent with our international obligations, recognizing the necessity of closer collaboration between humanitarian, development and other actors. We aim to increase the socio-economic development of affected regions, notably regarding education, health care, infrastructure, and promotion of human rights and equal opportunities. We recognize the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda regarding effective migration management, and we commit to strengthen our development cooperation with our partner countries, with special attention to African, Middle East and neighboring countries of origin and transit.\nThe G7 encourages international financial institutions and bilateral donors to bolster their financial and technical assistance for refugees and other displaced persons as well as their host communities and welcomes, in particular, the launch of New Financing Initiative to Support the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region. We also call for close coordination with existing facilities and funding mechanisms, such as the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis ('Madad Fund'), the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey, and the EU Trust Fund for Africa. We stress the importance of increasing support to the most affected host countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Kenya, and continue close cooperation with Turkey, which will help deliver the outcomes of the London Conference on Supporting Syria and the Region. The Syrian crisis has underlined the need for the international community to be better equipped to assist developing countries of all income levels and across all regions in addressing cases of protracted displacements. Increasing global support for relevant international humanitarian and emergency relief organizations, such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme, and UN Children's Rights and Emergency Relief Organization (UNICEF), is vital.\nWe call for the adoption of wide-range and long-term strategies and instruments to tackle the root causes of the surge of economic migration and refugee flows. We recognize that there is a need for tools that assist countries in providing sustainable livelihoods for refugees and other displaced persons as well as their host communities, through financing and technical advice to support access to jobs, education, health services, and basic infrastructure. Along with other World Bank shareholders, we ask the World Bank to develop a new platform that expands its toolkit to assist countries hosting refugees. We also welcome that the European Investment Bank is exploring options to develop a long-term crisis response initiative in support of sustainable growth, vital infrastructure and social cohesion in the Mediterranean region and Africa.\nLegal channels for migration will be enhanced consistently with national and regional frameworks in tandem with addressing irregular migration. The G7 encourages the temporary admission of refugees and the establishment of resettlement schemes, to alleviate pressure on countries hosting the largest numbers of refugees. Recognizing the contribution made by existing initiatives, work to expand resettlement opportunities and other forms of safe and legal humanitarian admission for refugees should continue. We commit to assist the front-line states in creating education and employment opportunities for refugees in order to empower them as future assets contributing to the stability and prosperity of host communities and the reconstruction of home countries after their return.\nThe G7 supports the strengthening of the international protection approaches through promoting the core principles of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its Protocol, and by providing safe haven for those fleeing persecution. It is also clear, however, that protection frameworks should not be used to bypass legitimate immigration assessment. To these ends, individuals fleeing persecution should be granted effective protection in the first safe country they enter, and governments should provide opportunities for safe and orderly resettlement processes as well as provide international humanitarian and development assistance for refugees, host countries and communities.\nAt the same time, we encourage cooperation with countries of origin and transit to facilitate the safe and dignified return and reintegration of migrants who are not eligible for international protection, including under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its Protocol. We are determined to continue to fight migrant smuggling and modern slavery, and protect victims of trafficking together with countries of origin, transit and destination. We call for the conclusion and full implementation of the relevant international instruments, such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols.\nFurther, we support UN-led efforts to strengthen the long-term capacity and effectiveness of the international system to respond to humanitarian crises, which includes: (i) increasing resources for humanitarian assistance, (ii) reducing reliance on humanitarian aid by investing in resilience and disaster risk reduction, and by seeking durable solutions to displacement; (iii) broadening the resource base; as well as (iv) enhancing access, efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid delivery systems. We also reiterate the importance of addressing the root causes of displacement, including human rights violations.\nThe G7 recalls that only sustainable political settlements within countries of origin, including Syria, will bring lasting solutions to the problem of forced displacement, including refugees.\nWe welcome the World Humanitarian Summit and look forward to the UN General Assembly Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants and the Leaders' Summit on Refugees in New York in September.\nDeauville Partnership\nWe reiterate our commitment to the Deauville Partnership to support the countries of the MENA in their economic and governance reform efforts.\nWe recognize the new challenges facing the Arab Countries in Transition (ACTs) including the rise of violent extremism, intensification of military conflicts, complex humanitarian crises and significant number of refugees. We emphasize the need for stability, democratization and inclusive economic growth. To that end, we underscore the importance of structural economic reforms, improved governance, the empowerment of women and robust civil society participation.\nThe Deauville Partnership remains an important platform for dialogue and cooperation with the ACTs, regional partners and relevant international institutions. We commit to promote the socio-economic role of women in the region and to convene an expert meeting on this topic. We welcome the shared commitment to implement the Deauville Compact on Economic Governance, the Action Plan for Financial Inclusion and the projects financed by the MENA Transition Fund. We recognize the importance of SME-related projects and encourage the updating of the ACT SME Action Plans. We remain committed to supporting the ACTs through country-tailored approaches.\nSyria\nWe call on all parties and their backers to fully implement the nationwide Cessation of Hostilities achieved based on the efforts taken by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG). We condemn in the strongest terms violations of the Cessation of Hostilities, especially in and around Aleppo, by the Syrian regime and reiterate that parties must cease indiscriminate attacks on civilians. We welcome the ISSG's commitment to intensifying its efforts to ensure that all parties stop any further indiscriminate attacks, and welcome Russia's commitment in the Joint Statement of May 9 2016 to 'work with the Syrian authorities to minimize aviation operations over areas predominantly inhabited by civilians or parties to the cessation'. We expect Russia and Iran to urge the regime to comply with renewed cessation and to stop its attacks directed at civilians, and urge all parties to the cessation to abide by the terms of the cessation. We urge all members of the international community and parties to the conflict to fully implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions, particularly 2254, 2258 and 2268 to support the efforts by the UN Special Envoy, and to commit to an inclusive and peaceful political transition in Syria based on the Geneva Communiqué. We welcome the ISSG's clear reiteration of the objective that, by the target date of August 1 2016 as established by UN Security Council resolution 2254, the parties reach agreement on a framework for a genuine political transition, which would include a broad, inclusive, non-sectarian transitional governing body with full executive powers.\nWe express our grave concern at the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and call on all parties, notably the Syrian regime, to immediately allow humanitarian agencies rapid, safe, unhindered and sustained access in Syria, in particular the besieged areas and hard to reach places, as well as to release all arbitrarily detained persons, including women and children. We welcome the ISSG's commitment that, starting June 1 2016, if the UN is denied humanitarian access to any of the designated besieged areas, the World Food Program should immediately carry out a program of air bridges and air drops for all areas in need. We are committed to supporting displaced persons and their host communities and to working towards a long-term, sustainable post-conflict stabilization and rehabilitation of Syria and to eradicating conditions conducive to violent extremism.\nWe express grave concern over the findings of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) regarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Practical and political support for the OPCW and for the UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism is essential to identify and hold to account those involved in chemical weapons use in Syria.\nIraq\nWe commit our continued support for the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and the Iraqi people, as well as the Iraqi government's efforts to accelerate political and economic reforms and enhance national reconciliation. We commend Iraqi forces' efforts in their fight against ISIL/Da'esh. We call on the international community to continue to support the government of Iraq, including by extending humanitarian assistance and supporting stabilization efforts in areas liberated from ISIL/Da'esh. We also commit to provide, and expedite as appropriate, support for Iraq's efforts to address its fiscal challenge and strengthen its economy through reforms, in coordination with the IMF and other international financial institutions. It is critical that all Iraqis, including the Iraqi Kurdistan region, benefit from this support. In this context, the G7 is mobilizing more than 3.6 billion USD in bilateral assistance and other financial support to complement support from the international financial institutions.\nIran\nWe reaffirm our commitment to actively support the full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The lifting of nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions as provided for in the JCPOA represents an opportunity for Iran to reengage with the global community. We call on Iran to play a constructive role in its region and thus contribute to the efforts to achieve political solutions, reconciliation and peace, and cooperate to prevent and counter the spread of terrorism and violent extremism. We are deeply concerned by Iran's decision to proceed with the testing of ballistic missiles inconsistent with UN Security Council resolution 2231. We further call on Iran to comply with its international human rights obligations.\nNorth Korea\nWe condemn in the strongest terms North Korea's nuclear test in January and its subsequent launches using ballistic missile technology. These acts violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and pose a grave threat to regional and international peace and security. We demand that North Korea immediately and fully comply with all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and its commitments under the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, and not conduct any further nuclear tests, launches, or engage in any other destabilizing or provocative actions. We call on the international community to fully implement and enforce relevant UN Security Council resolutions. We also deplore the human rights violations in North Korea and strongly urge North Korea to immediately address the international community's concerns, including the abductions issue.\nUkraine/Russia\nWe stand united in our conviction that the conflict in Ukraine can only be solved by diplomatic means and in full respect for international law, especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We reiterate our condemnation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia and reaffirm our policy of its non-recognition and sanctions against those involved.\nWe are concerned by continued violence along the line of contact in violation of the ceasefire; we urge all sides to take concrete steps that will lead to the complete ceasefire required under the Minsk agreements. We also urge all sides to fulfill their commitments without delay with a view to holding local elections in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as soon as possible in accordance with the Minsk agreements. We emphasize our strongest support for full implementation of the Minsk agreements and the work of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. We expect Russia to live up to its commitments and use its influence over the separatists to meet their commitments in full. We stress the OSCE's key role in helping to deescalate the crisis, and we call upon all sides, particularly the separatists, to provide the organization's monitors full and unfettered access throughout the conflict zone.\nWe recall that the duration of sanctions is clearly linked to Russia's complete implementation of the Minsk agreements and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty. Sanctions can be rolled back when Russia meets these commitments. However, we also stand ready to take further restrictive measures in order to increase cost on Russia should its actions so require. We recognize the importance of maintaining dialogue with Russia in order to ensure it abides by the commitments it has made as well as international law and to reach a comprehensive, sustainable and peaceful solution to the crisis.\nWe commend and support the steps Ukraine is taking to implement comprehensive structural, governance and economic reforms and encourage Ukraine to continue and accelerate the process. We urge Ukraine to maintain and enhance the momentum in its fight against corruption and its judicial reform, including the Prosecutor General's office. We are fully committed to providing long-term support to this end. We also commend the work of the Ukraine support group of G7 Ambassadors in Kyiv.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to undertake joint efforts with Ukraine to convert the Chernobyl site into a stable and environmentally safe condition, 30 years after the catastrophe.\nLibya\nWe welcome the decree of the Presidential Council authorizing the ministers of the Government of National Accord (GNA) to assume duties and take control over their ministries, pending the taking of the official oath. We will work closely with the GNA as the sole legitimate government of Libya and call on all Libyan parties to recognize its authority and implement the Libyan Political Agreement. We stand ready to offer support to the GNA to help restore peace, security and prosperity, and address the dire humanitarian suffering. We express our full support to United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General Kobler's continued efforts to facilitate the full implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement. We remain deeply concerned about the growing terrorist threat, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants and arms in Libya. We urge all Libyan parties and security forces to work quickly to implement a unified command in coordination with the GNA and in accordance with the Libyan Political Agreement to fight ISIL/Da'esh. We support the sole and effective oversight of the GNA over the Libyan financial institutions and the Libyan National Oil Corporation, ensuring that they function for the benefit of all Libyans. We express concern about activities which could damage the integrity and unity of such institutions, and condemn all attempts to illicitly export crude oil from Libya. We reaffirm our commitment to upholding the arms embargo, in accordance with applicable UN Security Council resolutions while fully supporting the GNA's intention to submit appropriate arms embargo exemption requests to the UN Libya Sanctions Committee to procure necessary lethal arms and materiel to counter UN-designated terrorist groups and to combat ISIL/Da'esh throughout the country.\nAfghanistan\nWe stand firm in our longstanding commitment to Afghanistan and its people and our continuing support for the government, as it counters terrorism and undertakes reforms. We remain concerned by the threat to security and stability in Afghanistan, and strongly support efforts toward establishing an Afghan-led peace process. We look forward to joining other members of the international community at the NATO Warsaw Summit in July and the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan in October which will be important opportunities for Afghanistan to reconfirm its commitments toward continued reforms, and for the international community to renew political, security and development assistance commitments to Afghanistan.\nMiddle East Peace Process\nWe urge both sides to avoid further escalation, including measures which could threaten the two-state solution and strongly support international efforts to work towards a negotiated solution including the efforts undertaken by the Middle East Quartet. We welcome the upcoming ministerial conference in Paris.\nYemen\nWe call on all parties to work towards an inclusive, peaceful solution that will end the conflict in Yemen, including a resumption of the political transition, in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the rebuilding of the Yemeni economy. We fully support the efforts of UN Envoy for Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed to facilitate ongoing peace talks in Kuwait, to end the violence in Yemen and to urge all parties to comply fully with the ceasefire. We underline the necessity of all parties taking immediate steps to enable rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all areas of the country.\nAfrica\nWe are convinced that stability, security, inclusive and accountable governance, as well as economic growth and diversification remain the foundations of long-term prosperity and sustainable development in Africa. We recognize the strides made by many African partners in these areas and welcome the successful political transitions in the Central African Republic and in Burkina Faso, as well as the recent positive developments in Mali and South Sudan. We also welcome the growing coordination between African partners to counter terrorism and violent extremism, especially in the Lake Chad Basin, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. We commit to sustain and deepen the support we pledged to Nigeria in 2015, including on its efforts to tackle corruption, improve governance, strengthen its economy, and defeat violent extremism in all its forms. We also recognize the need to address both the immediate and the root causes of current challenges and the significant obstacles that remain, including persistent instability and serious humanitarian situations in Sudan, the Lake Chad Basin, South Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and Burundi as well as corruption and the lack of economic diversification in the region. We thus continue to support African and regional organizations' efforts to address these issues, including to prevent and resolve conflicts, strengthen democratic institutions, fight against trafficking in persons, manage irregular migration, combat the illicit transfer of conventional arms, create jobs for the youth, expose and tackle corruption, and promote sustainable development and resilience, emphasizing the importance of African ownership of these efforts. We continue to assist the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and support the development of the Somali security forces. We also reaffirm our commitment to combating illicit wildlife trafficking and, recognizing the urgency of the situation, further reaffirm our previous commitment to the Resolution 69/314 adopted at the UN General Assembly.\nVenezuela\nWe call on the Venezuelan government to fully respect fundamental rights, democratic processes, freedoms and the rule of law to provide access to fair trials and due process, and to establish conditions that would allow for dialogue between the government and its citizens, in order for them to find a peaceful means of resolving Venezuela's increasingly acute economic and political crisis, while respecting the will of the people. We call on the Venezuelan executive branch and the National Assembly to work urgently together to this end.\nMaritime Security\nWe reiterate our commitment to maintaining a rules-based maritime order in accordance with the principles of international law as reflected in UNCLOS, to peaceful dispute settlement supported by confidence building measures and including through legal means as well as to sustainable uses of the seas and oceans, and to respecting freedom of navigation and overflight. We reaffirm the importance of states' making and clarifying their claims based on international law, refraining from unilateral actions which could increase tensions and not using force or coercion in trying to drive their claims, and seeking to settle disputes by peaceful means including through juridical procedures including arbitration.\nWe reaffirm the importance of strengthening maritime safety and security, in particular the fight against piracy, through international and regional cooperation.\nWe are concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas, and emphasize the fundamental importance of peaceful management and settlement of disputes.\nWe endorse the G7 Foreign Ministers' Statement on Maritime Security.\nNon-Proliferation and Disarmament\nWe reaffirm that non-proliferation and disarmament issues are among our top priorities. We reaffirm our commitment to seeking a safer world for all and to creating the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons in a way that promotes international stability. In this context, we endorse the G7 Foreign Ministers' Hiroshima Declaration on Nuclear Disarmament and Non-Proliferation and the Statement of the G7 Non-Proliferation Directors Group on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. We remain committed to the universalization of the treaties and conventions relevant to, amongst others, preventing and combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\nUN Reform and UN Peace Operations Review\nWe reaffirm the importance and necessity of realizing a strengthened, more effective and efficient United Nations and, to this end, note the importance of continued engagement on reforms of the United Nations, such as of the Security Council.\nWe also support the ongoing reform processes on UN peace operations and peacebuilding activities, and call for further efforts to advance these processes by Member States, the UN system and relevant international and regional partners. We welcome and urge timely implementation of the pledges made at the Leaders' Summit on Peacekeeping.\nHuman Rights\nWe commit our support to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all people, peaceful pluralism and respect for diversity. We recall that compliance with obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law is a cornerstone for peace and security. We reaffirm the importance of the independent voice of human rights defenders and other civil society actors, as well as of partnerships between states and civil society in the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedom.\nNuclear Safety and Security\nWe welcome the report of the Nuclear Safety and Security Group. Five years after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, we reaffirm our commitment to achieving and maintaining the highest levels of nuclear safety worldwide and call upon all states with nuclear power programs and every stakeholder engaged in international nuclear cooperation including transfers to promote robust safety standards and infrastructures. In this regard, full participation in multilateral cooperation frameworks for nuclear safety, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety, is essential and we call upon all stakeholders for their active engagement and continued enhancement of these frameworks. We also welcome the successful outcome of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. We will continue to prioritize the security of nuclear and other radioactive materials and will work to further strengthen the global nuclear security architecture. We will also continue our political exchanges on nuclear security, in particular at the ministerial-level IAEA International Conference on Nuclear Security.\nClimate Change, Energy, Environment\nClimate Change\nWelcoming the historic achievement in Paris, we reaffirm not only our continuous commitment in our global efforts against climate change, but also our determination to maintain the momentum of COP21 and ensure swift and successful implementation of the Paris Agreement including the long-term aims on mitigation, adaptation, and finance. In this context, we welcome the fact that nearly every party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has signed the Paris Agreement, including all G7 members. The G7, continuing to take a leadership role, commits to taking the necessary steps to secure ratification, acceptance or approval of the agreement as soon as possible and calls on all Parties to do so striving for a goal of entry into force in 2016.\nWe commit to take the lead by early, transparent and robust implementation of our nationally determined contributions, and promoting increased ambition over time. We also commit to actively participate in the regular review of global stock-take progress every five years.\nWe also commit to formulating and communicating mid-century long-term low GHG emission development strategies well ahead of the 2020 deadline, mindful of the significance of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and of pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels as well as of achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of the century.\nWe encourage all Parties to engage constructively in technical work with a view to agreeing upon detailed rules for the effective and transparent implementation of the Paris Agreement by all countries, including by the major emitters.\nRecognizing that we, together with other donor countries, are making steady progress toward achieving the goal of jointly mobilizing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, we continue our efforts to provide and mobilize increased climate finance from public and private sources. We encourage other countries to provide or continue to provide and mobilize climate finance, to assist developing countries with respect to mitigation and adaptation and to implement their national climate plans (NDCs). We welcome the commitments made by MDBs and development finance institutions to deliver increased levels of climate finance. We call on MDBs and development financial institutions to mainstream climate change actions across development strategies and use to the fullest extent possible their balance sheets and their capacity to mobilize private financing and other partners in support of country-led programs to meet this goal. In the context of this goal, we also emphasize our continuous commitment of mobilizing finance and promoting the transfer of appropriate technology and capacity-building to support adaptation planning and actions in the most vulnerable developing countries in response to their growing needs. We welcome the progress to date and are ready to further promote the relevant initiatives on climate risk insurance, early warning systems and renewable energy in Africa, such as InsuResilience, CREWS and the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. We further welcome the involvement of the private sector, subnational entities, and others through the Lima-Paris Action Agenda. We recognize that innovation is critical for an effective, long-term global response to our shared climate challenge, and intend to play a leading role in Mission Innovation. We also welcome the leadership of the private sector community in this regard. We recognize the important role of providing incentives for emission reduction activities, including tools such as domestic policies and carbon pricing. We welcome the establishment of the Carbon Market Platform and its first strategic dialogue to be held in Tokyo.\nRecognizing the urgent need for effective efforts in the field of international aviation, we express our strong commitment to work together for the adoption of a Global Market-Based Measure (GMBM) in order to enable carbon neutral growth from 2020, through engaging constructive dialogue, by reaching a decision at the 39th session of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly. We encourage all world leaders to join us in supporting a decision later this year.\nWe also recognize the importance of mitigating emissions of short-lived climate pollutants including black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and methane to help slow the rate of near-term warming. In particular, we resolve to drive down our methane emissions and further recognize the importance of adopting domestic measures.\nWe welcome the decision in Dubai by the Montreal Protocol parties to work to address HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, and we support adoption of an ambitious Montreal Protocol HFC phase-down amendment in 2016, and intend to provide additional support through the Multilateral Fund following adoption of an amendment for its implementation.\nGiven the fact that energy production and use account for around two-thirds of global GHG emissions, we recognize the crucial role that the energy sector has to play in combatting climate change. We remain committed to the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and encourage all countries to do so by 2025.\nEnergy\nEnergy plays a crucial role in sustaining global economic growth. With this in mind, we commit to play a leading role in facilitating energy investments, and encourage relevant stakeholders, despite the increased uncertainty posed by the current energy price levels, to sustain their investments in energy sector, in particular in quality energy infrastructure and in upstream development, so that we can mitigate risks to future growth of global economy. We recognize the important role that the energy system has to play in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In this regard, we are determined to accelerate our work towards the transition to an energy system that enables a decarbonization of the global economy. We reiterate our strong support for Mission Innovation and commit to further investments in supporting innovation in energy technologies and encouraging clean and energy efficient products, facilities and buildings, so as to ensure economic growth with reduced GHG emissions. We support the enhanced efforts on energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, including hydro, as well as other domestic resources.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to continuing the implementations of the energy security principles and actions decided in Brussels in 2014 and Schloss Elmau in 2015, and endorse the Kitakyushu Initiative on Energy Security for Global Growth, as well as welcome the progresses achieved in collaboration with partners including the International Energy Agency (IEA). We welcome the concrete actions to strengthen energy security for natural gas, both pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG), including Japan's Strategy for LNG Market Development, the EU Strategy for LNG and gas storage and the gas security plan by the IEA. We reaffirm our commitment to continuous efforts in enhancing well-functioning natural gas markets with greater transparency and flexibility, including relaxation of destination clauses, development of price indices and building sufficient and resilient infrastructure with open access, as well as furthering a strategic view of the LNG supply chain at a global level. We also commit to our continuous work on enhancing cybersecurity in energy sector and strengthening our cooperation in the field of electricity security.\nIn the context of the ongoing crisis between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, we reiterate that energy should not be used as a means of political coercion or as a threat to security. We welcome the substantial energy policy reforms ongoing in Ukraine, and strongly urge it to pursue further ambitious reform of its energy sector. We also call for enhanced cooperation between the Ukrainian national gas transmission system operator and relevant international peers.\nWe welcome the steady progress on decommissioning and treatment of contaminated water at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, and Japan's efforts to proceed in an open and transparent manner in close communication with the international community, towards developing accurate global understanding of the situation in Fukushima. In those countries that opt to use nuclear energy, it substantially contributes to the reduction of future GHG emissions and works as a base load energy source. In those countries it is also crucially important to engage the public in science-based dialogue and transparency to inform policymaking. We call upon all countries that opt to use nuclear power to ensure the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation including an independent and effective regulator, and to exchange their expertise and experiences. We welcome the mutual cooperation and information exchange through international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Nuclear Energy Agency, and the World Association of Nuclear Operators.\nResource Efficiency and the 3Rs\nAchieving the sustainable management and efficient use of resources is addressed in the 2030 Agenda and is crucial for the protection of the environment, climate and planet. Having in mind the importance of sustainable materials management and material cycle societies, we endorse the Toyama Framework on Material Cycle. This new framework provides a common vision and a guide for future actions to deepen our efforts on resource efficiency and the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). We will continue to cooperate through the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency. We will work with business and other stakeholders to improve resource efficiency with the aim of also fostering innovation, competitiveness, economic growth and job creation. We encourage all countries to join us in these efforts.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to address marine litter, recognizing that our efforts on resource efficiency and the 3Rs also contribute to the prevention and reduction of marine litter, particularly plastic, from land-based sources. Furthermore, we support scientific work to enhance global ocean observation and assessment for the science-based management, conservation and sustainable use of marine resources.\nDevelopment The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nThe year 2015 marked the dawn of a new era in our approach to poverty reduction and sustainable development in all countries, with the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda, together with the Paris Agreement and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This agenda integrates in a balanced manner the three dimensions of sustainable development—environmental, social and economic—and applies universally to all countries. Reflecting the international community's unwavering resolve to end poverty and transform the world into a sustainable one by 2030, leaving no one behind, the 2030 Agenda lays the foundation for a more peaceful, stable, inclusive and prosperous international community. To this end, we emphasize the integrated and indivisible nature of the 17 SDGs, being well aware that peace and security, development and respect for human rights are inter-linked and mutually reinforcing, and commit to advance the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, domestically and internationally, in a people-centered and planet-sensitive manner. We urge all countries and stakeholders to engage in this joint endeavor under a revitalized and enhanced global partnership to ensure a multi-stakeholder approach.\nWe are determined to take ambitious domestic action in order to contribute substantially to the global transition to sustainable economies. In addition to our domestic actions, we commit to support developing countries' efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda, with a particular emphasis on the dignity of individuals in vulnerable groups and promoting human security. Important elements in our collective response include: the empowerment of all women and girls and gender equality, global health, quality infrastructure investment, support for youth in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in particular, revitalized response to threats to peace and security, tackling forced displacement and modern slavery, industrial human resource development and inclusive innovation; food security and nutrition, the CONNEX initiative; support for disaster risk reduction including through World Tsunami Awareness Day, support for climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy security and sustainable energy, resource efficiency and 3Rs including addressing marine litter, sustainable forest management and eliminating illegal logging. We also welcome the World Humanitarian Summit.\nWe affirm our strong commitment to the timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development which is an integral part of the 2030 agenda, working in partnership with all stakeholders. Amongst priorities, we highlight the primary importance of domestic resource mobilization and of the creation of a favorable climate capable of stimulating domestic and external private investment, while also reaffirming the essential role that official development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF) play as a catalyst for, and complement to, other sources of financing for development. In this regard, we are resolved to continue pursuing innovative partnerships and financing arrangements to advance sustainable development. We also reiterate our respective ODA commitments, such as the 0.7% ODA/GNI target, as well as our commitment to reverse the declining trend of ODA to the LDCs and to better target ODA towards countries where the needs are greatest.\nWe affirm that addressing challenges in Africa is central to the realization of the SDGs, recognizing that security, development, climate change and gender equality are interdependent and instrumental to ensuring a prosperous and peaceful Africa. As such, we stand ready to support the promotion of Africa's development aspirations as described in Agenda 2063 and its First-Ten Year Implementation Plan in partnership with the African Union and its members. We do so including through our bilateral and multilateral partnerships with African countries including the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), the Italy-Africa Ministerial Conference, EU-Africa partnership and the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. We affirm that TICAD VI to be held on 27 and 28 August, 2016 in Nairobi, Kenya, for the first time in Africa comes at a critical juncture of translating the global vision into actions for Africa.\nFood Security and Nutrition\nEnding hunger and malnutrition is a fundamental element of the 2030 Agenda. As part of a broader effort to achieve the SDGs, we commit to engage collectively in concrete actions in collaboration with relevant partners and stakeholders towards the achievement of our aim to lift 500 million people in developing countries out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030.\nBuilding on the G7 Broad Food Security and Nutrition Development Approach, we endorse the G7 Vision for Action on Food Security and Nutrition, which outlines collective actions in the priority areas of: (i) empowering women; (ii) improving nutrition through a people-centered approach that recognizes the diverse food security challenges people face across the rural to urban spectrum; and (iii) ensuring sustainability and resilience within agriculture and food systems. We commit to enhance synergies with relevant international initiatives.\nWe support the development of good practices for global food security and nutrition that are in line with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change. This could include expanding farming opportunities, revitalizing rural communities, and enhancing production, productivity, responsible investment, trade and sustainability in agriculture and food systems.\nWe welcome the International Symposium on Food Security and Nutrition to be held in Japan and the Nutrition for Growth Summit.\nCONNEX\nWe commit to intensify our efforts under the CONNEX Initiative, to provide developing country partners with multi-disciplinary and concrete expertise for negotiating complex commercial contracts, focusing initially on the extractives sector. The current downturn in commodity price underlines the importance of negotiating good contracts to help developing countries secure fair revenues from their natural resources. We endorse the CONNEX Guiding Principles towards Sustainable Development, designed to facilitate the mobilization of domestic resources in developing countries, contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. We commit to align CONNEX with existing initiatives to build capacity in developing countries and to improve governance and transparency in extractives sectors. Further progress will be sought in close partnership with relevant stakeholders including through the Negotiation Support Forum established with the OECD and the CONNEX International Conference on Capacity Building and Transparency to be held in Tokyo.\nG7 Accountability\nWe remain committed to holding ourselves to account, in an open and transparent way, for the promises we have made. We welcome the Ise-Shima Progress Report—the third comprehensive report on our development-related commitments. The Report highlights the important contribution that the G7 is making to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Positive achievements are seen in areas such as Health, Food Security, Education and Governance. We will continue to monitor progress against our commitments.\nConclusion We look forward to meeting under the Presidency of Italy in 2017.", "timestamp": "2016-05-27", "title": "Joint Statement—Group of Seven Ise-Shima Leaders' Declaration"}

Right now there are American troops serving in harm's way and standing sentry around the world. There are veterans who have served honorably in times of war and peace and often came home bearing the invisible and visible wounds of war. They may not speak the loudest about their patriotism; they let their actions do that. And the right time to think of these men and women, and thank them for their service and sacrifice, is every day of the year.\nMemorial Day, which we'll observe Monday, is different. It's the day we remember those who never made it home, those who never had the chance to take off the uniform and be honored as a veteran. It's the day we stop to reflect with gratitude on the sacrifice of generations who made us more prosperous and free and to think of the loved ones they left behind. Remembering them—searing their stories and their contributions into our collective memory—that's an awesome responsibility. It's one that all of us share as citizens.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no more solemn obligation than leading our men and women in uniform: making sure they have what they need to succeed, making sure we only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary. And if they make the ultimate sacrifice—if they give their very lives—we have to do more than honor their memory.\nWe have to be there for their families. Over the years, Michelle and I have spent quiet moments with the families of the fallen—husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters. They've shared their pain, but also their pride in the sacrifices their loved ones made under our proud flag.\nIt's up to the rest of us to live our lives in a way that's worthy of these sacrifices. The idea to set aside a Memorial Day each year didn't come from our Government, it came from ordinary citizens who acknowledged that while we can't build monuments to every heroic act of every warrior we lost in battle, we can keep their memories alive by taking one day out of the year to decorate the places where they're buried.\nThat's something that so many of our fellow Americans are doing this weekend: remembering. Remembering the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen who died in our defense. Remembering those who remain missing. Remembering that they were our fellow citizens and churchgoers, classmates and children, and more often than not, the best of us.\nSo this Memorial weekend, I hope you'll join me in acts of remembrance. Lay a flower or plant a flag at a fallen hero's final resting place. Reach out to a Gold Star family in your community and listen to the story they have to tell. Send a care package to our troops overseas, volunteer to make a wounded warrior's day a little easier. Or hire a veteran who is ready and willing to serve at home just as they did abroad. Or just pause, take a moment, and offer a silent word of prayer or a public word of thanks.\nThe debt we owe our fallen heroes is one we can never truly repay. But our responsibility to remember is something we can live up to every day of the year. Thanks. May God watch over our fallen heroes and their families, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-05-28", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Bernie Sanders on Saturday crisscrossed Southern California with rallies at Santa Barbara, Santa Maria and here at the Kern County Fairgrounds.\nAiming to speak to more than 200,000 Californians during the month before the June 7 presidential primary election, Sanders already was more than half-way to that goal after he 6,000 supports sprawled across a lawn at the coastline campus of Santa Barbara City College, 7,500 sat in the blazing sun at the Santa Maria High School football field and 4,100 packed the fairgrounds grandstands in Bakersfield at the southern end of California's Central Valley.\nIn a tightening California contest with Hillary Clinton, Sanders already has won primaries and caucuses in 20 states. He said a win in the Golden State with its prize of 475 pledged delegates would give his grassroots campaign a big boost heading into this summer's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \"We're going to go in with momentum and we're going to come out with the Democratic nomination,\" Sanders said.\nHe also taunted Donald Trump for his on-again, off-again response to Sanders' challenge to debate in California. Trump had twice agreed to debate Sanders but then backed down.\n\"You're a big macho guy,\" Sanders said of Trump. \"If you have any guts come on down and let's debate the issues.\"\nSanders proposed a televised encounter with the Republican Party presidential nominee after Clinton reneged on her agreement to debate Sanders in California in May.\nBefore the sunset rally here in Bakersfield, Sanders met with Latino community leaders and residents for a discussion of immigration reform, farmworkers' rights and other issues.\n\"It is very clear to me that we have a broken immigration system and we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship,\" Sanders said at the meeting at the Kern County Fairgrounds. \"The goal should be to unite families, not divide families.\"\nThe Vermont senator also fielded questions about dilapidated housing and the health consequences of pesticide exposure and groundwater contamination.\n\"I don't believe there is any member of the Congress with a stronger pro-labor voting record. I've been on more picket lines than I can recall,\" Sanders said.\nHe also recited his work on behalf of farm workers laboring under \"deplorable\" circumstances in Immokalee, Florida. Sanders traveled there in 2008 and based on that first-hand experience he later chaired a Senate hearing into how the agricultural industry was taking advantage of workers who were denied decent wages, decent working conditions and decent housing.", "timestamp": "2016-05-29", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Draws Big Crowds at Southern California Rallies"}

Bernie Sanders on Monday called Hillary Clinton's shifting positions on critical issues facing Puerto Rico \"too little, too late.\"\n\"As has happened many times before, Secretary Clinton has changed her mind and is inching closer to positions I have taken,\" Sanders said, \"but what she says only days before Election Day in Puerto Rico is too little, too late.\"\nClinton had supported a controversial bill in the U.S. House of Representatives to establish a control board stacked with Republican congressional appointees which could impose harsh austerity measures to deal with Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt. After Sanders came out against the bill, Clinton now has voiced vague reservations about the measure.\nOn another important issue, Sanders was the first presidential candidate to call for the release from prison of Oscar Lopez Rivera, an ailing 73-year-old political prisoner. Now, one week before Puerto Rico's presidential primary, she says she would \"evaluate the case.\" Sanders said, \"I am glad that she wants to review the case of Oscar Lopez Rivera but the time for review is over. Oscar Lopez Rivera should be freed.\"\nWhat to do about Puerto Rico's debt is perhaps the key immediate issue. While Clinton's posture is shifting, Sanders has been a clear and outspoken opponent of the disastrous House Republican plan to impose an unelected control board that could slash pensions, close hospitals, fire teachers, raise taxes and privatize government assets without any input from the island's 3.5 million American residents.\nClinton now says Puerto Ricans should \"have a voice in any oversight board.\" Sanders position is clearer and stronger. \"I am glad she is taking a new look at the control board but this is too little, too late,\" Sanders said.\nSanders said he will soon introduce legislation that would allow Puerto Rico's debt to be restructured in a way that protects pensions and ordinary investors. His legislation will make it clear that the Federal Reserve has the authority to facilitate an orderly restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt. It also would provide emergency assistance to Puerto Rico to create jobs, reduce the poverty rate and end the territory's reliance on dirty fossil fuels.", "timestamp": "2016-05-30", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Calls Clinton Plans for Puerto Rico 'Too Little, Too Late'"}

Good morning.\nAudience members. Good morning.\nThe President. Secretary Carter, General Dunford, Mr. Hallinan, Major General Becker, members of our Armed Forces, veterans, and most of all, our Gold Star families: I'm honored to be with you once again as we pay our respects, as Americans, to those who gave their lives for us all.\nHere at Arlington, the deafening sounds of combat have given way to the silence of these sacred hills. The chaos and confusion of battle has yielded to perfect, precise rows of peace. The Americans who rest here and their families—the best of us, those from whom we asked everything—ask of us today only one thing in return: that we remember them.\nIf you look closely at the white markers that grace these hills, one thing you'll notice is that so many of the years—dates of birth and dates of death—are so close together. They belong to young Americans, those who never lived to be honored as veterans for their service: men who battled their own brothers in Civil War, those who fought as a band of brothers an ocean away, and men and women who redefine heroism for a new generation. There are generals buried beside privates they led. Americans known as dad or mom, some only known to God. As Mr. Hallinan, a marine who then watched over these grounds, has said, \"Everyone here is someone's hero.\"\nThose who rest beneath this silence—not only here at Arlington, but at veterans' cemeteries across our country and around the world and all who still remain missing—they didn't speak the loudest about their patriotism. They let their actions do that. Whether they stood up in times of war, signed up in times of peace, or were called up by a draft board, they embodied the best of America.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no greater responsibility than leading our men and women in uniform; I have no more solemn obligation sending them into harm's way. I think about this every time I approve an operation as President; every time, as a husband and father, that I sign a condolence letter; every time Michelle and I sit at the bedside of a wounded warrior or grieve and hug members of a Gold Star Family.\nLess than 1 percent of our Nation wears the uniform, and so few Americans sees this patriotism with their own eyes or knows someone who exemplifies it. But every day, there are American families who pray for the sound of a familiar voice when the phone rings, for the sound of a loved one's letter or e-mail arriving. More than 1 million times in our history, it didn't come. And instead, a car pulled up to the house. And there was a knock on the front door. And the sounds of \"Taps\" floated through a cemetery's trees.\nFor us, the living—those of us who still have a voice—it is our responsibility, our obligation, to fill that silence with our love and our support and our gratitude, and not just with our words, but with our actions. For truly remembering and truly honoring these fallen Americans means being there for their parents and their spouses and their children, like the boys and girls here today, wearing red shirts and bearing photos of the fallen. Your moms and dads would be so proud of you. And we are too.\nTruly remembering means that after our fallen heroes gave everything to get their battle buddies home, we have to make sure our veterans get everything that they have earned, from good health care to a good job. And we have to do better; our work is never done. We have to be there not only when we need them, but when they need us.\nThirty days before he would be laid to rest a short walk from here, President Kennedy told us that a nation reveals itself not only by the people it produces, but by those it remembers. Not everyone will serve. Not everyone will visit this national sanctuary. But we remember our best in every corner of our country from which they came. We remember them by teaching our children at schools with fallen heroes' names, like Dorie Miller Elementary in San Antonio. Or being good neighbors in communities named after great generals, like McPherson, Kansas. Or when we walk down First Sergeant Bobby Mendez Way in Brooklyn or drive across the Hoover Dam on a bridge that bears Pat Tillman's name.\nWe reveal ourselves in our words and deeds, but also by the simple act of listening. My fellow Americans, today and every day, listen to the stories these Gold Star families and veterans have to tell. Ask about who he or she was, why they volunteered. Hear from those who loved them about what their smile looked like and their laugh sounded like and the dreams they had for their lives.\nSince we gathered here 1 year ago, more than 20 brave Americans have given their lives for the security of our people in Afghanistan. And we pray for them all and for their families. In Iraq, in our fight against ISIL, three Americans have given their lives in combat on our behalf. And today I ask you to remember their stories as well.\nCharles Keating IV—Charlie or Chuck or \"C-4\"—was born into a family of veterans, All-American athletes, and Olympians, even a Gold Medalist. So, naturally, Charlie, and the love of his life, Brooke, celebrated their anniversary on the Fourth of July. She called him the \"huge goofball\" everybody wanted to be friends with: the adventurer who surfed and spearfished and planned to sail around the world.\nWhen the Twin Towers fell, he was in high school, and he decided to enlist; joined the SEALs because, he told his friends, it was the hardest thing to do. He deployed to Afghanistan and three times to Iraq, earning a Bronze Star for valor. And earlier this month, while assisting local forces in Iraq who had come under attack, he gave his life.\nA few days later, one of his platoon mates sent Charlie's parents a letter from Iraq. \"Please tell everyone Chuck saved a lot of lives today,\" it said. He left us \"with that big signature smile on his handsome face, as always. Chuck was full of aloha, but was also a ferocious warrior.\" Today we honor Chief Special Warfare Officer Charles Keating IV.\nLouis Cardin was the sixth of seven children, a Californian with an infectious wit who always had a joke at the ready to help someone get through a tough time. When his siblings ran around the house as kids, his mom Pat would yell after them: \"Watch that baby's safety margin!\" And today, she realizes that what she was really doing was raising a marine. As a teenager, he proudly signed up. Louie graduated high school on a Friday. Three days later, on Monday morning, the marines came to pick him up. That was 10 years ago. One morning this March, a marine knocked on his mother's door again. On his fifth tour, at a fire base in Iraq, Louie gave his life while protecting the marines under his command. Putting others before himself was what Louie did best. He chose to live in the barracks with his buddies even when he could have taken a house off base. He volunteered to babysit for friends who needed a date night. He'd just earned a promotion to mentor his fellow marines. When they brought Louie home, hundreds of strangers lined freeway overpasses and the streets of Southern California to salute him. And today we salute Staff Sergeant Louie Cardin.\nJoshua Wheeler's sister says he was \"exactly what was right about this world. He came from nothing and he really made something of himself.\" As a kid, Josh was the one who made sure his brother and four half-sisters were dressed and fed and off to school. When there wasn't food in the cupboard, he grabbed his hunting rifle and came back with a deer for dinner. When his country needed him, he enlisted in the Army at age 19.\nHe deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan 14 times, earned 11 Bronze Stars, four for valor. Last October, as ISIL terrorists prepared to execute 70 hostages, Josh and his fellow Special Ops went in and rescued them. Every single one walked free. \"We were already dead,\" one of the hostages said, \"then God sent us a force from the sky.\" That force was the U.S. Army, including Josh Wheeler.\nJosh was the doting dad who wrote notes to his kids in the stacks of books he read. Flying home last summer to be with his wife Ashley who was about to give birth, he scribbled one note in the novel he was reading, just to tell his unborn son he was on his way. Ashley Wheeler is with us here today, holding their 10-month-old son David. Ashley says Josh's memory makes her think about how can she be a better citizen. And she hopes it's what other people think about too. Today, this husband and father rests here, in Arlington, in Section 60. And as Americans, we resolve to be better—better people, better citizens—because of Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler.\nA nation reveals itself not only by the people it produces, but by those it remembers. We do so not just by hoisting a flag, but by lifting up our neighbors. Not just by pausing in silence, but by practicing in our own lives the ideals of opportunity and liberty and equality that they fought for. We can serve others and contribute to the causes they believed in and, above all, keep their stories alive so that one day, when he grows up and thinks of his dad, an American like David Wheeler can tell them, as well, the stories of the lives that others gave for all of us.\nWe are so proud of them. We are so grateful for their sacrifice. We are so thankful to those families of the fallen. May God bless our fallen and their families. May He bless all of you. And may He forever bless these United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-05-30", "title": "Remarks at a Memorial Day Ceremony in Arlington, Virginia"}

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday said it was time for the United States to join every other major industrialized nation and provide better health care at lower cost to all Americans.\n\"Embarrassingly, the United States today is the only country on earth that does not guarantee health care as a right for all people,\" Sanders told a rally. \"We need to guarantee health care for all people as a right.\"\nSanders said the United States spends far more per capita on health care than any other nation; twice as much as in Great Britain and half again as much as in France. In the United States, meanwhile nearly 60 million Americans either do not have health insurance or are underinsured and cannot afford high deductibles, premiums and co-payments charged by private health insurance companies.\nAccording to a 2009 Harvard Medical School study, 45,000 people die unnecessarily each year because they go to a doctor or hospital too late or don't have health insurance at all.\nSanders has proposed expanding the successful health care program for seniors and to build on the advances made under the Affordable Care Act, which Sanders helped craft. Patients would be able to choose their own doctors and receive comprehensive care for everything from hospital stays to emergency room visits to primary and specialty care.\nUnder Sanders' plan, millions of people in the richest nation in the history of the world no longer would have to choose between health care and other necessities like food, heat and shelter.\nSanders also backed a California ballot initiative that could save the state an estimated $4 billion over the next 10 years on prescription drugs.\nToday in the United States, Sanders said, 1 in 5 Americans is unable to afford to fill prescriptions while the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in profits by charging Americans the highest prices anywhere for prescription medicine. \"That's crazy,\" Sanders said\nThe California ballot initiative faces stiff opposition from pharmaceutical which are bankrolling an effort to block the proposition.

Bernie Sanders said neither he nor Hillary Clinton will win enough pledged delegates on June 7 to secure the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\nA total of 694 delegates are at stake in six states with contests next Tuesday. \"No candidate will end up with the number of pledged delegates needed to win the nomination,\" Sanders told 7,800 supporters at an outdoor rally here.\nThe close contest will mean that the selection of a nominee will fall to superdelegates. Those elected officials and other party power brokers won't cast their votes until July at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\nHe aims to persuade superdelegates that it is in their own self-interest and the best interests of their party that Democrats nominate the candidate best able to defeat Donald Trump.\nOne reason Sanders is much more likely than Clinton to win the general election in November is that he leads Donald Trump by margins that often are much greater than Clinton's narrow edge over the likely Republican presidential nominee. In one recent poll in California, for example, he led Trump by 17 points.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n** Please see below for an addendum to the transcript, marked with an asterisk.\n1:27 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see all of you. For those of you who traveled to Asia, welcome back. Before we get started with questions today, I do have a couple remarks I'd like to make at the top about the President's travel to Elkhart, Indiana tomorrow.\nMany of you know that the President is going to return to Elkhart, Indiana tomorrow. Elkhart is, after all, the city that President Obama visited first after assuming the presidency. And during his visit to Elkhart, Indiana back in 2009, President Obama promised that if we worked together we could pull that community and this country out of the depths of recession and put ourselves on a better, stronger course. More than seven years after that visit, and despite near unanimous obstruction from Republicans in Congress, that's exactly what we've done. And I've got a couple of charts here that I think will illustrate that progress.\nWe've cut the unemployment rate in half from a peak of -- nationwide, we've cut the unemployment rate in half from a peak of 10 percent during the recession to just 5 percent today. And Elkhart, as you can see behind me, the unemployment rate quadrupled during the crisis, peaking at 19.6 percent. Today that rate is down to right around 4 percent. At the peak of the housing crisis in 2010, 9.5 percent of mortgages in Elkhart were late or in the process of foreclosure. Today that percentage is down to 3.7, lower than pre-crisis levels. And we've seen similar trends all across the country.\nQ: You mean Indiana, not Elkhart, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that this is a statistic that applies to Elkhart, but we can double-check that for you *[The label on the graphic is correct: 9.5 percent of mortgages in Indiana were late or in the process of foreclosure in 2009].\nAs it relates to the manufacturing sector, this obviously is something that is critically important to the local economy in Elkhart. Manufacturing employment has rebounded and domestic auto production has doubled since the crisis. Elkhart's iconic RV industry is leading that trend and is set to break an all-time production record this year.\nIn the United States and Elkhart, high school graduation rates have risen to their highest level on record. In Elkhart, the graduation rate has reached nearly 90 percent, up from just 75 percent in 2008.\nWhat ties all this together, of course, is the President's work to enact the Recovery Act. And the Recovery Act laid the foundation for many of the trends that we just walked through, with $170 million in critical investments in infrastructure and education in Elkhart alone, alongside additional support for the hardest-hit families through expanded unemployment insurance and Medicaid, as well as tax cuts for the middle class and for working families.\nAll of this contributed to the kind of economic recovery that the private sector has led all across the country, and is a testament to the hard work and tenacity and ambition of business owners and employees and middle-class workers in the Elkhart community. Elkhart is, in fact, a symbol of America's recovery. And that's why, as the American people begin to think more about the very real choice they have in November, the President chose to return to Elkhart to make a forceful case for the policies that have helped communities like Elkhart recover and to talk about how we can build on that success in the months and years ahead.\nSo it should make for a pretty interesting event tomorrow. And hopefully many of you will be able to travel with us as we make the visit.\nSo, with that, Kathleen, we can go to your questions.\nQ: I'll just stick with Elkhart because it seems like this looks like something like a victory lap. But I would suggest the President's polls or approval rating in Elkhart probably don't match some of these stats. So I'm wondering if you have any explanation for why you feel the President isn't getting credit for this kind of economic --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think inherent in our political process are politicians who seek to claim credit for themselves so they can win reelection. President Obama is not running for reelection. And the truth is he implemented these policies in early 2009 because he thought they would help the economy, not because he thought they would have a positive impact on his approval rating. In fact, many of the policies that President Obama implemented were almost unanimously opposed by Republicans. Some of the policies were even opposed by some Democrats.\nFor example, the rescue of the American auto industry is something that has had a profound impact on communities like Elkhart throughout the industrial Midwest. Outside economists have estimated that a million jobs were saved because the American auto industry was rescued. It was on the brink of total collapse, but because of the policy decisions that were implemented by the Obama administration, we now see that the American auto industry is even stronger than before.\nI think that's a testament to the fact that the President was not committed to making decisions based on what impact they would have on his approval rating but rather what impact they would have on the economy. And I think the results speak for themselves.\nI guess to try to answer your question more directly, I think the President does believe, while he is not particularly concerned in accepting credit for himself, he does believe it's important for the American people to understand what sort of policies have made our recovery possible. The President, time and time again, has made clear that it's the private sector who led our recovery; that the determination and commitment of the American people and business owners and workers all across the country to scratch and claw out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, it's the American people who deserve credit for our recovery. But that recovery would not have been possible without the federal government making smart decisions to invest in the middle class, to invest in those aspects of our economy that are critical to our longer-term success.\nThat includes the manufacturing sector. That includes research and development. That includes clean energy. It also includes an investment in middle-class families. And that's why the Recovery Act included more than a dozen tax cuts for small businesses. It included a significant tax cut for middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get into the middle class.\nAnd it's important for the American people to understand exactly what policies created this opportunity, because that's the way to evaluate whether or not the government responded appropriately to the previous economic downturn. And we know that there are going to be challenges that future governments have to confront, and it's important for people to understand exactly what led us out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression so that when future governments have to make a decision that they can draw on relevant evidence about what worked last time.\nQ: So just to be clear, why exactly does the White House think he doesn't get credit?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are probably -- I think there are a variety of explanations for that, and I suspect many of you will write about them in the next 24 hours. (Laughter.) And I think certainly some of it goes back to what I said before about the remarkable and almost unanimous Republican obstruction to many of the solutions that President Obama has proposed.\nAgain, there's a tendency on the part of some outside commentators to essentially want to look for a way to spike the football -- because I think the results are pretty resounding in terms of the wisdom of the approach that President Obama pursued -- but President Obama also understands that there's a lot of important work that still remains to be done. There's still more work that we could do to invest in our infrastructure to ensure the long-term success of our country. There's still more work that we can do to put upward pressure on wages. There's still more work that we can do to reduce inequality.\nAnd we've made important progress on each of those measures, but the President is not content with the progress that we've made thus far. He understands that his successor will have some important decisions to make about whether or not we are going to build on this progress, are we going to build on this momentum, or are we going to tear it down. And there is a pretty clear choice to be made if you take a look at the policies that are being advocated by the two parties.\nQ: And just one more on that. Does the President think there's any chance the Democratic nominee could win Indiana?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I keep going back to this example because it's such a resonant one -- but in late May of 2008, I don't think there was a lot of optimism among Democrats that the Democratic nominee would eventually win that state in the general election, but, of course, that's exactly what then Senator Obama did in 2008. So it certainly is not out of the realm of possibility that Democrats could win it once again.\nBut, look, that will be part of a debate for the individual campaigns to engage in. President Obama will deliver his remarks tomorrow mindful of the political backdrop for his speech, but the focus of his remarks will be on the results of the policies that he implemented early in his presidency.\nQ: And I just wanted to turn to the Inspector General's report on Clinton -- on Secretary Clinton's email. I don't know if you've had a chance to offer some reaction. It was clear that she did not -- even though she said that she -- acknowledged the situation was approved, that she didn't seek approval. She never demonstrated that her BlackBerry met minimum requirements -- security information requirements. Does the President still stand by the statement that he's certain that Clinton did not endanger national security?\nMR. EARNEST: The President does -- the President certainly stands by what he said in the past on this. When the President was given the opportunity to talk about this in Asia, he referred questions to Secretary Clinton's campaign. They can obviously discuss the decisions that she made as Secretary of State as they relate to her use of email. I think the focus of the White House has been on the institutional questions that have been raised about the way in which the State Department manages its records and manages its email system.\nAnd based on the report of the Inspector General, this is a report that was solicited specifically by the current Secretary of State, John Kerry. But according to this report, there were eight specific recommendations that the Inspector General put forward to the Department of State about steps they could take to ensure that proper record maintenance was being implemented. And based on the IG's examination of the situation, all eight of those recommendations have now been resolved in terms of the State Department following through and actually implementing those recommendations that the Inspector General had put forward.\nSo it's clear that the Department of State is fulfilling their institutional responsibilities. That certainly is consistent with the President's commitment to transparency and competence. But for your more specific question about Secretary Clinton's use of email, I'd refer you to her able spokesman.\nQ: And does the White House think that she should have participated -- or cooperated in that IG investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'd refer you to Secretary Clinton's team for how she handled those questions. I think what is clear from the IG is that they took a broad look at what the Department of State needs to do to make sure that they are in compliance with sort of the relevant rules, but also to make sure that they are handling these records in a way that's appropriate and consistent with the commitment that the President has placed on government transparency. And, again, the Inspector General had eight recommendations, all of which have now been implemented by the Department of State.\nTim.\nQ: Turning to North Korea, another missile test. Kind of unusual to do another test of a missile after three failures in April.\nMR. EARNEST: I think there are a number of things that are unusual about North Korea, Tim. But this would certainly be one of them.\nQ: Does the White House have any thinking on why these rollouts keep continuing even though they tend to be duds?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the United States and the rest of the international community calls on North Korea to refrain from actions, including this failed missile test, that further raise tensions in the region, and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments.\nThe United States strongly condemns North Korea's missile test, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which explicitly prohibit North Korea's use of ballistic missile technology. These actions and North Korea's continued pursuit of ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities pose a significant threat to the United States, our allies, and to the stability of the Asia Pacific region.\nI can tell you that U.S. Strategic Command systems detected what we assess was a failed North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile launch yesterday afternoon from North Korea. NORAD conducted their own assessment and determined that the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\nThe President had the opportunity to discuss in Asia steps that the United States has taken in coordination with our allies and our partners in that region of the world to confront North Korea and their ballistic missile program that is in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The President also discussed some of the steps that the United States military has undertaken on his orders to strengthen our defenses in that region of the world, both to protect our allies in Asia, but also to protect the American people back here at home. And we continue to have confidence in the steps that the military has taken to protect the American people and to protect our allies. But we certainly would like to see North Korea begin to take steps that are consistent with the pursuit of compliance with its international obligations.\nQ: What is the White House thinking behind what North Korea is doing here? Even China criticizing --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a renewed assessment to offer in terms of what the leader of North Korea may be contemplating at this point, but what is clear is that the international community does agree that what North Korea is doing is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It's destabilizing and it's something that they should stop doing. And as a result of North Korea's insistence on pursuing this approach, the North Korean government has been increasingly isolated and they're under increasing pressure, economically, as a result of the coordinated actions of the international community.\nWe obviously are hopeful that that pressure will lead to some different strategic decisions being made by the North Korean government. But thus far it has not.\nQ: Turning to Fallujah, the Norwegian Refugee Council -- it's one of the organizations displaced from the city -- has said that a human catastrophe is unfolding there as residents are stuck in the city. To what extent does the White House agree with that assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have my own assessment to offer from here. Obviously the international community has been deeply concerned about the citizens of Fallujah for a couple years now. And that concern is rooted in the willingness of ISIL terrorists to use violence to try to subjugate the local population. And what the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces have undertaken is an effort to try to liberate the city. And they do so mindful of the need to live up to a standard of respecting basic universal human rights. And we do believe that it's important for Iraqi forces, as they undertake these operations and as they seek to liberate the city, that they're mindful of the needs of the local population.\nAfter all, many of the efforts that we've undertaken, both in Iraq and in Syria, have been part of trying to free up some space for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Obviously that's not possible in a city like Fallujah that is controlled by ISIL, but the need for humanitarian assistance once the city is liberated is something that we've been mindful of. And, in fact, President Obama spent some time in meeting with his G7 counterparts last week in Japan in discussing financial assistance that can be provided by the international community to residents of cities in Iraq that have been liberated from ISIL.\nWe understand that these communities have been decimated, their infrastructure has been, in many cases, destroyed, and the civilian population has gone through a terrible ordeal. And the truth of the matter is the economic weakness that we see in Iraq doesn't allow the Iraqi government to deploy as many resources as they would like to try to address that situation and rebuild these communities, and they've benefited significantly from broad international support for those efforts.\nI'd also point out that within the last couple of weeks the IMF has announced a significant package of financial assistance that they'll provide the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government in pursuit of the same kinds of goals. So we're all very mindful of the devastating humanitarian impact of ISIL's violence. That, after all, is the leading motivator for the international community to come together and try to drive them out of these cities and ultimately destroy that organization.\nQ: Fallujah is obviously a huge test for the Iraqi military. To what extent would the administration have preferred to hold off on Fallujah and instead keep concentrating on preparations for Mosul?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said all along, Tim, is that these kinds of operational decisions will be made by the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces. After all, the focus of the President's strategy is to build up the capacity of local forces and local authorities to provide for the security situation in their own country. And that includes taking the fight to ISIL in their own country.\nSo the United States and the rest of the international community is supporting the Iraqi central government and certainly looking for ways to offer our support and assistance to those forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. That's what we're doing in this instance.\nAnd we certainly do believe that this offensive against Fallujah is something that will allow us to make important progress against ISIL, but we also acknowledge that this is something that's going to be a tough fight. This is going to take some time. And it will be a test of the determination and tenacity of Iraqi forces. They've shown that determination and tenacity and resilience on the battlefield in making progress against ISIL in places like Anbar Province and Ramadi. But that will certainly be a challenge to display those qualities in the long fight to retake Fallujah.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, we're about to head into June, which is Pride Month for the LGBT community. The President is said to host a Pride Reception at the White House on June 9th, but how do you anticipate generally the President will observe the occasion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I don't have anything to announce yet about the President's June schedule. But as you point out, the President has in the past hosted receptions like the one that you describe that's set for next week. I think the President obviously is quite proud of the important progress that our country has made over the last seven years when it comes to greater equality for LGBT Americans. And the President is certainly interested in looking for ways to continue to build on that progress.\nQ: The administration is conducting listening sessions on designating a national monument in honor of the 1969 Stonewall riots. There's speculation that it would be announced in time for June of this year. When will the President pull the trigger on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates on any potential presidential designations, but we'll obviously keep you posted on any developments that might be of interest to you. I suspect that might be one of them.\nQ: And a number of cities are hosting Pride celebrations and parades, including D.C., which is hosting its parade on June 11th. Would you rule out the possibility that President Obama this month would participate in an LGBT Pride Parade?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that that's on the President's schedule.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to go back to Indiana first. I know that you outlined some of the positive signs, but I think for a lot of people, Indiana has been kind of symbolic of some of the downsides of the Obama economy. A majority of both Democrats and Republicans in the state, when they went to the polls last month, said that the economy was their top concern. Donald Trump obviously got a lot of traction by pointing out that Carrier was laying off hundreds of people in the state to send those jobs to Mexico as a part of free-trade policies that the President has championed. So I'm wondering how you respond to that and whether the way that the President's economic policies have played out have created a vulnerability that the next Democratic nominee is going to have to grapple with, since you've kind of opened the fact that this a campaign backdrop.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question a couple of ways. The first is, I think that when you take a look at the basic economic measurements in terms of evaluating the impact of the President's policies on Indiana, there's no denying how the people of Indiana have benefited from decisions that President Obama made. And that's true whether you look at the housing market, or look at the manufacturing sector, or you look at the broader unemployment rate.\nBut I think the other way that I would answer your question is to acknowledge that the economic forces of globalization are powerful and they are having an impact on communities all across the country. And the question really for the American people and for voters who go to the polls in November is what do you think is the most effective strategy for dealing with it. And the President has pursued an approach that prioritizes growing our economy from the middle out. And the President believes that if we are focused on what's in the best interest of middle-class families all across the country, we're likely to see the kinds of economic results that are positive.\nSo let's talk about the question of trade, for instance. And I know that this has been the subject of some debate not just in campaigns but in politics now for a number of years. I'm reluctant to get into the decisions made by any individual company, but I think what is true about the decision that was made by Carrier is it's not that different than the decision than we've seen by other manufacturing entities in the United States. And again, those are decisions, some of which actually even predate President Obama's election to the presidency. The point is this: These are longer-running trends, and President Obama has put forward a very specific strategy for dealing with it.\nSo, in some ways, I think the impact on Indiana is a useful illustration. The Carrier plant that you refer to is, according to the announcement made by that company, actually going to be relocated to Mexico. Mexico is a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That is a trade agreement that has not yet been ratified through the United States Congress. And there are Democrats and Republicans who have both said that the movement of this plan is evidence of how damaging free trade is to the U.S. economy.\nSo the question is, are you just going to bemoan that fact, and bemoan the fact that there are manufacturing jobs that are leaving Indiana as a result of this decision by Carrier, or are you actually going to do something about it? And President Obama has pursued a strategy for actually doing something about it -- by completing a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that includes Canada and Mexico, that effectively does renegotiate NAFTA, that will put in place higher and enforceable labor and environmental standards.\nThe President talked quite a bit when he was in Asia about how the agreement also includes higher and enforceable intellectual property standards. These are the kinds of -- and the effect of this, of those standards being included in the agreement, is that it starts to level the playing field. Right now, there is a competitive and unfair advantage that places like Mexico have when it comes to labor conditions in that country. But the Trans-Pacific Partnership, by signing on to it, Mexico is going to be in a position where they have to start meeting higher standards. And that's starting to level the playing field for American businesses and American workers.\nThat doesn't mean it's going to prevent every job from moving overseas. But it does mean that we'll actually be putting some pressure on Mexico and other countries that sign on to the TPP to level that playing field, to give American businesses and American workers here in the United States a better opportunity to compete -- not just as it relates to where to locate their operations, but also in terms of doing business.\nThe United States will now also have better access to customers in Mexico and Canada and other places throughout the Asia Pacific. That's a good thing for the U.S. economy, too. Overall, the Trans-Pacific Partnership would actually cut 18,000 taxes that other countries place on American goods. That's the President's strategy for confronting these powerful forces of economic globalization. And that, I think, is a strategy that is certainly more specific and one that shows more promise than anything that's being articulated by critics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nQ: Senator McCain has proposed an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would boost OCO funding by $19 billion. So this is different from the House version because rather than back-filling it, it would just be an increase, but not have to deal with the sequester caps. You guys have bemoaned using OCO for sort of regular defense spending before. So I'm wondering if you would at all be open to a plan like this. And I'm also wondering if it's still kind of a veto red line for the President that any increase in the defense spending would --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say at the outset that I have not seen Senator McCain's specific proposal. I will note that Senator McCain himself has been previously critical of budget gimmicks that essentially fund regular defense spending through overseas contingency operation budgets. So, presumably, his own proposal is consistent with his own previously expressed views on this. I just haven't seen his specific proposal, so we'll take a look at it.\nIt certainly is the President's expectation that the budget agreement that was signed last year -- and that was a two-year budget agreement -- that Republicans and Democrats in Congress would live up to the commitments that they made in the context of that budget agreement.\nQ: Eric Holder said in a podcast over the weekend that Edward Snowden had performed a public service by leaking documents about the classified NSA's program, while criticizing his methods. I'm wondering if the President agrees with that assessment.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has had the opportunity to speak on this a number of times, and I think a careful review of his public comments would indicate that he does not. Everybody here at the White House who had the opportunity to work with Attorney General Holder certainly respects his work, certainly respects his knowledge and view of the law. And I would point out that even Mr. Holder pointed out in that interview, \"He's broken the law. In my view, he needs to get lawyers, come on back and decide what he wants to do -- go to trial, try to cut a deal. I think there has to be a consequence for what he has done.\"\nWhat Mr. Holder is articulating there is the view of the administration, which is specifically that Mr. Snowden has been charged with serious crimes. He should return to the United States. He should be afforded due process. And that's essentially how the situation should be handled. But Mr. Snowden has not done so.\nQ: Last one. Mitch McConnell, in an interview today, said that he expects an agreement on Zika funding soon. I'm wondering if the White House shares his optimism that an agreement will be coming soon, and if the package that's shaping up on the Hill is something that you guys are okay with, because it will likely be less than the $1.9 billion that you've requested.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that $1.9 billion request was actually one that was put forward by our public health professionals, so that is certainly what we believe that Congress should act on.\nBut congressional action is long overdue. And we have lost an opportunity over the last three or four months here to get ahead of a potentially significant problem. And every day that goes by, even while Congress is on recess, is another day that's lost to preparing to protect the country from the Zika virus. So we certainly would hope that Congress would act quickly to move forward on the funding request that the administration has put forward to ensure we're doing everything that we could possibly do to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nAnd this is a budget request that was put together and is strongly supported by our public health professionals. This is a budget request that Democratic and Republican governors across the country have advocated in favor of. So we need to see some congressional action here. And so hopefully Leader McConnell was right.\nNadia.\nQ: A couple of questions. I want to go back to Fallujah. What does the U.S. think of the Iranian role there? A report that Qassim Suleimani was playing a part in liberating the city. Do you think this plays into ISIS's hands, especially that the Iranians are playing a big part?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the United States has long said is that to allow the situation in Iraq to devolve into a sectarian conflict would only play into the hands of ISIL. And this is not just a view that's been articulated by the United States and a concern that's been articulated by the United States, it's actually a concern that's been articulated by the other members of our counter-ISIL coalition and by Iraq's neighbors, including Iran.\nLook, I'll let the Iranians speak for themselves, but I think it's pretty obvious that it is not in Iran's interest to have this sectarian bloodbath right on their border. They understand that that would only empower ISIL. And the reason that they're involved -- or at least interested in the outcome in Fallujah in the first place is because they don't want to see ISIL strengthened. So they clearly understand -- the Iranians clearly understand the stakes here.\nBut the United States has been clear about what our approach will be. Our approach will be to offer support and assistance to those forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. Our insistence will be that those Iraqi forces operate consistent with basic humanitarian obligations and that they do so respectful of the population that they're seeing to liberate.\nAnd we have made that case, not just because of our commitment to those values and a high standard that we have set when it comes to these kinds of moral questions, but also because of the basic understanding of what ISIL is seeking to do. ISIL is seeking to sow sectarian conflict that will create the kind of chaos that allows them to grow and thrive. So we're certainly mindful of that risk, but I think other countries with an interest in defeating ISIL also recognize that risk.\nQ: So would you say that you would -- any coordination, whether direct or indirect, with the Iranian forces, since both the U.S. and Iran are assisting the Iraqi security forces? And do you have any leverage whatsoever on the Iranians or the Iraqi government to say -- or to illustrate what you just mentioned, that this is not helpful in the long run?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have said here on many occasions that the United States does not plan -- or does not coordinate militarily with Iran. And I'm not aware of any plan to start doing that. What's also true is the Iraqis themselves -- the Iraqi government understands that sectarian division and further sectarian conflict in their country is counterproductive. After all, that's the reason the international community came together to support Prime Minister Abadi, because he promised to change from the kind of sectarian governing agenda that was pursued by his predecessor to pursue a governing agenda that's much more inclusive. And he's faces some obstacles to implementing that agenda, but he's been aggressive in pursuing it.\nAnd that's why the United States has been strongly supportive of Prime Minister Abadi and his efforts. That's why the international community has stepped up in providing the financial assistance, both through the IMF but also through the G7. And the international community is supportive of the Iraqi Prime Minister who's indicated that he understands that further sectarian conflict will not be beneficial to his country and certainly will not be beneficial in the fight against ISIL.\nQ: On Syria, Syrian activists are reporting that Russian airplanes have been hitting a hospital in northern Syria and 50 people dead. Can you, first of all, confirm actually that it was the Russians who hit the hospital? And this is the second incident, I believe, in a short period of time. Do you still believe that the Russian motivation there is really fighting ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that I cannot confirm those reports. Obviously I've seen them and we are following up on those reports. But if it is confirmed, this strike would be the latest in a series of strikes against medical facilities in Syria. The international community needs to get to the bottom of this and those who are responsible for these threats need to be held accountable.\nSo we'll continue to take a look at these reports. As it relates to Russia, we've continued to make clear that Russia needs to be onboard with implementing a Cessation of Hostilities. It means that they have specific obligations as it relates to their own activities, but it also means that it is incumbent upon them to use their influence with the Assad regime to get the Assad regime to abide by the Cessation of Hostilities. And that doesn't just mean in some particular corners of the country. That means in every area that's covered by the Cessation of Hostilities, including communities like Aleppo, Latakia and Idlib.\nOne of the reasons that this Cessation of Hostilities is important and why it's important that this Cessation of Hostilities be implemented is it will allow for humanitarian access. And in some of these communities, including some of the ones that I just discussed, the humanitarian situation is dire and there are basic humanitarian needs like food and water and medical supplies that are going unmet right now. And the international community and the United States is deeply concerned about this. And it's why we believe it important for the Russians to live up to their obligations so that this humanitarian relief can be provided.\nQ: Aren't you a big part of the international community? How are you going to make the Russians accountable?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a number of procedures in place -- I'm not trying to pretend that this is easy, but it certainly has not been for a lack of engagement that our efforts to implement a Cessation of Hostilities across the country has not been as successful as we would like. There have been places where we've seen the frustration -- the Cessation of Hostilities begin to fray, and that's been problematic. And that has put innocent people in harm's way. And the United States remains determined in working with all parties, including the Russians, to remind them of their obligations that they signed onto under the Cessation of Hostilities.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The President-elect of the Philippines said earlier today that corrupt journalists are legitimate targets of assassination. I'm wondering your reaction.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, Olivier, the U.S. government and President Obama believe strongly in basic human rights, including freedom of the press. That is a freedom that's enshrined in our Constitution. But we do not believe that is a uniquely American value -- that's a universal human value. And President Obama has, as he's traveled around the world, strongly made the case, both in private and in public, to world leaders about the need to protect basic press freedoms. And that's been true in places like Cuba and Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, and even in Vietnam, where the President traveled just last week.\nSo this is a priority for the President whenever he travels around the world. And he has not been shy about making a strong case about the importance of protecting professional journalists. And that's the case that he's made both publicly in high-profile settings, but also privately in his direct interactions with world leaders.\nQ: And we've talked a few times about the topic, and I'm sorry if it's getting tedious, but the difference between an American serviceman being in combat versus having a combat mission -- are there objective criteria that lead you to label something a combat mission? Or is that something that is just at the discretion of the President? How does that work?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I mean, Olivier, I think the best that I can do is just to try to provide you with sort of a layman's description of what the President has in mind. I think for sort of a more technical definition you might try the Department of Defense -- maybe there are specific criteria that they have in mind. But what I can do is try to provide you what the President's thinking is as he explains what mission has been given to our men and women in uniform in Iraq and in Syria.\nAnd actually, let me start by referring you to a document that I know that you've closely read -- this is the proposal that the administration put forward for an AUMF more than a year ago. And included in this proposal was some language that I think is relevant to this discussion and it includes this -- I'm quoting now -- \"The authorization I propose would provide the flexibility to conduct ground combat operations in other more limited circumstances, such as rescue operations involving U.S. or coalition personnel, or the use of Special Operations Forces to take military action against ISIL leadership.\nThat is in the AUMF, drawing a distinction between the mission that President Bush gave to our men and women in uniform at the beginning of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the mission that President Obama has given our men and women in uniform who are serving in Iraq right now.\nOur men and women who are serving in Iraq right now are doing so at great danger to themselves. Serving in Iraq, serving in Syria is dangerous, and these are men and women who are putting themselves in harm's way on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief to benefit our national security. And we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude. We also should be candid about what mission they are given and what their responsibilities are and what risks they will assume, and what mission they have not been given.\nAnd that's what the President has tried to describe in a variety of settings, and obviously our military pilots, for example, who are carrying out airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria, that's a dangerous situation. That's also a combat situation. But those are military pilots.\nOn the ground, the goal of our forces on the ground has been to support local forces that are taking the fight to ISIL in their own country. That means it is chiefly the responsibility of Iraqi security forces in Iraq, for example, to seek out and engage ISIL fighters and to drive them out of territory and to occupy it. U.S. forces have been in a situation where they have provided training in advance to those Iraqi forces that are prepared to undertake that kind of mission. They also occasionally will operate in a role that allows them to provide some advice and assistance, even in a dangerous situation, to enhance their ability to operate on the battlefield.\nAnd that has put U.S. forces in a dangerous situation in some circumstances. That's why those forces, when they're deployed to Iraq, have been trained in combat and are armed for combat so that they can defend themselves accordingly. But the President believes that it's important to draw a clear distinction between the dangerous situation that our men and women in uniform face in Iraq and in Syria right now, and the mission that those men and women -- that our men and women in uniform were given in Iraq in 2003 by President Bush.\nQ: I understand that distinction. I think, though, for a lot of people, it's hard when you see American Special Operators rolling in Syria on tanks towards the front lines, that distinction gets really hard. And I saw in the \"Stars and Stripes\" interview that people who were not laymen, like me, also feel a sense of concern about how you are defining this. So I will reach out to the Pentagon, but this is something I want to talk to you more about.\nMR. EARNEST: I mean, as it relates to the technical definition, that's something that my colleagues at the Department of Defense can help you with.\nMichelle.\nQ: On the same subject -- why not stay on that -- now that we are seeing two more U.S. soldiers badly injured -- one in Iraq, one in Syria -- so soon after we saw one soldier killed, I mean, you often say that it's a dangerous mission, but given what the mission is now and kind of how it's evolved, would you say that the mission is now getting more dangerous for U.S. soldiers that are over there?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I would describe it that way. I think that it's been dangerous for U.S. forces in Iraq and in Syria for quite some time. And, look, when the President made the decision in late summer of 2014 to deploy U.S. forces to Iraq, those were forces that were undertaking an operation to ensure the safety and security of U.S. personnel in Iraq and that was dangerous work. The President has also made the decision to allow U.S. forces to train Iraqi forces at some bases outside of Baghdad and Erbil. That work has been dangerous, and the President has been concerned about the safety and security of American personnel that are operating there from the beginning.\nSo we've been mindful of the risk and it's been risky from the beginning. But, again, what we have gone to great lengths to help both the American people understand but also our partners around the world understand -- this is not -- the United States cannot be in a situation where we are imposing a military solution on this problem. This is a fight that the Iraqi people must wage for themselves in Iraq, and this is a fight that the Syrian people must wage for themselves in Syria. And that is the only way that we will find the kind of long-term solution that is in the interest of just about everybody involved.\nQ: But given the situation and how it has changed with ISIS losing ground, and you've said a number of times that ISIS will get more desperate as they start to lose territory and things like that, so as we're talking about offensives coming up and ISIS possibly continuing to lose territory -- won't even an advise-and-assist mission become more dangerous over time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I guess I would leave it to my colleagues at the Department of Defense to offer up that kind of operational assessment. I think the assessment from here is that the work that has been done by our servicemembers in Iraq and in Syria has been dangerous from the beginning, and it's why we owe them a debt of gratitude in terms of the personal sacrifices that they are prepared to make for our national security.\nBut what is also true is that the mission that they are carrying out on the orders of President Obama is a mission designed to bolster the capacity of Iraqi forces to take the fight to ISIL in their own country. And that is different than the mission that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers were given by President Bush to invade Iraq, to seek out the enemy, and to occupy territory. The differences here are significant both in terms of the number of U.S. forces involved but also in the responsibility that's being assumed by those individual forces.\nWhat's probably not different is that for both forces in 2003 and forces operating in Iraq in 2016 it's a dangerous situation, and those forces need to be prepared to defend themselves. And that's why the men and women that President Obama sends into Iraq now are individuals who are armed for combat. These are individuals who have been trained for combat. And, unfortunately, we've seen situations where American servicemembers have been killed in combat because of the situation that they found themselves in.\nQ: It's been said many, many times now, though, by soldiers and former U.S. soldiers that not calling it a combat mission or not -- I don't know -- calling it something other than simply advise and assist diminishes the role that these soldiers are actually doing. How would you respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I would respond to that by saying on countless occasions we have made clear that the distinction that we are drawing is an effort to be as precise and as specific as possible with the American people, with the Iraqi people, and with our partners around the world about what exactly our military personnel are doing in Iraq and in Syria.\nThat does not in any way diminish the sacrifice that they are making for our country. It certainly does not diminish in any way the heroism and courage and professionalism that they have to show on a daily basis, both to protect themselves, to protect their partners and teammates, but also to accomplish the mission. So we are deeply indebted to our men and women in uniform who are making extraordinary sacrifices and taking extraordinary risks to protect our country. They're doing so on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief. And I can tell you that the Commander-in-Chief, as he described just yesterday at Arlington National Cemetery, is deeply respectful of that service and deeply indebted to the commitment that they have shown to their country.\nQ: Okay. And just very quickly on the Eric Holder statements on Edward Snowden. When he was talking about public service, he was referring only to it raising a debate about these programs. Does the White House not agree that that was one maybe good thing that came out of that, or that that is, I don't know, not a service that was done by what he did?\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle, that concern that we have is that the information that revealed by Edward Snowden put the United States and certain U.S. officials in grave danger. It endangered our national security. And that's not just a statement that I have made; that is actually an assessment that has been reached by leaders in our intelligence community.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, there is a path for whistleblowers to take if they have legitimate concerns about what they are seeing, particularly when it comes to handling classified, sensitive information. And Mr. Snowden has been charged with serious crimes because he did not do that. And it's our view that he should return to the United States, be offered due process, but that he should face those charges directly, in person, on American soil.\nI'll just say more broadly, Michelle, that what's also true is President Obama came into office vowing to pursue reforms of many of these programs and much of the work to reform these programs was being discussed and, in some cases, was even initiated before anybody had ever heard of Edward Snowden.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, as you know, the French are convening a conference later this week to try to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. There's reports that Secretary Kerry is planning to attend this. Nevertheless, the Israelis have been opposed to this conference from the start, arguing that the way to find a solution to this is through bilateral talks between the two sides and not this kind of multiparty arrangement. Does the White House support what the French are doing, or does the White House have some understanding of the reservations the Israelis have?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it has been the U.S. principle for quite some time -- not just under President Obama, but under previous Presidents -- that a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only be generated by talks between the two parties. Ultimately, it's the two parties that will have to make the difficult decisions and, in some cases, sacrifices that will be required to make peace.\nHowever, the rest of the international community, including the United States, has long played an important role in trying to bring both sides to the table. And the United States has used our influence in the international community to try to facilitate conversations and try to facilitate talks, and try to help the two sides identify potential common ground. Secretary Kerry has certainly invested a lot in that effort early in President Obama's second term.\nSo there has long been a role for the international community to try to encourage both sides to pursue reconciliation and to try to bring an end to the conflict that hasn't just led to a lot of innocent lives in that particular region of the world, but has also fueled conflicts in the region for more than a generation now.\nBut, look, as it relates to Secretary Kerry's travel and what his expectations are for the meeting, I'd refer you to the State Department.\nQ: But you are saying you support the idea behind the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Support the --\nQ: You're endorsing the idea of holding this conference?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think that I would do that. I'd refer you to the State Department to see what their specific view would be. I think what I'm merely observing is that the Israelis and Palestinians will resolve their differences when they sit down face-to-face and actually engage in constructive conversations about resolving their differences. And there is a role for the international community to play in terms of encouraging both sides to contribute constructively to that process. But nobody in the international community, including the United States, can make those difficult decisions for the parties. Ultimately, the parties themselves have to make those decisions.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I have some questions on three different subjects. Going back to Chris and Pride in June, President Obama was basically called the \"rights President,\" advocating a voice -- you know, the talks on equality for everyone. Being President, he worked through his issues that he had. As an outgoing President, as someone who's considered a \"rights President,\" primarily starting from the issue of gay rights, what's the legacy of this President when it comes to the LGBT community?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I'll just say as a general matter that the President is enormously proud of the progress that our country has made over the last seven or eight years of becoming a more accepting society for LGBT Americans. The President has long been a champion of equality and justice, and certainly we have seen that equality for LGBT Americans grow in the last seven or eight years.\nWhat the President's legacy is, though, is something that historians will have to determine. And the President has still got another seven or eight months here in office that he's very focused on the task that he has at hand. So for questions about legacy, it will be answered by historians many years from now, who will take a look at the progress that our country has made. They'll take a look at the leadership that President Obama displayed, and draw their own conclusions about what the President's legacy says about the country.\nQ: So do you believe that his evolution on this issue has opened minds and opened hearts to be more embracing of different people?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think leaders in the LGBT community would say that President Obama's evolution on gay marriage and President's Obama's commitment to fighting for greater equality for LGBT Americans has been important to that fight, has been important to that struggle. But again, when it comes to sort of evaluating the full sweep of his legacy, that's something that historians will be able to better assess many years from now.\nQ: On Cleveland, we understand that the federal government has offered millions of dollars in prevention and also dealing with if there is a possible -- if there's violence there. What is the Obama administration offering, and where are you offering, and will you help in any kind of way as it relates to possible violence in Cleveland for the RNC Convention?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the United States Secret Service has, at least for the last several conventions, played the lead role in ensuring the safety and security of everybody who attends those conventions. And there are significant federal resources that have been expended in that effort. Obviously, federal law enforcement officials, including at the Secret Service, are working closely with state and local law enforcement officials to ensure that security and to ensure that it's not just the nominee and the running mate that are protected, but everybody else who is participating in the convention can attend and express his or her political views freely and without being subject to violence.\nSo that certainly was true what federal officials worked closely with the cities of Charlotte and Tampa in 2012, and it certainly is true both as it relates to the Secret Service's role in Philadelphia and Cleveland this year.\nQ: Do you think that the atmosphere is charging up even more? I mean, I'm thinking back to when this President first ran for the office and people were aghast when they were hearing people were carrying guns to rallies. And now you have a situation where at one point people were thinking about carrying guns to the RNC Convention, and that was kiboshed. And now there's a possibility of violence. What is this climate? Where are we right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the role of the Secret Service is to ensure that those who participate in the conventions can do so safely. But I'll leave commentary and the political views of those who choose to attend the RNC to someone else.\nQ: Has the President said anything to you? Because he's an avid follower of social media. Has he talked about it at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is certainly aware of the robust political debate that's playing out on the campaign trail and likely to be on display at the conventions. But look, ultimately those who attend the Republican Convention should have an opportunity to do so safely.\nQ: And the last question. Climate change -- did they talk anything about climate change in this hurricane preparedness conversation today?\nMR. EARNEST: There certainly was a discussion about how some of the very early effects of climate change put some communities across the country at even greater risk from a hurricane. So one example is that there are some communities in South Florida where we have seen sea levels rise and begin to encroach on populated land. That makes a potential impact of storm surge associated with a significant hurricane even more dangerous. And the President is certainly mindful of that risk here at the beginning of hurricane season.\nFortunately, he and the country are very well-served by having somebody like Craig Fugate as the head of FEMA. Mr. Fugate is somebody who is a legitimate expert when it comes to helping communities prepare for and respond to a hurricane. And he has restored tremendous competence to that government agency, and the President is certainly proud to have had somebody like Mr. Fugate serving the country in that role while he's been President.\nKaren.\nQ: Hi, Josh. You said earlier that the President would be mindful of the political backdrop of the speech tomorrow in Elkhart. Will he wade into the Democratic race?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I do not anticipate that the President is going to name any candidates tomorrow. But I would anticipate that the President will use this opportunity to draw a clear illustration about the choice that the American people will face in November, and that choice is on full display in Elkhart. Elkhart is a community that has benefitted tremendously from many of the decisions that President Obama made early in his presidency to support that community's recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\nAnd the President will lay out what's at stake if Republicans, at every level, have their way. We've seen Republicans in Congress fighting tooth and nail to roll back our progress. In fact, they fought the implementation of some of these solutions in the first place. And the question really is a choice between those on the right, who are telling a story of a smaller America that's defined and held back by our differences, and the kind of optimistic vision that President Obama has repeatedly laid out about how our country's diversity makes us stronger and how we can build on the progress that we've made over the last seven years that will ensure everybody has a chance at success.\nLook, the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who recently has taken to the trail to hock a book, even he has acknowledged that the American people are better off than we were seven years ago. Even he understands that we've made important progress. Apparently he doesn't appreciate the irony of the fact that much of that progress came in spite of his efforts to limit President Obama's success, limit the country's success, and to make President Obama a one-term President. That was his stated strategy.\nAnd that's really the argument that the President will lay out tomorrow. And when you consider how Elkhart was affected by the economic downturn, and when you consider that Elkhart was the first community that President Obama visited as President of the United States, it serves as a rather apt illustration of the argument that I think we're prepared to have here over the next few months.\nQ: On a different topic, yesterday there was another lockdown at the White House, an object thrown over the fence. And over the weekend we read about the Secret Service's proposal for building a higher fence -- 14 feet, double what it currently is, with thicker spikes. Has the President seen the renderings of that potential fence? And if he has, what does he think about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has seen any of the individual renderings that have been made public just in the last few days. You'll recall that more than a year ago, after a significant security incident here at the White House, that there was a review that was conducted by the Secret Service where a variety of reforms were developed for enhancing security here at the White House while also protecting the status of the White House as a functioning government building among the more popular tourist destinations in the country.\nSo the United States Secret Service has a very complex mission here on these 18 acres, and the President has full confidence in the professionalism and the capacity of the United States Secret Service to implement the reforms that our professionals believe are necessary to protect not just the President and the First Family here at the White House, but to protect everybody who works or tours the White House every day.\nBill.\nQ: Republicans on the Hill today are saying that there is no funding crisis for Zika, there never has been, and they are accusing the White House of politicizing a public health emergency.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think by definition, a public health emergency -- at least what our public health professionals tell us -- is something that requires additional funding so that we can protect the American people. So what this administration has done is aggressively advocated for the resources that our public health professionals say that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people. And when it comes to protecting pregnant women and their babies, the President believes that we should go to great lengths to do that. If Republicans disagree --\nQ: They're saying the money is there.\nMR. EARNEST: If Republicans think that it's not that important for us to go to great lengths to protect pregnant women and their babies, then they're certainly entitled to make that case. I think that's going to be a tough case for them to make, but they're certainly entitled to make it.\nQ: I didn't hear them make that case exactly, but they seem to suggest that the money is there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our public health professionals disagree with them. Democratic and Republican governors across the country disagree with them. And President Obama made the case back in February that Congress should act quickly to appropriate the necessary funds. And Republicans now, for more than three months, have dragged their feet and, yes, enhanced the risk facing the American people from the Zika virus because our public health professionals have not gotten the benefit of having had the last three months to prepare for a mosquito population that could be carrying a dangerous virus.\nNow, what we've said from the beginning is that this virus is not dangerous to most people, but it does pose a particular danger to pregnant women and their babies. And that is something that we believe is worth protecting. And what our public health professionals say is that we need $1.9 billion in specifically allocated resources to do everything possible to fight that virus.\nThat's what we've been seeking for more than three months now to implement. And governors across the country share our concern about this. I know that public health professionals across the country share our concern about this. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress appear to not have gotten the message.\nQ: Can you confirm that the Obamas have agreed to rent a home after they leave the White House that is in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've obviously read those reports. I'm not in a position to confirm any details about the housing arrangements that President Obama and his family have made for February of 2017. You've heard the President say before that he and the First Lady intend to remain in Washington for at least a couple of years at the conclusion of his presidency so as not to disrupt the education of their youngest daughter. But I don't have any details on where exactly that will be at this point.\nQ: In other words, if you did, you wouldn't tell us.\nMR. EARNEST: That's probably true. But at this point, I don't.\nKevin.\nQ: On the fence situation, which seems to be ongoing, why not just move pedestrian traffic across Pennsylvania Avenue? They still get clear view. It would seem to make things safer. Is that something the Secret Service is considering?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you should check with the Secret Service about this. Obviously, there are professionals there that are assessing the situation. And what they're trying to balance, Kevin, is the pride that I think all citizens take in having the seat of democracy here in Washington, D.C. -- the White House, the home of the President -- also be something that's accessible to the public. And there are -- I think it's even hundreds of thousands of Americans who visit the White House every year as tourists. There are also hundreds of people who work here in the White House every day as either journalists or employees of the federal government.\nSo our security professionals have a daunting task both to protect a valuable piece of real estate and the occupants of that building, but they also need to ensure that people who are touring the place or people who work here have access to it. And striking that balance is not easy, but it certainly is something that we believe the professionals at the Secret Service have the capacity to do.\nQ: Let me ask you, on Zika, should we expect another briefing from the public health officials that have been here previously?\nMR. EARNEST: If you'd like one, I'm sure we could arrange it. But look, what is clear is that this is a serious situation. And our public health professionals are taking it seriously, and they're doing as much as they can, with the limited resources that they have right now. But there is more that they believe that they can and should be doing to ensure that the American people are protected, particularly pregnant women and their babies that are most at risk -- that are most threatened by this specific virus. And they're not able to do that right now for only one reason, and that's because Republicans in Congress have blocked the effort to provide them those necessary resources.\nQ: So I'm trying to square, though, if there's a great risk here -- potential great risk here, does the White House believe that Americans should not go to the Olympics in Brazil?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think our public health professionals have spoken to this, so I'd defer to the advice of Dr. Frieden and others. I think what they have said, at least in part, is that pregnant women shouldn't go. Pregnant women shouldn't travel to those areas that are experiencing a widespread outbreak of the Zika virus. But for detailed advice, I would encourage people to consult a source that's more authoritative on medical issues than the White House Press Secretary.\nQ: Okay. A quick follow also on the IG situation involving former Secretary Clinton. Was it an oversight that the President didn't nominate a permanent IG during her time as Secretary of State? And was that a mistake?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there were a number of people who were considered for that position. I don't have a lot of details about that personnel process. What I do know is that even while an active interim IG was serving at the State Department, there were dozens of reports and other findings that were published, even when there wasn't one inspector general leading the department. So I think that's an indication that the individuals in that office took quite seriously the responsibilities that they had to provide oversight and to conduct independent investigations to ensure that the people's business was being conducted appropriately at the State Department. But as it relates to that personnel decision, I just don't have much information about it.\nQ: So it wasn't a mistake, you don't think, to not nominate a permanent IG?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think anybody would be hard-pressed to make the case that somehow the Office of the Inspector General wasn't functioning effectively -- because I think if you take a look at the dozens of reports that were generated during Secretary Clinton's tenure at the State Department, it's clear that there was aggressive oversight in place.\nQ: Okay. A couple more. Is there anything the U.S. can do or is doing to prevent China from further militarizing the contested waters in the South China Sea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the case that we have made is that the United States does not make any claims to the land features in that region of the world. The United States doesn't even back one specific country's claim. We simply believe that all the countries that do have competing claims should resolve those disputes through diplomacy, and based on international rules and international law and regular order.\nAnd what the United States is seeking to preserve is the ability of every country in the world and of legitimate commercial interests to traverse the South China Sea to ensure that commerce is not disrupted. And certainly China has a significant stake in ensuring that that commerce can continue unimpeded. And we certainly would not want disputes over some of these land features to devolve into a military conflict of one form or another. We believe that those countries with competing claims should pursue, through already-established international procedures, a resolution to those disputes.\nQ: You mentioned something earlier about combat, and I just wanted to kind of drill down on something. And I know I could go to DOD about the specific yes or no, but I'm just curious about your opinion or about the White House's perspective. If a colonel is serving with his company, and he's in a very dangerous advise-and-assist environment, combat environment, but isn't actually out there on patrol, does that person deserve credit for having served in combat, even if they're not out there on patrol?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I will say is this: I will defer to my military colleagues at the Department of Defense who obviously have to make decisions about military citations and other recognition that is afforded to our men and women in uniform who serve this country.\nQ: But you see what I'm getting at?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, here's what I -- let me finish my answer, because I think this goes to what you're getting at. All Americans owe a deep debt of gratitude to our servicemembers who are in that situation because I think what is clear, and certainly what the Commander-in-Chief understands, is that those are individuals who are taking an extraordinary personal risk, that are entering a dangerous situation on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief because it enhances our national security and keeps the rest of us safe.\nSo as it relates to the military designations that they're given, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. But as it relates to the debt of gratitude that all Americans owe those servicemembers, I think you can put the White House down in the column of a group of people who believe that the American people are indebted to those servicemembers for their service to the country.\nQ: And last one. CEOs of some of the companies at the center of the recovery in Indiana cite a can-do attitude and a business-friendly environment, including the right to work, that's allowed Indiana to succeed in spite of, they say, the President's policies. Do you deny that low interest rates and low gas prices also played a part in the recovery that Indiana has enjoyed since 2009?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has been clear, both from the early days of the recession to now, that it's the private sector that led our recovery. And it is through the grit and determination of America's workers and small business owners that we have not just survived but actually thrived in the aftermath of the Great Recession. And there are a number of things that contributed to that success. Many of them are policies that President Obama initiated that were strongly opposed by Republicans. And that is an inconvenient fact for a number of Republicans who are running for Congress and advocating a much different agenda than the one that President Obama has been fighting for, for the last seven years.\nPresident Obama believes that by focusing on the middle class and trying to grow our economy from the middle out, that is what has laid the foundation for our longer-term economic strength, and that's the progress that President Obama believes that we should build on moving forward.\nCarol.\nQ: I just wanted to quickly clarify on the Eric Holder/Edward Snowden question. You're not saying that the President -- setting aside Edward Snowden -- you're not saying that the President doesn't think that having a national debate about surveillance is worthwhile, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's setting aside a lot. But setting aside Edward Snowden, should we have a debate in this country about government transparency and about steps that we can take to protect the American people while also being accountable to the American people? The President does believe that that's a worthy debate. The President does not believe that we should reveal government secrets that endanger Americans and endanger our national security to have it.\nIn fact, President Obama initiated many of these reforms and certainly engaged in discussions about some of these reforms before anybody had even heard of Edward Snowden. And I think that's a testament to the President's commitment to government transparency and protecting the privacy of the American people. But the President does not believe that we need to reveal secrets that endanger our national security in order to have that debate.\nPam, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Okay. Just two quick ones. As far as the Elkhart trip, is it fair to call it a campaign trip, just based on how you described what the President will be talking about? And has he come around to Vice President Biden's thinking yet, that Hillary Clinton will be the nominee and win the election?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has not reached any conclusions about the conclusion of the Democratic nominating process. Obviously there are still votes to be cast in a couple of states and even in the District of Columbia, I believe. So I do not anticipate at this point that he is going to signal a preference or going to indicate the end of a race until it's ended.\nAs it relates to how you describe the trip -- look, based on some of the questions that the President got at his media availability in Japan, I think there would be some reporters who would describe his Japan trip as a campaign trip. (Laughter.) But the President's focus when he travels to Elkhart tomorrow will be on our economy, and I think the President would welcome a debate in the context of the campaign but also outside the context of the campaign about what are the economic policies that best serve the country. And the President believes that policies that expand economic opportunity for the middle class, policies that are focused on growing our economy from the middle out -- those are the kinds of policies that best serve the American people not just in the short term, but over the long term.\nAnd the President certainly believes that's the strategy that was effectively pursued over the seven years of his presidency so far, and he certainly believes that the next President and the next Congress and the next slate of governors and state legislators that are elected across the country in November should look for ways to build on that progress because he believes the country will be best served by doing that.\nQ: And on the Japan trip, the President made the historic visit to Hiroshima. Some might even call it a magnanimous gesture. It wasn't an apology, but it was certainly an acknowledgment of the suffering that occurred there when the bomb was dropped. Did the President feel dissed at all or surprised that Prime Minister Abe, as soon as he arrived in Japan, kind of scolded him publicly over the crime that occurred in Okinawa?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think these are two different issues. Obviously, the President expressed his profound sorrow on behalf of the American people to the victim of that terrible crime. President Obama reiterated that the United States would, within the confines of the law, coordinate on the investigation and ensure that justice was served in this particular incident. But I don't think that in any way overshadowed what I agree was an historic visit to Hiroshima that occurred a couple days later.\nQ: And is he going to take any steps, as the Prime Minister suggested, to try to control crime that might be associated with the U.S. military there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the Prime Minister was alluding to are steps that could be taken by U.S. personnel in Okinawa that could have an impact on the way that U.S. military facilities there are run -- the way that people have access to the facilities and the way that personnel spend time off the base. So I'd refer you to local military officials in Okinawa for details about that.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:48 P.M.

Hello. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. And I guess it is the blue-and-white house today—[laughter]—because we're giving it up for the 2016 NCAA Champion Villanova Wildcats!\nNow, you should know that we have some big 'Nova fans here, from both sides of the aisle in Congress. We also want to acknowledge Villanova president, Reverend Peter Donohue, who is here. Athletic Director Mark Jackson, who capped off his first year as athletic director with a national championship—pretty good job. [Applause] Pretty good.\nUnfortunately, perhaps the most important 'Nova grad here, Dr. Jill Biden, could not be here. I think she may be teaching, but her husband Joe wanted me to remind you that he picked 'Nova to win it all. [Laughter] This is the type of wise counsel that you are looking for from a Vice President. [Laughter] Unfortunately, I didn't follow his counsel, and so my bracket was busted. [Laughter]\nWe have the best dressed man in college basketball—the George Clooney of coaches—[laughter]—Jay Wright. And today we celebrate a remarkable team that worked tirelessly to make Coach look good in terms of his job and not just his wardrobe. [Laughter] His tailor and stylist could not make it, but we do have his basketball players here. [Laughter]\nSo Coach Wright and this team treated us to as memorable a run and as memorable a championship game as I can remember. We'll talk more about that game in a second, but these Wildcats were about more than just one moment or one shot. They had unbelievable defense. They had great clutch shooting. A senior class that won more games than any group in Wildcats history. They had a stable of talented players who were as happy hitting the deck for a loose ball as they were cutting down the nets.\nYou had Daniel Ochefu, a.k.a. \"the Chef\"—[laughter]—who became just the seventh player in program history to score 1,000 points and grab 900 boards—pretty good. Also not afraid to do the little things, we saw him grab that mop right in the middle of the game. [Laughter]\nWe had Josh Hart who led the Wildcats in scoring. Congratulations, Josh. Josh, where'd you go to school?\nGuard Josh Hart. Sidwell Friends.\nThe President. Sidwell Friends School. Well, my daughter will be graduating from there next week, which makes me cry when I talk about it, so I'm not going to talk about it. [Laughter] But it was good to see a Sidwell kid do well.\nKris Jenkins—a.k.a. \"Big Smoove\"—[laughter]—had—[applause]. He learned how to shoot from his mom. Moms know what they're talking about. And then, there is Ryan Arcidiacono. Now, I just sped through that in case I didn't say it right. [Laughter] \"Barack Obama\" is tough, but \"Arcidiacono\"—man, that's a lot of vowels in there, so we're just going to call him Arch. [Laughter] A captain since his freshman year, wore the blue and white in more games than any Wildcat ever, and went out in style as the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. So we are very, very proud of him. Give him a big round of applause.\nBut more than any individual honor, this team possessed something that the coaches preached from day one, and that's attitude. As Coach Wright says, \"In life, you cannot control what happens to you, but you do control how you respond to it.\"\nAnd that's how they bounced back from disappointing tournaments these past few years. That's how they rolled through the first three rounds by an average of 24 points, beat Kansas to punch their ticket to the Final Four. In Houston, they blew the doors off Oklahoma by a Final Four record 44-point margin.\nAll of which set up an unbelievable showdown with the Tar Heels—it might be maybe the best title game of all time. Just the last few seconds could be a documentary—you had an unbelievable double-clutch circus shot from Marcus Paige on UNC's team. A lot of teams would have had their spirit broken. Wildcats, they took control, they responded. And on a play called Nova, Kris took a pass from Arch and pulled up a few steps behind the line and shot this team into basketball lore. That was a good shot. [Laughter] You know, it was like a Christian Laettner shot. It was like a Jimmy-V.-running-up-and-down-the-court shot. Charles Barkley apparently jumped out of his seat, which—[laughter]—he doesn't do very often these days. [Laughter]\nCoach—legendary Coach Massimino, who led their Wildcats to their first title 31 years ago, obviously couldn't be prouder. Coach Wright, on the other hand, played it cool—[laughter]—just turned around, shook hands like nothing happened. [Laughter] But I know inside, he was pretty excited. [Laughter]\nSo this is a team for the ages, on and off the court. Their grades ranked in the top 10 percent nationally. [Applause] That's worth applauding. All five seniors graduated. In fact, ever since nineteen—the 1970s, the Wildcats have graduated every 4-year player. And that's the kind of record that you really want.\nThey're also involved in the Philadelphia community, serving meals for those in need, supporting the Special Olympics. A few days after their win, Arch and the Chef heard about a fan—a small boy battling cancer—who could use a boost. So without fanfare, they snuck into the boy's basement and hid in his playhouse to surprise him, which seems a little scary. [Laughter] But their hearts were in the right place.\nAnd that's what we saw all year from this team: the heart of a champion. So congratulations to the Wildcats for an unbelievable season.\nAnd with that, let me give the podium very quickly to ]— Coach Wright.\nHead Coach Jay Wright. Mr. President, after the championship, we had a big press conference, but nothing as big as this. This is——\nThe President. There's a lot of cameras around here.\nCoach Wright. This is big-time. And on behalf of our entire 'Nova family, I want to thank you and your staff for inviting us to the White House. This is a great day for Villanova University, and you invited all the politicians and everybody connected to Villanova. We love having them here. Thank you for doing that. And your staff has been incredible to us.\nYou're a great leader, and we want two of our leaders, Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel Ochefu, to share with you the jersey—44th President of the United States—that we wore this year at Pearl Harbor. And it was on Pearl Harbor Day, and we really want to thank you. And it says on there, \"For your great leadership, your service to our country, you're truly a great role model for our young men.\" We want them to be great leaders like you. And we thank you for everything you do for our country, and we welcome you to the 'Nova nation with your Villanova jersey.\nThe President.

It accompanies us in our daily lives, and it has rung out at turning points in our history and demonstrated how our achievements as a culture go hand-in-hand with our progress as a Nation. During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we honor the artists who, through this music, bring us together, show us a true reflection of ourselves, and inspire us to reach for the harmony that lies beyond our toughest struggles.\nSongs by African-American musicians span the breadth of the human experience and resonate in every corner of our Nation—animating our bodies, stimulating our imaginations, and nourishing our souls. In the ways they transform real stories about real people into art, these artists speak to universal human emotion and the restlessness that stirs within us all. African-American music helps us imagine a better world, and it offers hope that we will get there together.\nThis month, we celebrate the music that reminds us that our growth as a Nation and as people is reflected in our capacity to create great works of art. Let us recognize the performers behind this incredible music, which has compelled us to stand up—to dance, to express our faith through song, to march against injustice, and to defend our country's enduring promise of freedom and opportunity for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as African-American Music Appreciation Month.

People have lived off of these lands and waters throughout history, and today, they continue to enrich our national experience. In June, we celebrate America's natural and cultural treasures and rich bounty of resources, and we recommit to upholding our responsibility, as those who came before us did, to ensure they are sustained for those who will inherit them.\nFrom dense forests and vast deserts to lakes and rivers teeming with wildlife, our National Parks and other public spaces belong to all of us. That is why I have sought to protect places that are culturally and historically significant and that reflect the story of all our people. My Administration has also worked hard to ensure that everyone has the chance to easily visit and enjoy these spectacular areas. All Americans can explore the parks and monuments we share as our birthright, including through the \"Find Your Park\" campaign, which my Administration established to help connect people from all walks of life with new outdoor destinations and experiences. We also established the \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative, offering free access to our National Parks and other public lands and waters for an entire year to fourth grade students and their families. And by increasing funding for the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps, we are striving to give more Americans hands-on opportunities to restore, enhance, and give back to the outdoor spaces that have given us so much.\nOur experiences in nature remind us how fragile our ecosystems can be and of our obligation to protect them. That is why I am proud to have set aside more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters—more than any President in our history—and why my Administration has taken unprecedented action to tackle climate change. The planet and its natural beauty are changing as rising temperatures fuel the melting of glaciers and the increasing intensity of extreme weather events, including longer wildfire seasons and deeper droughts, and as seas rise, coastal communities face greater threats from flooding and eroding shorelines. It is within our power to address the peril of climate change, and we must act before it is too late.\nDuring Great Outdoors Month, let us enjoy our Nation's natural bounty, whether in reflective solitude or in the energizing company of friends and family. As we rediscover the beauty of the outdoors—in our own backyards, along distant trails, or in the shadows of towering mountains—let us rededicate ourselves to preserving nature's splendor for future generations.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as Great Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors and to uphold our Nation's legacy of conserving our lands and waters. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-31", "title": "Proclamation 9456—Great Outdoors Month, 2016"}

This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth. The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society. They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment—under our laws, from our courts, and in our politics. This month, we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation toward justice.\nLast year's landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines. For every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every American who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope, affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals.\nLGBT individuals deserve to know their country stands beside them. That is why my Administration is striving to better understand the needs of LGBT adults and to provide affordable, welcoming, and supportive housing to aging LGBT Americans. It is also why we oppose subjecting minors to the harmful practice of conversion therapy, and why we are continuing to promote equality and foster safe and supportive learning environments for all students. We remain committed to addressing health disparities in the LGBT community—gay and bisexual men and transgender women of color are at a particularly high risk for HIV, and we have worked to strengthen our National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce new infections, increase access to care, and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV.\nDespite the extraordinary progress of the past few years, LGBT Americans still face discrimination simply for being who they are. I signed an Executive Order in 2014 that prohibits discrimination against Federal employees and contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. I urge the Congress to enact legislation that builds upon the progress we have made, because no one should live in fear of losing their job simply because of who they are or who they love. And our commitment to combatting discrimination against the LGBT community does not stop at our borders: Advancing the fair treatment of all people has long been a cornerstone of American diplomacy, and we have made defending and promoting the human rights of LGBT individuals a priority in our engagement across the globe. In line with America's commitment to the notion that all people should be treated fairly and with respect, champions of this cause at home and abroad are upholding the simple truth that LGBT rights are human rights. There remains much work to do to extend the promise of our country to every American, but because of the acts of courage of the millions who came out and spoke out to demand justice and of those who quietly toiled and pushed for progress, our Nation has made great strides in recognizing what these brave individuals long knew to be true in their hearts—that love is love and that no person should be judged by anything but the content of their character. During Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, as Americans wave their flags of pride high and march boldly forward in parades and demonstrations, let us celebrate how far we have come and reaffirm our steadfast belief in the equal dignity of all Americans.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate the great diversity of the American people.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-31", "title": "Proclamation 9457—Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2016"}

Millions of people in the United States are connected to our Caribbean neighbors through ties of commerce and family—a relationship reinforced by the values and history we hold in common. During National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we celebrate the contributions of our Caribbean-American brothers and sisters, and we reflect on how they have bolstered our country and enriched our traditions.\nThe bonds between the United States and the Caribbean remain strong. Both rooted in similar legacies—of trial and triumph, oppression and liberation—our narratives have advanced on a similar path of progress, driven forward by our shared dedication to fostering opportunity and forging a brighter future. Caribbean Americans excel in our universities, inspire us as athletes and musicians, guide us as community and government leaders, and keep us safe through dedicated service in our Armed Forces.\nThe United States is committed to working with the nations of the Caribbean to advance security, liberty, and prosperity. That is why we have begun a new chapter in our relationship with Cuba—extending a new hand of friendship to the Cuban people that offers fresh hope for both our futures and will improve the lives of those living in both our countries. My Administration also introduced the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to provide higher education exchanges to students across the Western Hemisphere, and we launched the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps in the Americas and to give emerging entrepreneurs and civil society leaders the resources they need to reach their full potential. In harnessing the spirit and boldness of young people in the Caribbean and throughout the Americas, and in channeling their creativity and innovation, we can continue to build on the progress we have made. And by carrying out Jamaican-American poet Claude McKay's call to \"strive on to gain the height although it may not be in sight,\" we can enable more young people, here at home and throughout the Caribbean, to reach for the change that is within their grasp.\nThe legacy of Caribbean Americans is one of tenacity and drive; it reminds us that in America, with faith and determination, anything is possible. This month, let us honor the resilient heritage and rich history of Caribbean Americans, and let us reflect upon the diversity of experiences that unites us as a people.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to celebrate the history and culture of Caribbean Americans with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-31", "title": "Proclamation 9458—National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2016"}

Home to a great diversity of plant and animal species, their precious ecosystems provide food and energy that are integral to our survival. In bringing tourism and recreation to coastal areas, oceans are important to America's economy, and they help facilitate trade and transportation, give mobility to our Armed Forces, and preserve our Nation's maritime heritage. In observation of National Oceans Month, we recommit to good ocean stewardship and redouble our efforts to preserve the health and resilience of our vast oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.\nJeopardizing marine populations and degrading oceanic habitats, pollution poses a significant risk to all of our interconnected oceans. Oceans and their nearby regions are also highly vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate—a once-distant threat that is now very present and is affecting ecosystems and shoreline communities on every coast. Rising sea levels, coastal storms, and a growing risk of erosion and flooding are looming realities faced by seaside towns. It is critical that we take measures to safeguard our blue planet and heed the urgency to defend against these mounting threats, particularly in the Arctic where the effects of a changing climate are already swiftly accelerating.\nIn collaboration with stakeholders; scientists; businesses; and State, tribal, and local partners, my Administration is continuing to implement the National Ocean Policy, a coordinated effort to support local communities, strengthen our ocean economy, and improve the health of our oceans. We are concentrating on key areas outlined in our 2016 Annual Work Plan, including combatting illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing and monitoring significant changes in the acidity of our oceans. We are also focused on reducing the toxic effects of harmful algal blooms, which occur when algae grow too rapidly and threaten the safety of our food, drinking water, and air quality. Using the science-based roadmap laid out in the National Ocean Policy, we are dedicated to enhancing the economic and ecological sustainability of our oceans and advancing our knowledge of how they influence and are influenced by human activity.\nThis month, let us continue the work of ensuring the well-being of these grand bodies of water and the communities that depend on them. As we celebrate the immense beauty and power of our oceans, we are reminded of our shared responsibility to protect them—now and for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as National Oceans Month. I call upon Americans to take action to protect, conserve, and restore our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-05-31", "title": "Proclamation 9459—National Oceans Month, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:50 a.m. in the M1 Conference Room. In his remarks, he referred to Richard Knabb, Director, National Hurricane Center.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117696", "text": "Well, my important responsibility as President of the United States is to keep our people safe. And that's why I just met with key members of my Homeland Security team, including our FEMA director, Craig Fugate, here at FEMA's National Response Coordination Center. And Craig and his team gave us updates on preparations for the 2016 hurricane season, which starts tomorrow.\nAll of us have seen the heartbreak, the damage, and in some cases, the loss of life that hurricanes can cause. And as climate continues to change, hurricanes are only going to become more powerful and more devastating. Now, States play the primary role in preparing for and responding to disasters. But our team here works around the clock to make sure that those States and the people living in those States have everything that they need to get the job done.\nOne of the things that we have learned over the course of the last 7½ years is that government plays a vital role, but it is every citizen's responsibility to be prepared for a disaster. And that means taking proactive steps, like having an evacuation plan, having a fully stocked disaster supply kit. If your local authorities ask you to evacuate, you have to do it. Don't wait.\nAnd so one of the biggest, most important messages that we're going to be delivering throughout hurricane season is that you cannot judge the dangerousness of a hurricane based on the fact that in the past it dissipated or it missed you. If your local authorities say that you need to start evacuating, you need to start evacuating and get it done. Because, oftentimes, despite the enormous progress that we've made technologically and in terms of forecasts, the way that urban centers are designed today, even in areas that are not big metropolises, evacuations take time and people have to respond.\nAnd what we've been seeing is some public complacency slipping in: a large portion of people not having preparedness kits, not having evacuation plans. We've been stagnant a little bit with respect to the number of people, the percentage of people, who respond to an evacuation order. All that has to pick up, because we want to make sure that, although it's hard to prevent property damage, that we are doing everything we can to prevent loss of life.\nIf you need information about how to put together an evacuation plan, how to put together a disaster preparedness kit, as Craig said, we've got an app for everything now. We have a FEMA app in English and in Spanish to help you prepare your family for a disaster. You can update the National Weather Service alerts. You can get safety tips for more than 20 kinds of hazards. It provides you directions to nearby shelters.\nSo I would encourage every American, no matter where you live, to stay vigilant, to check ready.gov. I will repeat that: That is ready.gov. Check that regularly to make sure your family is prepared for severe weather.\nFinally, I just want to thank all the outstanding public servants not only at FEMA, but at NOAA, which does a lot of our forecasting. Our National Hurricane Center—Rick Knabb does a great job. Some of you guys have seen him on TV when things happen. When I came into office, I think FEMA was an organization that was still, as Craig put it, wrapped around the axle. It now exemplifies the extraordinary role that effective Government agencies and the people who work there can play in making our lives better, in saving lives, in helping people pick themselves back up after they've gotten hit with a tremendous blow.\nSo I want to publicly acknowledge not only the outstanding work that Craig has done, the leadership that he's provided here at FEMA, but everybody at FEMA, because they have dealt with everything: hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, flooding, fires. And in every situation, FEMA has been there on time, ready. And I think it's a testament to their effectiveness that very rarely, if ever, have you heard a complaint from a Governor or a mayor or a local community about a lack of responsiveness when it comes to FEMA, no matter what the disaster is.\nBut having said all that, having been really proud of the way that FEMA has operated and all the agencies involved in disaster preparedness have operated over the last 7 years—7½ years, what we also know is, it only takes one. It just takes one big disaster that—for us to really see some severe impacts. What we're always worried about is—are the things we don't know, things we can't anticipate, things that we haven't seen before. And that is why it's so important to make sure that every American, every family participate actively in getting prepared. And if we do that, then we're going to have the kind of resilience that we're all looking for.\nSo thank you very much for the great work that all of you are doing. And we're going to keep on being forward leaning throughout this hurricane season to make sure that we're doing everything we can. We can't control the weather, but we can control our responses to it. And you've got a Government here who's ready to help.\nThanks, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-05-31", "title": "Remarks Following a Hurricane Preparedness Briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency"}
