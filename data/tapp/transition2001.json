Rehnquist administered the oath of office.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25853", "text": "Thank you, all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguished guests, and my fellow citizens. The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.\nAs I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our Nation, and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.\nI am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow. We have a place, all of us, in a long story, a story we continue but whose end we will not see. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, the story of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.\nIt is the American story, a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.\nAmericans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our Nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.\nThrough much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country. It is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. Even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.\nWhile many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.\nOur unity, our Union, is a serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves, who creates us equal, in His image, and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.\nAmerica has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests, and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.\nToday we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion, and character. America at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.\nSome seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.\nWe must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment; it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.\nAmerica at its best is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.\nTogether we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.\nWe will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors. The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.\nWe will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth.\nAmerica at its best is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise. And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.\nAbandonment and abuse are not acts of God; they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers; they are citizensâ€”not problems but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.\nGovernment has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet, compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.\nMany in our country do not know the pain of poverty. But we can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.\nAmerica at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected. Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; it is a call to conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.\nOur public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency, which give direction to our freedom.\nSometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, \"Every day we are called to do small things with great love.\" The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.\nI will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to serve the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it, as well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.\nWhat you do is as important as anything Government does. I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your Nation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: Citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character.\nAmericans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no Government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.\nAfter the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson, \"We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?\"\nMuch time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changes accumulate, but the themes of this day, he would know: our Nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.\nWe are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. Yet, his purpose is achieved in our duty. And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another. Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life. This work continues, the story goes on, and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.\nGod bless you all, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2001-01-20", "title": "Inaugural Address"}

Many have said that it was a defining moment of his Senate career. His supporters say, define him in a way they wanted. Those who--they define him yet a different way.\nMost importantly, your testimony may help us understand what happened, even why it did happen. And so I thank you for being here. We'll hear your testimony. but first, did you have anything you wanted to add?\nAnd, you know, we have these lights; I think I explained the way that worked. We will have your statement, Judge, and then we'll do the usual bit, as I explained, by back and forth. You've been in legislative bodies, you're well-aware of this. But thank you for being here, sir.\nWHITE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch and all members of the Judiciary Committee for inviting me here to testify today. Thank you, twice, for voting in favor of my nomination to the federal District Court in 1999 and 1998. I appreciate this opportunity to tell my story to the United States Senate, and to reclaim my reputation as a judge and a lawyer.\nIt will be up to you, members of the committee, to determine what light this narrative cast on a decision you will make in voting to affirm the next attorney general of the United States.\nI am the oldest son born to teenage parents. When I was born, my mother was 16-years-old and my father was 19-years-old. My mother dropped out of high school in the ninth grade to take care of me. My father worked in the post office, first as a mail sorter and then as station manager.\nAs I grew up, I watched my mother and father work hard, play by the rules and never quite make ends meet. We lived in a unfinished basement home with jagged concrete walls and without a kitchen or bathroom.\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in St. Louis. When I was 10-years-old, I was bused to a grade school in south St. Louis, where kids would throw milk and food at us, and tell us to go back to where we came from.\nThis racism only strengthened my determination. I was not going to let my color, the color of my skin or the ignorance or the hatefulness of others hold me back. I would get the best education I could and I would use that education to make a better life for myself and for my family and for my community.\nMy parents could not afford to pay for my education. Since age 11, I have always worked to earn money. I sold newspapers for half-cents each and I worked as a janitor at a fast-food restaurant. I worked my way through high school, college and law school. Although balancing work and school was not always easy, I struggled through it and made it.\nI have earned my good reputation as a lawyer and a judge by earning the respect of my neighbors. I was elected to the Missouri legislature in 1989. And when I was in the legislature, I was twice selected to be chairman of the judiciary committee. As chair of this committee, I worked with my legislative colleagues, members of the executive branch and citizens and law enforcement officials to strengthen the laws and the application of those laws on behalf of the people of my state.\nIn 1994, I was appointed to the Missouri Court of Appeals by the late governor, Mel Carnahan. One year later, Governor Carnahan appointed me to the Missouri Supreme Court. It is the law in Missouri that state Supreme Court judges are voted on by the people after they have been appointed.\nI came up for a retention vote in 1996 and received more than 1 million votes. I was the first African-American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court, the first in the 175 year history of the court.\nBorn into segregation, I broke this color barrier.\nThe high point of my professional life came in 1998, when President Bill Clinton nominated me to the federal District Court at the suggestion of then Congressman William Clay.\nWhat an amazing feeling for a young man from the inner city of St. Louis. At that moment, I felt that I was living the American dream. If you work hard, no matter your race, class or creed, you can succeed. This is what my parents and million of hard working families throughout this great country dream of for their kids.\nHowever, even though the American Bar Association gave me a unanimous qualified rating, my nomination was not confirmed. I was approved twice by this committee, by votes of 15-3 and 12-6. But I was voted down by the United States Senate at the urging of Senator John Ashcroft.\nWhat happened? When I came before this committee, I was introduced by Senator Kit Bond, who urged my confirmation. Congressman Clay also introduced me and reported to this committee that Senator Ashcroft had polled my colleagues on the Supreme Court--all of whom he had appointed when he was governor--and that they spoke highly of me and said I would make an outstanding federal judge.\nAfter the hearing, we received additional follow-up questions from Senator Ashcroft. The other nominees were asked six questions. I was asked those questions and an additional 15. I answered all of those questions in a full and timely manner. And then, I learned that Senator Ashcroft was opposing me. I was surprised to hear that he had gone to the Senate floor and called me pro-criminal with a tremendous bent towards criminal activity. That he told his colleagues that I was against prosecutors and the culture in terms of maintaining order.\nLEAHY: Inflammatory charges--and they are charges that have always troubled me. And I was concerned in the two days and hours and hours of hearings that Senator Ashcroft never disavowed that language. He had a lot of opportunities to do so in answers to questions by Senator Durbin and a number of others here.\nIn fact, I went back and re-read the three cases in which he convinced his colleagues, his Republican colleagues, to vote against you on October 5. That was the time when they all came out of the Republican caucus, and in a party-line vote that I had never seen before, in a case like this, voted to not allow you to go on the federal bench.\nAnd I hope all senators will read those cases themselves, or consider the two columns written by the noted conservative columnist, Stuart Taylor, in National Journal, over the last two years on these decisions. And I will be inserting those and some other items in the record.\nSo I've thought about this, and it has troubled me for really more than a year. I still don't understand what motivated Senator Ashcroft to fight so hard to have your nomination defeated. I've gone over and over the record. I've talked to him about it.\nI have found something interesting: Senator Ashcroft inserted a short statement in our committee records in May 1998 in which he noted a different reason to oppose your confirmation. He wrote, quote: \"I have been contacted by constituents who are injured by the nominees' manipulation of legislative procedures while a member of the Missouri General Assembly. This contributes to my decision to vote against the nomination.\"\nI wasn't sure what he was talking about so I went back to some of the questions that he had submitted to you--written questions. He asked about a vote you had questioned. So I'd ask you about that.\nThat vote that he asked you about was a vote on restrictive anti-abortion legislation that then-Governor Ashcroft was supporting. Is that correct?\nWHITE: That's correct.\nLEAHY: And do you recall what happened in that incident?\nWHITE: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I was asked this question by Senator Ashcroft regarding that. And here was the answer I gave. The question was: \"I understand that while you served in the state legislature, you called an unscheduled vote that resulted in the defeat of a measure designed to limit abortions. Could you please provide the details of this incident?\"\nHere was my answer: As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I promised to sponsor the legislation, that I would give him a hearing date that was convenient for a majority of the committee members. On the evening in question, the bill sponsor repeatedly demanded that we take up his bill. I objected and stated that we would hear the bill at a later time, after I had had an opportunity to notify all the committee members. The bill sponsor continued to disrupt the committee by speaking loudly without being recognized by the chair. This conduct persisted for at least 15 minutes. Finally, I recognized a committee member who made a motion to bring up the bill. This motion was seconded, and a vote was taken which defeated the measure by a tie vote.\nThis drastic action only occurred as a result of the unruly behavior of the bill sponsor. There was no attempt to deceive the committee members not present by taking a vote behind their backs.\nLEAHY: Now this was--so the sponsor of the bill, which then-Governor Ashcroft supported, as I understand...\nWHITE: I believe that's correct.\nLEAHY: ... he insisted you bring it up. When you brought it up, he lost in a tie vote.\nDo you think this is something that happened years and years ago in a legislative body where people for and against an issue voted on it, do you think this contributed to Senator Ashcroft's efforts--as it turned out successful efforts--to derail your nomination to the federal bench?\nWHITE: Senator, I don't exactly what Senator Ashcroft concerns were, but it caused me a concern when I receive the additional questions, and he specifically asked about that legislation in 1992. And what I've said to you this morning are the facts surrounding that.\nLEAHY: Judge White, you served on the committee--I mean on the bench--with a number of justices who were appointed by then-Governor Ashcroft.\nIs that correct?\nWHITE: That's correct.\nLEAHY: You have had a number of death penalty cases that have come before the court. Do you know how often you have voted the same way, either to uphold or to remand death penalty cases--how many times you've voted in conjunction with those appointed by then-Governor Ashcroft?\nWHITE: I don't have the specific numbers, Mr. Chairman, but I believe that it's about 75 percent of the time. As the numbers indicate, there are 41 of 56 or 58 cases where I have voted to affirm the death penalty.\nLEAHY: Would it surprise you if I told you that a survey done independently finds that you voted with the Ashcroft appointees 95 percent of the time?\nWHITE: Well, not really, because there is not that much variation on those death penalty cases.\nLEAHY: So if you're so completely out of step, they've got to be a bit out of step, too. I mean, that's my point.\nAnd the fact is, on the case that we keep hearing about, this gruesome murder case, is it not a fact that you were not trying to release the person charged with murder; you were just trying to make sure he got a fair trial; is that correct?\nWHITE: That's correct. What I was trying to do was to make sure that the defendant had competent counsel before there was any talk of punishment. And in that case, I urged a new trial so that he could get competent counsel.\nLEAHY: And in your experience, is there any question that in a case like that, if he was found guilty, a jury would in all likelihood recommend the death penalty and that death penalty would be upheld?\nWHITE: I believe so.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Hatch?\nHATCH: Justice White, welcome to the committee, we're happy to have you back before the committee.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nHATCH: And I have a lot of respect for what you went through in your life and how you came up the hard way, how hard you worked. As a former janitor myself, I understand a little bit about that. But let me tell you, I have a lot of respect for you personally.\n(CROSSTALK)\nI just have two questions that maybe I ought to clear up. To your knowledge, did Senator Ashcroft ever actually state that you were calling for Mr. Johnson's release, this fellow who had killed four people?\nWHITE: To my knowledge, he did not.\nHATCH: OK. Now I know that, you know, 10 lawyers can look at a statute and have 10 different opinions and interpret the law in different ways, and that's even true with two-letter words. You know, I mean, we can always get into fights among lawyers.\nBut when you said, referring to your dissent in Johnson, that, quote, \"I based my opinion on sound and settled constitutional law as handed by the Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington,\" unquote, is it not true that you were the only justice on your court who came to that conclusion in that particularly heinous case, and all the other justices, whether appointed by a Republican or a Democrat, disagreed with your interpretation of the Supreme Court settled law?\nWHITE: I was the only judge who came to that conclusion, but all of the judges agreed that the defendant had incompetent counsel. Yet, those judges in the majority didn't get to the prejudice part, where I did. And my separation from them was, I believed that I was following the probable result standard set out in Strickland v. Washington, versus the outcome determinative result that they were.\nHATCH: I understand. Those are the only questions I wanted to ask you. And, again, happy to have you before the committee and I want you treated fairly, as always.\nLEAHY: Senator Kennedy?\nKENNEDY: Justice White, welcome. And I want to thank you very much for agreeing to appear before the committee. I know it's not easy to continue to relive this long ordeal.\nLet me ask you, did Senator Ashcroft ever raise these issues with you prior to the vote in 1999?\nWHITE: No, he did not, Senator.\nKENNEDY: Did he ever give you the opportunity, which you have here today, to be able to explain these positions, or to discuss these positions prior to the time of the vote? Did he ever call you in and let you know what his problems were and ask you for an explanation, give you a reasonable opportunity to answer these kinds of charges that he made against you on the Senate floor?\nWHITE: Senator Kennedy, the only question that he gave me an opportunity to respond to was the question about the pro-anti-choice bill in 1992. I never had an opportunity to discuss the Johnson case.\nKENNEDY: Do you have any idea about why Senator Ashcroft would say--make these charges about your judicial record that were inaccurate? Do you believe you know the reasons why he opposed your candidacy so vociferously?\nWHITE: Senator Kennedy, I don't know exactly what his reasons were, and I'm just trying to lay out the facts and circumstances surrounding the rejection of my nomination, as I believe them to be. I don't know what's in his mind or what's in his heart, so I wouldn't want to speculate on that.\nKENNEDY: Could you just make a brief comment on these kinds of accusations about being pro-criminal, against prosecutors, against maintaining law and order? What's your own view? What's your own attitude? That's an open-ended question, but maybe you could do it, if you could reasonably briefly because of time.\nWHITE: I believe that Senator John Ashcroft seriously distorted my record. But I believe that the question for the Senate is whether these misrepresentations are consistent with fair play and justice that you all would require of the U.S. attorney general, and that would be my position on that.\nKENNEDY: Well, I'd like to make just a couple of more points. We hear a lot of talk these days about what's being called the politics of personal destruction, but what happened to you is 10 times worse than anything that's happened to Senator Ashcroft in the current controversy. In my view, what happened to you is the ugliest thing that's happened to any nominee in all my years in the United States Senate.\nYour record in the Missouri Supreme Court was grossly distorted by Senator Ashcroft. He tried to use your record on death penalty cases to help win his hotly-contested Senate seat in Missouri against Governor Carnahan. And most of us have rarely witnessed so much instant genuine public outrage over what happened so unfairly to you.\nSo it's taken considerable courage for you to come here today, Judge White. I'm pleased that you are here because you've helped to put a very personal and very human face on a very serious injustice.\nMr. Chairman, I have no further questions.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much.\nThe senior senator from Pennsylvania?\nSPECTER: Is it appropriate to call you judge or justice?\nWHITE: It's judge, Senator.\nSPECTER: Judge?\nWHITE: But I'll answer by either one.\nSPECTER: In Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court--or those are called justices, and the lower courts are called judge. But they call you judge?\nWHITE: They call us judges. It sounds a lot more important when you say justice. But in Missouri, we're judges, and the chief judge is justice.\nSPECTER: OK, Judge White, thank you for coming here today. And I think it is useful and appropriate that you've had a chance to state your position.\nThe question which we're focusing here is--and I think you put it well when you said whether it's consistent with fair play and justice in evaluating Senator Ashcroft's qualifications to be attorney general of the United States.\nI think at the outset it ought to be noted publicly that the Senate does not deliberate a great deal on United States District Court judges. That's an unhappy fact of life because of our work load.\nAnd the same applies to the courts of appeals, and these are very, very important positions. When there is a nomination for Supreme Court of the United States, there is a lot of attention. You sort of sometimes judge the attention by the number of television cameras which show up.\nAs you probably noted from your own hearing, there were very few senators present. Customarily there is the presiding senator, and sometimes not even a ranking member of the other side. So that, unless there is some extraordinary incident we, the Senate, does not pay as much attention to the specifics on this confirmation process as it should.\nAnd what happened in your case was that the matter came to a head candidly at the very last minute. And really, in sort of surprising circumstances. So I think in a sense, the Senate owes you an apology for not having more of a focus.\nAnd perhaps, in a situation where we are to reject a nominee, there ought to be special attention. It's OK to pass a nominee without a great deal of fanfare, and there are checks. There is an FBI check and an American Bar Association check, and the staff of the Judiciary Committee makes a check.\nSo that, I don't want to leave the impression that it is a casual matter to be confirmed. But I do think it ought to be stated expressly and understood that senators do not participate as much as perhaps we should because of the workload.\nThe question which I come to, Judge White, is whether Senator Ashcroft did anything but exercise his own judgment in the decision he made as to your nomination.\nI had a very heated controversy with Senator Ashcroft on a Philadelphia state court judge. Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson, who would have been the first African-American woman to be appointed to the United States district court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania.\nAnd I studied her record carefully and knew her to some extent and thought she was qualified for the position. And Senator Ashcroft and others on this committee thought she was not. And we had some very heated hearings on her sentencing policies.\nAnd I had a very sharp disagreement with Senator Hatch who presided at the hearings because she had gone through 50 cases and answered questions and then came in and was confronted with 30 more cases.\nAnd I didn't like the process and I complained about it. It didn't do me any good, but I complained about it.\nBut at the end of that event, I did not question Senator Ashcroft's motives. He thought she was not qualified; I thought she was. I thought he was wrong, and she eventually withdrew. The story has a somewhat happy ending, she is now the president judge of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia, a very distinguished position, perhaps more distinguished than being a federal district court judge.\nSo the question that I have for you, Judge White, is: Do you think that Senator Ashcroft was doing anything other than expressing his own honest views?\nWHITE: Senator, I think he can express his own honest views. But to call me pro-criminal and with a criminal bent, and if you look at the record, the record doesn't support those views.\nSPECTER: I would be inclined to agree that characterizations are not helpful, and they are hurtful. We've had a little sparring with Senator Ashcroft on a number of the things he said. He said people in the middle of the road are either moderates or dead skunks.\nOK? On time?\nLEAHY: You're out of time, but go ahead and finish your thought.\nSPECTER: OK. Well, I saw the red light on. But I want to pursue this a bit.\nSo let's move ahead that his language was intemperate. Do you think that's a disqualification from him being attorney general of the United States?\nWHITE: I don't know what a disqualification would be, Senator. All I'm stating to you are the facts, and the fact is that Senator John Ashcroft seriously distorted my record. I believe the question is for the Senate to answer.\nSPECTER: Well...\nLEAHY: Senator, we will go back for another round.\nSPECTER: Let me just ask one more question at this time.\nLEAHY: I'll give extra time for that one, but then the senator from California will have, also, extra time.\nSPECTER: Senator Bond concurred with Senator Ashcroft. Do you have any reason to question--in opposing your nomination or opposing it forcefully, do you have any reason to question Senator Bond's sincerity on his own judgment?\nWell, what I'm looking for, Judge White, is the sincerity of John Ashcroft and Kit Bond. They may be wrong. They may be intemperate. But looking at Ashcroft's qualifications, I raise the issue as to whether you think they were less than honest or less than sincere? And I throw Senator Bond into the mix. What do you think?\nWHITE: I think the facts of my situation show that Senator Bond came before this committee and spoke very highly of me. What happened between the time I was presented to the committee by Senator Bond and the vote was taken, I don't know.\nSPECTER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: The senator from California--I will try to make sure that the senator from Pennsylvania had extra time there, and we did. But I'm going to have to urge senators to try to keep--both Senator Hatch and I kept actually under our time.\nAnd I say that, because I know a number of senators are on other confirmation hearings, as I am, and several others are today. And they're trying to balance their time back and forth. So in fairness to all senators, we will try to keep very close to the clock. However, the senator from California, because of the balance in here, can have a little bit of extra time. Go ahead.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nJudge White, good morning.\nWHITE: Good morning to you, Senator.\nFEINSTEIN: I'd just like to extend to you my personal apology for what happened to you. I've been on this committee for eight years. I have never seen it happen before. I want you to know that many of us, particularly on our side of the aisle, were totally blind-sided by what happened. It came without warning.\nThe letter from the National Sheriff's Association was distributed on the floor directly with no prior notice to this committee or members of this committee. And I, for one, don't feel it's necessary for anyone to go through that kind of personal humiliation.\nYou have had a good, positive career. And there was no reason for this to happen to you. I just want you to have my personal apology for what did happen.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nFEINSTEIN: During the floor statement on your nomination, Senator Ashcroft said the following, and I quote from the record: \"Judge White has been more liberal on the death penalty during his tenure than any other judge in the Missouri Supreme Court. He has dissented in death penalty cases more than any other judge during his tenure. He has written or joined in three times as many dissents in death penalty cases. And apparently it is unimportant how gruesome or egregious the facts or how clear the evidence of guilt,\" end quote.\nIs this a fair representation of your record? For example, have you written or joined in three times as many dissents in death penalty cases as any other Missouri Supreme Court justice?\nWHITE: Senator, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't believe that that's correct.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, I do have the numbers. Let me just find them here. I have the percentages.\nI think a review of the record shows that you supported death penalty convictions slightly more than the average Missouri Supreme Court justice. You voted over 70 percent of the time to uphold death sentences. And I believe you wrote several majority opinions enforcing a death penalty verdict.\nThe percentage of votes for reversal of a death sentence by Missouri Supreme Court justices were: Ed Thomas (ph)--and I recognized that he's deceased--47 percent; White (ph), 29 percent; Holstein (ph), 25 percent; Price, 24 percent; Benton (ph), 24 percent; and Limbaugh (ph), 22 percent.\nWould you concur with those figures?\nWHITE: Again, Senator, I don't know the numbers. And some of the members of court have been there a little bit longer than me, so the numbers may be skewed a bit.\nBut I would say this: When judging a case, I try to look at the facts of the case and the standard of law that we must apply. And I try not to run around with a score card to determine how many times I'm on this side or that side.\nAnd in every case that comes before me for determination, I give my best on that case. And if the numbers show that, then that's what the numbers show.\nFEINSTEIN: Let me speak about the Kinder case for a moment. In the floor statement on October the 5th, Senator Ashcroft said the following: \"Ronnie White wrote a dissent saying that Missouri v. Kinder was contaminated by a racial bias of the trial judge because that trial judge had indicated that he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties based on that.\"\nWould you describe that as a fair reading of your dissent in Kinder?\nWHITE: No, it's not, Senator. But to get an understanding of my dissent, I think it's proper to read the statement that the trial judge made. And if I may?\nFEINSTEIN: Please do.\nWHITE: In pertinent part, the judge said: \"The truth is that I have noticed in recent years that the Democratic Party places too much emphasis on representing minorities, such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work, and people with a skin that's any color other than white. While minorities needed to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard working taxpayers in this country.\"\nAnd what I said or noted in the opinion was that: \"Conduct suggesting racial bias undermines the credibility of the judicial system and opens the integrity of the judicial system to question.\"\nAnd I stand by that opinion today.\nFEINSTEIN: I believe my time is up.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: The senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI was prepared to refer to you as Justice White. That's the way it's done in my state as well. But Judge White it's a pleasure to have you here today.\nFirst of all, I commend you for the success that you have achieved, especially given the humble background that you spoke of. You can rightly be proud of your appointment to the Missouri Supreme Court. I think it says something both about you, and would you also agree, about the man who appointed you, the late governor, Mel Carnahan.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nKYL: Would it not also say something about the governor who appointed the first African-American to the Missouri Court of Appeals?\nWHITE: It's possible, yes.\nKYL: And of course, you know that is Governor John Ashcroft, the first governor in the history of Missouri--most of whom, by the way, were Democrats--to appoint an African-American to a higher court in Missouri.\nLet me say that I can understand why you are disappointed. I think you have great reason to be disappointed, perhaps even bitterly so, about your defeat in the U.S. Senate. And I personally regret that the vote had to be taken. No one enjoys voting against someone, especially someone who I am sure is trying his or her best to do the best job they can in their office. And I am sure that is precisely what motivates you.\nI did want to clear up just one thing. Senator Leahy said something about the opposition coming out of the Republican caucus. And of course, Republicans did vote against your nomination. We ordinarily don't discuss what is said within our caucuses, our policy luncheons, but let me just allude to this one occasion.\nWe usually devote a couple of minutes to business that's going to be coming up in an afternoon or the next day or two. And John Ashcroft rose and made very brief remarks. They were subdued. He said: \"I am not asking any of you to follow my lead, but since one of the votes is going to be on a Missouri judge, I felt I should at least explain to you why I will be voting no, so as not to blind side any of you.\"\nAnd he spoke very briefly, primarily focusing on the impact of many law enforcement people in the state of Missouri who based their opposition on what some of them suggested were decisions that suggested that you were soft on crime.\nThat is an appellation, by the way, that I don't think should be used.\nNo one ever mentioned your race; in fact, I know that many of my colleagues when they voted were not aware of your race until after the vote.\nI just want to conclude by saying, I think your record can be fairly debated. I am very troubled by some of the things that you have written, but I assure you that I do not believe that you ever intended to misapply the law, and I believe that that is Senator Ashcroft's belief as well.\nWHITE: Thank you.\nLEAHY: I understand the senator from Wisconsin does not have questions. Then we go to the senior senator from New York.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd thank you, Judge White.\nYou are obviously a soft-spoken man, a man of judicious temperament. I can see by your statement and the way you offered it, you're not trying to make points here, just telling what happened. You don't even really seem like a politician.\nSo I'd like to just ask you how you felt when for the first time you heard that your nomination was being called into question because you were called \"soft on crime,\" \"pro-criminal\"?\nWHITE: I was obviously disappointed and upset about the labeling and the name-calling. But what troubled me the most was the lack of opportunity to come in and at least talk with the senators about my record and about the cases that were called into question, and have the kind of discussion that we're having here this morning, where I would be given the chance to speak and you would be given a chance to ask me questions. That was the most troubling aspect of that.\nSCHUMER: During your career in Missouri, had that been a common charge used against you, when you ran for judge, when you ran for other offices in Missouri?\nWHITE: No, Senator, that was not. I had never heard the terms \"pro-criminal,\" \"criminal bent,\" until I heard them on the floor of the Senate on October 4, 1999.\nSCHUMER: Let me ask you to comment on something I feel very strongly about here.\nYou know, I don't believe Senator Ashcroft is a racist, and he has appointed African-American judges and things like that. But I do feel this: I feel that, given America's long and tortured history in terms of race relations, that we have to be ever so careful about applying a double standard, a double standard which has been, well, it was the signature of Jim Crow and everything that has happened since the days of slavery. It's OK for whites to be treated one way, but blacks are treated a different way.\nAnd I don't think this is a philosophical issue. I think every person at this table, from the most conservative to the most liberal, would agree that America must fight hard to avoid a double standard.\nWhat I find so troubling about your nomination is not that someone would call you \"soft on crime,\" whether it's true or not--that's a legitimate issue to debate when we debate judges, and my views on criminal justice are decidedly moderate--but, rather, that a different standard might be used in your nomination than for others who are not of your race.\nAnd if you look at the number of judges that Senator Ashcroft supported, who, at least when you talk to some of the people who prepared the documentation for all those judges, were clearly more liberal on criminal justice and other issues than you, but who were white, and then were voted for without any raising of any questions, it's extremely troubling. To me, it shows real insensitivity to our long and tortured history of racial relations.\nAnd would you care to comment on that thought? Am I off base here? Do you think it applied to you? Tell me what you think.\nWHITE: Senator, first let me say, I don't think Senator Ashcroft is a racist, and I wouldn't attempt to comment on what's in his mind or what's in his heart. But the answer I would give to your question is this: There was a lot of outrage about my nomination being rejected and particularly in the African-American community. And the reason for that outrage, I believe, is that when you have an African-American judge, African-Americans see that as one more step towards true equality.\nSo when that judge rules, whatever way it is, there shouldn't be any hint of racism or any underhanded dealing because there is a sense that that person gives it their best. So that would be my explanation for the outrage behind my rejection.\nSCHUMER: Do you think there was the feeling that a double standard was used in opposing your nomination?\nWHITE: Yes.\nSCHUMER: One final question. Because this whole episode is terribly difficult, I think, for so many of us on both sides of the aisle here.\nOver the past few days, Senator Ashcroft has spoken at length about his concern for civil rights and his sensitivity to issues of race. Does anything he has said in the last few days here at this hearing give you reassurance?\nWHITE: Senator, I have not really watched his testimony, but I would just say to you again, I do believe he seriously distorted my record, and I'm here this morning to attempt to try to set that record straight.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nThe senior senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine?\nDEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\nJudge White, thank you very much for coming in. We very much appreciate your testimony.\nAnd Mr. Chairman, I do not have any questions.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nThe senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, was at another hearing, I believe, and he's now here. Then we'll turn to the senator from Wisconsin.\nFEINGOLD: Mr. Chairman, let me just say--I apologize to the witness. I had to introduce the governor of the state of Wisconsin to the Finance Committee, as did Senator Kohl, and I recognize the tremendous importance of your testimony, which I will read and then perhaps ask questions later.\nLEAHY: Thank you. I have noted for the record that a number of senators, both Republicans and Democrats, are at a series of confirmation hearings. That's why they are not here.\nThen we would go to the senior senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\nDURBIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd Judge White, thank you for joining us.\nI only wish that every member of the Senate could hear your testimony. I only wish that they could hear your life story, even those who voted against you, and reflect on the decision that they made. I hope that they would ask themselves whether the person that they would be listening to is the same person that was described by John Ashcroft on the floor of the United States Senate.\nWe have been asked by President-elect Bush to look into the hearts of his nominees. And during the last two days, we have entertained the testimony of Senator John Ashcroft about what is really in his heart. Over and over again, Senator Ashcroft told us that as attorney general, he would be results-oriented--he would not be results-orientated, he would be law orientated.\nIn your case, he was clearly results-orientated and not law orientated. Because had he looked at the law and how you applied it, he never would have said the words he did about you on the floor of the United States Senate.\nThose of us--and I live in Missouri, a neighbor--pardon me, in Illinois, a neighbor of Missouri--and those of us who followed the senatorial race know what was going on there in this situation. There was a result that Senator Ashcroft was seeking. He was trying to create a death penalty issue in the Missouri senatorial campaign. Why? Because the late-governor Mel Carnahan had spared a man in death row after a personal appeal by the pope when he visited St. Louis.\nAnd you, Judge White, were the victim of this political calculation. Your hard work through a lifetime, your good name, and your reputation were cast aside after the political calculation was made. That to me is a reflection on the heart of the man who wants to be our attorney general.\nThis position in the Cabinet, more than any other, is entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the civil rights of Americans. We count on the law not only being there but people who will implement and enforce the law with a good heart.\nWe have a president who will be sworn in in a few hours who has pledged to unite us and not divide us. And as we listen to your testimony, and as senator after senator apologizes for what happened to you and your good name, is there any doubt that what happened was divisive, divisive for you and your family and for America.\nYesterday, when I asked Senator Ashcroft about this he said, \"Well, the law enforcement organizations were against Ronnie White--soft on crime, not strong on the death penalty.\"\nJudge White, when it came to the support of law enforcement organizations for your appointment to the federal district court, what is the record?\nWHITE: That's not true that I was opposed to law enforcement.\nSenator Durbin, I have a brother-in-law who is a police officer in St. Louis. I have a cousin who is a police officer in St. Louis. I've served on boards and commissions with police officers in the St. Louis community. And I also, when I was city counselor for the city of St. Louis, was the lawyer for the St. Louis City Police Department, and we defended police officers.\nAs a judge, all I've tried to do is to apply the law as best I could and the way I saw it.\nDURBIN: Judge White, I noted with interest during the course of this hearing that even though the grizzly details of the Johnson case and the Kinder case were brought out yesterday, nobody has mentioned them while you're sitting here. No one from the other side has brought them up. Those are grizzly details in the Johnson case. And I want you to explain why you dissented in that case. This man brutally murdered, apparently murdered, four or five people, including a sheriff in execution style, and you dissented in the question of whether or not the death penalty should have been imposed. Please explain.\nWHITE: The details in any murder case are grizzly. Death in a normal consequence is really bad. But the cornerstone of our criminal justice system is a right to a fair trial. And all I was trying to get to in the Johnson case was, the lawyer's ineffective assistance to the defendant possibly affected the jury's determination in guilt and sentencing. I did not say that these facts were not awful.\nI did not say that that family didn't suffer. All I was trying to do was to ensure that Johnson had a fair trial. And in my mind, the only way you can have that is to have competent counsel, and then I think the consequences will flow from there.\nDURBIN: Did you call for his release in your dissent?\nWHITE: No, I did not. I just urged a retrial. But I think the impression was created that, since I voted to reverse in the case, that Johnson would be released.\nAnd if I might say further, when we rule on a death case in Missouri, that case goes to the federal court system for review. And in writing my dissenting opinion, I was writing to the next level of review to say, \"Look, there's a difference of opinion on my court about how to apply the standard in Strickland v. Washington. Help us. Tell us who's right. Am I right or are they right?\" And that was all I was I trying to get to.\nDURBIN: Let me close by saying this: I am very sorry for what Senator Ashcroft did to you and your reputation. And I join with my colleagues in apologizing for what happened to you before the United States Senate.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nDURBIN: Thank you.\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions.\nSESSIONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd, Judge White, we're glad to have you here. I think it's good for this committee to allow you to share your thoughts and concerns about the way the process was for you.\nI agree with you that this gaggle of blow-hards sitting in this Senate are not particularly good at making these decisions. I've seen a lot of decisions come out of this committee that I haven't been happy with, but it is a system. And they do vote and that's it. And we have to live with it.\nAnd you're blessed, I think, with the ability to remain as justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri, a great and august position. I hope that you will enjoy it. And I hope that you would not succumb to, as some suggested, bitterness or ill feeling. It looks like you're not.\nWHITE: No, Senator Sessions, I'm not bitter at all.\nSESSIONS: You've got a great career. You've had a good career. And we validate that.\nI've been a prosecutor for 15-plus years. I feel strongly about those issues.\nJohn Ashcroft was attorney general for quite a number of years. John was attorney general and I was a prosecutor during the time this country began to refigure what we were doing about criminal justice.\nIt seemed more and more that the law schools were teaching that this was almost like a game. A judge was sort of like a umpire or referee. And he threw the flag for minor or insignificant offenses by the police, calling for retrial for defendants to be released.\nThere's some intellectual support still alive today for that. People still believe in that, that we are insufficiently protective today since we've changed. I don't. I believe firmly that we need to focus on guilt and innocence, and we ought not to be so focused on errors that had little or no impact on the outcome of the trial.\nAnd a lot of reasons I think that was--and I've looked at a number of your opinions, and I think your views may be consistent with quite a body of intellectual and liberal thought on crime in America. It's not what I would want.\nAnd John Ashcroft voted for 26 of 27 judges that were African-American that President Clinton put up. His problem was you were his judge, and his sheriffs, 77 of them, had opposed you, chiefs' of police association opposed you, prosecutors.\nI feel an obligation, implicit in my election, was that I would watch to make sure that the federal judges that are appointed are going to be fair to the police officers and sheriffs and prosecutors I served with. Do you think you could understand John's approach, that that may have been a factor in his thinking?\nWHITE: I can understand his approach, but I can't understand his distortion of my record.\nSESSIONS: Well, you know, it's a difference of opinion. Like in the Kinder case that was alleged here, this judge made some insensitive, maybe, at best, remarks. Perhaps this judge may have even been subject to censure. Was he ever censured, do you know?\nWHITE: No, he was never censured.\nSESSIONS: Subject to censure. But what troubled me was, you reversed his decision, saying that actual fairness of the trial was not sufficient, that even though there was no showing that he made a single error against the defendant, you voted to reverse his case. That troubled me. Would you like to comment on that?\nWHITE: Yes, Senator, because in my mind, his comments created a sense of judicial bias from the outset. When he made these statements about five or six days before trial, then he goes into court and says, \"I can be a fair and impartial judge.\"\nAnd I will say to you, as you know, a judge is a judge all the time. And you don't stop being a judge in one instance and be a judge in the next.\nSESSIONS: Well, I would disagree. I would believe that if the judge conducted a fair trial, there was not one hint that he did anything to bias that case, the case should not be reversed.\nI was aware of some of the programs that were set up, put up a sign, \"Drug dealers are going to be stopped ahead.\" And what they found was, drug dealers would stop and make U-turns in the street and things like that, and police would stop them, and they wouldn't excessively--they wouldn't just search their car based on that, they would make inquiries and sometimes ask the occupant of the car if they could search the car.\nYou voted in dissent, I believe, that that procedure was unfair because the highway traveler would be tricked. That troubled me.\nWell, I see my time is up. I won't get into the Johnson case except to say, those were, would you not agree, some skilled attorneys that were defending him. Those are retained attorneys with Mr. Inge (ph), had 10 years of practice, teaches criminal law. And another lawyer, Mr. Bly (ph), was an active litigator, having won awards and done some teaching. It was a pretty good group of retained attorneys, was it not?\nWHITE: Well, one of the lawyers was basically a solo lawyer, and I think that the public defenders in Missouri have substantial experience, probably more experience than private attorneys in handling death penalty cases because they handle many more.\nSESSIONS: Well, Mr. Inge (ph) teaches criminal practice skill courses for the criminal law section of the Missouri Bar Association. He received an award from the Criminal Defense Bar, the Host Award from the Missouri Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He was a member of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers for 14 years, sat on the board of directors, and currently serves as vice president of the Missouri Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. This was a quality civil attorney. He was a good partner, I would suggest. Plus a third attorney, Christine Carpenter (ph), who apparently has good skills. I don't think they were...\nWHITE: I mean, that's why these errors don't make any sense. I mean, you had all that skill and record there, when all they had to do was pick up the phone, contact the witnesses and try to figure it out.\nSESSIONS: My view was, they just simply put on a defense that was proven unfounded, and the jury found...\nLEAHY: Could we--I don't mean to interrupt, but we've gone considerably over time, and I'm trying, again, at the request of senators on both sides, I've been trying to keep on time.\nThe senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nJustice White, again, thanks for being here. I now have had an opportunity to read your statement. I'm told by my colleagues that hearing it is even more moving than certainly simply reading it is. And I want to join Senator Durbin in the apology.\nWHITE: Thank you.\nFEINGOLD: The rejection of your nomination was unjustified. And I particularly regret that it was an entirely partisan vote.\nI think we were all shocked and the more I, of course, read about some of the facts, it is a regrettable moment in the Senate. And, at a minimum, I'm glad that you have an opportunity here to get the record straight on some of these points.\nIn fact, just as a brief response to Senator Sessions' characterization of the comments of the trial judge in the Kinder case, the notion that these remarks here are insensitive at best is something I would take issue with. A direct contrasting of minorities with the hardworking taxpayers in this country, to me, isn't beyond insensitive, and I simply wish to make, on the record, the remark that I think that these are shocking remarks for a trial judge.\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, may I correct myself?\nLEAHY: Please.\nSESSIONS: I think insensitive--I meant to say insensitive at worst. They were very bad comments that...\nFEINGOLD: Excuse me, Mr. Sessions...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSESSIONS: ... and I didn't...\nFEINGOLD: ... they were insensitive at worst, I think they go...\nSESSIONS: I didn't say that and I apologize for any inaccurate...\nFEINGOLD: ... well beyond that.\nMr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: Yes?\nFEINGOLD: My apology for getting that wrong. I find it hard to imagine these words simply being called insensitive at worst. The hardworking people of Wisconsin would consider them to be far beyond insensitive.\nMr. Chairman, one item that I assume you'd like to set the record straight on is that, in opposing your nomination to the federal bench, Senator Ashcroft was highly critical of your dissent in a case called State v. DeMask (ph). This was a Fourth Amendment case that the Missouri Supreme Court decided in 1996 and you offered the dissenting opinion.\nThe case addressed the constitutionality of drug interdiction check points in two Missouri counties. Police officers dressed in camouflage were stopping motorists in the dark of the night at the end of a lonely exit ramp and looking for evidence to allow them to search the vehicles for drugs.\nThe majority of the Missouri Supreme Court decided that these stops were constitutional but you dissented. You agreed with you and your colleagues that trafficking in illegal drugs is a national problem of the most-severe kind and you agreed that traffic stops such as these could be conducted in a reasonable way. But you found that these particular checkpoint operations were not conducted in a reasonable way and were, therefore, unconstitutional.\nAnd then just a few months ago, a case with facts very similar to the Missouri case made its way to the United States Supreme Court. In the City of Indianapolis v. Edmund (ph), the U.S. Supreme Court found that drug interdiction checkpoints like the ones that were upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court are unconstitutional. The Edmund (ph) case makes clear that the police may not set up roadblocks in the hope of interdicting drugs or detecting some other criminal wrongdoing. In fact, the United States went in even farther in protecting the rights of motorists than you were prepared to go in your dissent. But I don't think anybody really considers the Rehnquist court to be pro-criminal.\nIn light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, would you agree that the majority decision in DeMask (ph) would now be considered bad law?\nWHITE: That's correct, Senator. In fact, I was vindicated by the United States Supreme Court by their decision when they said those kind of checkpoints were unconstitutional.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you again, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Feingold.\nThe senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback.\nBROWNBACK:: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Justice White. Delighted to have you here at the committee.\nI heard your opening statement. I was watching it and it was very powerful. A real success story of pulling yourself up by the boot straps in very difficult circumstances and conditions, and I applaud that. I applaud what you've attained and what you're doing and what you continue to do.\nI appreciate as well your willingness to come here and testify in a difficult circumstance and condition that we've got as we're trying to review and to look at one of the former members of our body making the move from a legislative branch to an executive branch position, from one that makes decisions voting on judges to one on enforcing the law. And there are different qualifications and criteria that people look at in those sorts of shifts.\nWhere John Ashcroft was in your state, was attorney general for two terms in your state, there are no allegations that he didn't enforce the law and bring it forth with equal justice, the head of the attorney general's association, National Attorney General's Association, in enforcing law.\nSo while they are points, I think, that have been validly made. I think we're looking at now, what would a person do in enforcing the law and would they do that equally and fairly.\nAnd while I think you raise legitimate points about your confirmation, there is also concerns that were being raised at that time about support for you from the law enforcement community or lack of support, really, thereof.\nAnd here was, you know, a key area where the law enforcement community need to have comfort as well in your abilities as a judge in that particular condition.\nSo I appreciate very much your background, the words and the information you bring in front of us. There were challenges--legitimate ones, I think, at that time--ones that can be questioned. But when you look at a lifetime appointment to the bench, you really weigh those carefully and look at them cautiously when considering that lifetime appointment.\nAnd I have no doubt that you're going to continue in a great role in public service. And after the difficult circumstances, after today, we will all move on forward, and you will serve well and serve with distinction.\nBut those questions being raised at that time on a lifetime appointment I think caused a number of people pause.\nThank you for being here today.\nMr. Chairman, I have no questions.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nLEAHY: I will put into the record an editorial from the St. Louis Post Dispatch in which they quote Charles Blackbar (ph), retired Supreme Court judge, who called Senator Ashcroft's attack on Judge White as quote, \"tampering with the judiciary.\" I'll put that in the record. I'll put in the record from the National Journal an article by Stuart Taylor in which he says that Senator Ashcroft smeared Judge Ronnie White for his own partisan political purposes. I will also put into the record a strong letter of support and endorsement from the chief of police of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department for Judge White during his confirmation time, and also from the Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of the Police, which indicated on behalf of 4,500 law enforcement officers in Missouri that they view Justice White's record as quote, \"one of the jurors whose record on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than the rights of criminals,\" close quote. I'll put that in the record.\nAnd, Judge White, listening to the senators here, I feel that, as Senator Durbin and Senator Kennedy and so many others have said, that this was not a question of your rulings on cases, rulings which appear to be well in the mainstream--in fact, one case presupposed or predated a similar ruling made by conservative U.S. Supreme Court, the Rehnquist court--but rather that you became a political pawn.\nNow, I disagreed with Senator Ashcroft on the floor of the Senate when this happened. I disagreed with him in our personal meetings, and I disagreed with him in these hearings. I won't go more with that, but I still disagree with him, even more so, having heard you.\nYou have sterling credentials. You've had a career that is exemplary by any standards and one that so many people, white or black, would want to emulate. I think your career was besmirched. I believe your career was besmirched, not on a question of you legal abilities, because your legal abilities are golden--they've been proven. But they were besmirched to aid Senator Ashcroft's political fortunes. That, sir, is wrong. I am sorry to have seen that happen. It will be an issue in this confirmation as will others. But as a United States senator, it disturbs me greatly.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator.\nHATCH: If I could just add one comment myself. Judge White, I called you Justice White--as far as I'm concerned that's good enough.\nWHITE: That's fine.\nHATCH: Both are good.\nBut let me just say that I think you've been more gracious here toward Senator Ashcroft here than some of our colleagues.\nI just want to compliment you for it...\nWHITE: Thank you.\nHATCH: ... and let you know that I respect you for it. And I appreciate you being here and accept your testimony. That's it.\nWHITE: Thank you, Senator Hatch.\nLEAHY: If there are no further questions, the committee will...\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, are we going to have a second round?\nLEAHY: I just asked if there were any more. If there are no further questions, the committee will stand in recess for a few minutes to allow the staff to set up the tables for the next one.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: I should note while we're waiting for Senator Hatch to come, I had a good discussion this morning with Congressman Hulshof and cleared up any misunderstanding I might have about his letter to me. And I appreciate the letter. I don't know if the congressman is in here right now, but I appreciated that conversation. It was very helpful.\nNow that Senator Hatch is here, we will begin.\nWe have a large and distinguished panel. We have the Honorable Edward \"Chip\" Robertson, a lawyer and former justice of the Missouri Supreme Court; Ms. Harriet Woods, whom I know, and the former lieutenant governor of Missouri; Jerry Hunter, Mr. Jerry Hunter a lawyer and former labor secretary of Missouri; Mr. Frank Susman, lawyer from Gallop, Johnson, Neuman of St. Louis; Ms. Kate Michelman, who is the president of NARAL, here in Washington; Ms. Gloria Feldt is the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America; Ms. Marsha Greenberger, who is the co-president of the National Women's Law Center, Washington, D.C.; Ms. Colleen Campbell, member of Memory of Victims Everywhere, from one of the prettiest areas there is, San Juan Capistrano, California. If I misstated the actual names of the organizations, trust me, we'll get it right before the day is over.\nWhat I want to do is have--each witness will have five minutes. I suggest and we are going--because they're so many--we are going to have to run the clock pretty strictly. Your whole statement, of course, will be part of the record. My experience is that there's something you really want us to remember the most, you may want to emphasis, but I will leave it any way you want to go.\nAnd so, Judge Robertson, we'll start with you, and move from my right to the left.\nROBERTSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Edward D. Robertson, Jr., I am a partner in the law firm of Bartimus, Frickleton, Robertson and Obetz, and we have offices in Kansas City and Jefferson City, Missouri.\nI appear before you today to speak on behalf of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney general of the United States.\nLEAHY: Could you pull the microphone just a little bit closer, please, Mr. Robertson?\nROBERTSON: OK.\nI do so from the vantage point of one who served as the deputy attorney general of Missouri from 1991 until--sorry, from 1981 until 1985, at a time when John Ashcroft was attorney general.\nOn March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson addressed the people of the United States in his first inaugural address. He acknowledged the rancor that marked his election, but he stated, \"Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.\"\nIf press accounts are accurate, it appears that some of the members of the Senate may disagree with John Ashcroft's opinions. I trust, however, that none of you disagrees with the principle on which he will found every decision he makes as attorney general of the United States, should you confirm him. That principle requires that the rule of law, established by Congress and interpreted by courts, will prevail, must prevail, as he carries out his duties as attorney general.\nAs attorney general of Missouri, John Ashcroft issued officials opinions concluding, for example, that evangelical religious materials could not be distributed at public school buildings in Missouri. And you have heard a number of those opinions discussed previously in this hearing, and I will not list them for you now.\nIf one believes Senator Ashcroft's critics, each of these opinions should have reached a different result. But they did not for one overriding reason: then-Attorney General Ashcroft let settled law control the directives and advice he gave Missouri government.\nNow, I do not intend to take much more of the committee's time with these prepared remarks, as there are so many of us, and I'm sure you have questions for all of us.\nI have known John Ashcroft for nearly a quarter of a century. If we could boil him down to one single essence, we would find a man for whom his word is both a symbol and a revelation of his deepest values. This means one thing to me, one thing to which nearly a quarter of a century has failed to provide a single, contrary example: When John Ashcroft gives his word, he will do what he says, period.\nThose who are with me at the table have opinions, some of them, that differ from Senator Ashcroft's opinions. But they, like the members of this committee, of the Senate, and every American, can count on John Ashcroft's word. When he tells you that he will follow the settled law, he will follow the law. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much.\nMs. Woods?\nWOODS: Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, members of the committee, I am here to provide information that I hope will help you to decide whether to confirm John Ashcroft as attorney general.\nI have to say, which John Ashcroft? I've listened to these hearings and heard him say that he will conform to Roe v. Wade, that he will support mandatory trigger locks. You understand that, in Missouri, over and over, he has shown an absolute dedication to the overturn of Roe v. Wade, campaigned for concealed weapons.\nI will try to sample in my very brief remarks a number of cases where I feel that he has pushed particular agenda or ideological values rather than administer justice in an even-handed manner.\nBut I also have to ask, is this--in his testimony, he was proud of having set records for appointing women and minorities? He had an abysmal record in appointing women, so much so that he was cited for having the lowest number of executive appointments of any governor in this country, and he never reached any more in his whole term. He appointed exactly 10 women out of 121 judicial appointments. He didn't appoint the first one until he was more than half way through his first term as a result of really heavy publicity even on the front page of newspapers condemning him in the record of Missouri.\nAs for the minority appointments, I'm sure other people will talk about them. But when he says he created a record, I have to point out that the two previous governors--one had appointed no black judges and the other, three. So that he set a record of eight I really applaud. But the next administration appointed 30. So we have to put this all in perspective.\nGovernors love to say, \"Well, he could only appoint people as they were presented by the panels.\" They never say that the governors appoint the members of the commission, at least two out of the five. And in at least one case, Governor Ashcroft appointed a minister on the commission in Kansas City, who was quoted in the newspaper as saying he didn't believe women belonged on the bench. You would not be surprised that not many women applied.\nSo this is a lot more complicated.\nYou know, I respect Governor Ashcroft, Senator Ashcroft, he has lifted his hand and says he swears to uphold the law. He swore to uphold the law in Missouri also.\nIn 1985, when both of us were sworn in, one as governor and one as lieutenant governor, the odd couple, of course--I'm a Democrat, he's a Republican. He said to me, \"I could find useful things for you to do, but in return you will have to give up the authority to serve as the governor in my absence, when I leave the state.\" I was really stunned. I said well, \"Why? I mean, I certainly would do nothing to in any way misuse that power. I want to cooperate with you. I have every motive to cooperate with you. I can't unilaterally give up a constitutional duty.\" He said, \"That's not the way I read the law.\" And he left the state without notifying me or the secretary of state.\nHe didn't at that time contest this in the courts. He didn't say let's get this law changed. Ultimately, it was ridiculous. And the only recourse I had was clearly to go to the press and I said so. Finally, they slipped a note under my door that he was leaving the state, and we had no further problem. But he raised the same thing with my successor Mel Carnahan, poisoning the atmosphere with him.\nUltimately WE did go to court. The court said his authority did extend when he was outside the state, but the judge added, he really ought to work with the lieutenant governor to better serve the people of the state.\nI'm sure you will hear about a '78 case in which he chose, under the antitrust laws, to prosecute the National Organization for Women for conducting boycotts of the state for failing to ratify the ERA. He was turned down at the district court; he was turned down at the appellate court; the Supreme Court rejected it. It's very unclear to me whether the fact that he opposed the ERA was more a motivation than whether he was really properly using the laws of the state to uphold the law.\nIn 1989, very quickly, after the Webster decision, he appointed a task force in which he appointed--for women's health care and children--in which he named only people who were opposed to abortion. The leaders in the legislature were so outraged that they said they wouldn't participate. How could this reflect all the interests of the state?\nAnd this was not the only case where he had done something like this. In 1999, a distinguished Republican, a former Supreme Court justice, Charles Blackmon (ph) said in a footnote in a Law Journal article about Senator Ashcroft's hearing on judicial activism, \"I wrote Senator Ashcroft several times requesting information on the hearings and offering to testify and to provide a written statement. I received no reply. The witness lists seemed to consist of individuals whose views harmonized with those of the senator.\"\nA case that's been cited that he followed the law in not having Bibles distributed in public schools. What they do not say is that Missouri became, I think, the final state that provided no licensing for church-run day care centers, even when they very carefully amended it to say, \"We will not interfere with what is said there,\" but there has to be some minimum health and safety for children. John Ashcroft was protecting those church-run schools instead to the very end.\nI have, obviously, no more time. I hope that if there are any questions, particularly about the myths about why the 2001 election, or overriding that, the racial issues in Missouri, which I think are so important, I'll be glad to respond.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nMr. Hunter?\nHUNTER: Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, ranking member Senator Hatch, and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is indeed a pleasure and honor for me to be here today to testify in support of President-elect George W. Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft to be attorney general of the United States.\nBased upon my personal knowledge and relationship with Senator Ashcroft, I believe he is eminently qualified to hold the position of attorney general. I have known Senator Ashcroft since 1983, and I have had the pleasure to work with him as an adviser, a subordinate during the period I was director of the Missouri Department of Labor, from 1986 to 1089, and as a friend and supporter.\nDuring the period that I've known Senator Ashcroft, I have always known him to be a person of the utmost integrity and an individual who is concerned about others. Contrary to statements which you have just recently heard and will hear from others during this hearing, I do not believe Senator Ashcroft is insensitive to minorities in this society, and I think the record, which has been laid out by Senator Ashcroft, clearly contradict these allegations.\nLike President-elect George W. Bush, Senator Ashcroft followed a policy of affirmative access and inclusiveness during his service to the state of Missouri as attorney general, his two terms as governor, and his one term in the United States Senate.\nDuring the eight years that Senator Ashcroft was attorney general for the state of Missouri, he recruited and hired minority lawyers. During his tenure as governor, he appointed blacks to numerous boards and commissions. And Mrs. Woods--my good friend, Mrs. Woods--referred to that, but I would say to you on a personal note, Senator Ashcroft went out of his way to find African-Americans to consider for appointments.\nIn fact, it was shortly after then-Governor Ashcroft took office in January of 1985 that I received a call from one of the governor's aides who advised me that the governor wanted me to help him to locate minorities that he could consider for appointments to various state boards and commissions and positions in state government. At the time I was employed in private industry in St. Louis as a corporate attorney. I certainly was pleased that the governor had asked me to assist the administration in helping him to locate and recruit African-Americans that he could consider for appointments.\nDuring his tenure as governor, John Ashcroft appointed a record number of minorities to state boards and commissions, including many boards and commissions which previously had no minority representation. Governor Ashcroft also appointed eight African-Americans to state court judgeships during his tenure, including the first African-American to serve on the state appellate court in the state of Missouri and the first African-American to serve as a state court judge in St. Louis County. Governor Ashcroft did not stop with these appointments. He approved the appointment of the first African-Americans to serve as the administrative law judges for the Missouri Division of Workers' Compensation in St. Louis City, St. Louis County and Kansas City.\nWhen Governor Ashcroft's term ended in January of 1993, he had appointed more African-Americans to state court judgeships than any previous governor in the history of the state of Missouri. Governor Ashcroft was also bipartisan in his appointment of state court judges. He appointed Republicans, Democrats and independents. One of Governor Ashcroft's black appointees in St. Louis was appointed, notwithstanding the fact that he was not a Republican and that he was on a panel with a well-known white Republican. Of the nine panels of nominees for state court judgeships, which included at least one African-American, Governor Ashcroft appointed eight black judges from those panels.\nAnd in appointing African-Americans to the state court bench, Governor Ashcroft did not have any litmus tests and none of his appointees to the state court bench, be they black or white, were asked his or her position on abortion or any other specific issue, and I know this because I talked to many of the black nominees prior to their interview and talked to many of the black nominees after their interview. Governor Ashcroft's appointment, in fact, of the first black to serve on the bench in St. Louis County was so well received that the Mound City Bar Association of St. Louis, one of the oldest black bar associations in this country, sent him a letter commending him.\nAs an individual who was personally involved in advising Governor Ashcroft on appointments from 1985 through 1992, and as one who served as the director of the Missouri Department of Labor under Governor Ashcroft from 1986 through 1989, I can unequivocally state that the regard which he was held in in the minority community during his tenure as governor was of the highest regard. Mr. Ashcroft's record of affirmative access and inclusiveness also includes his support of and later signing of legislation to establish a state holiday in order of Dr. Martin Luther King during 1986.\nSince 15 years have passed since the passage of the legislation in Missouri which created the holiday in honor of Dr. King, many individuals here today probably have forgotten the opposition which existed in the legislature to the establishment of Dr. King's birthday as a state holiday. The King bill had been introduced in the legislature for numerous years and many of those years the bill never got out of committee, and most years it certainly didn't pass either House or the legislature. It was not until 1986, after then-Governor Ashcroft announced his support for the King holiday bill that the legislation sailed through the legislature and was ultimately signed by Ashcroft.\nAnd following the conclusion of the ceremony where Governor Ashcroft signed the King holiday bill, I went into the governor's office and privately thanked him for signing the bill and Governor Ashcroft responded to me by saying: \"Jerry, you do not have to thank me. It was the right thing to do.\"\nBecause of his sensitivity to the need for role models from minority communities, then-Governor Ashcroft established an award in honor of African-American educator George Washington Carver. He also signed legislation making ragtime composer Scott Joplin's house the first historic site honoring an African-American in the state of Missouri.\nMr. Chairman, I see my time is up. I would like to make to one final point and would be happy to respond to any questions. When Governor Ashcroft sought re-election in the state of Missouri as governor during 1988, he was endorsed by the Kansas City Call newspaper, which is a well-respected black weekly newspaper in the state of Missouri. And in that election, he received over 64 percent of the vote in his re-election campaign for governor.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Hunter. And you're correct; you did go overtime. I'm trying to be as flexible as I can, but there are a lot of other witnesses. And were hoping that by late tomorrow night we might have this whole hearing finished.\nHATCH: We're hoping by late tonight to get this hearing over, and there's no reason not to.\nLEAHY: I think closed down--I think they told all federal employees to go home at 2:00 this afternoon because President-elect Bush and Ricki Martin are having a party...\nHATCH: We know how hard you work, Senator. We know your willing to...\nLEAHY: But I don't want to interfere with president-elect and Ricki Martin.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHATCH: Well, I do if that's what it's going to--if it's going to put us into tomorrow...\nLEAHY: ... you think he's better...\nHATCH: This is a good show.\nLEAHY: Mr. Susman...\nSUSMAN: If you'd be kind enough to reset the clock, I'll stay with the...\nLEAHY: I'm looking at the clock, myself, and it's saying--there we go. By the way, it's almost there. You've got it.\nSUSMAN: Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, members of the committee, I appreciate your invitation and this opportunity to share my thoughts in the pending nomination of John Ashcroft as attorney general of the United States.\nUp front, let me state, I strongly oppose this nomination. I'm a practicing attorney in Missouri with a long history of handling matters involving health care, particularly as they relate to women, contraception, and abortion.\nAlthough a minor part of my law practice, I've been counsel in at least six cases involving these issues before the United States Supreme Court, three additional cases before the Missouri Supreme Court, as well as numerous other cases in courts throughout the United States.\nDomestically, the Cabinet position of attorney general is the most powerful of any. The attorney general has the ability to shape the future of the Senate Judiciary through his or her involvement in judicial appointments, through the 641 district court positions, the 179 circuit courts of appeal positions, and the nine Supreme Court positions.\nThe attorney general does much more than merely enforce the laws of this land. The attorney general is able to influence legislation merely by the persuasive powers of the office. It is myopic to believe that the office possesses no discretion in interpreting the laws of the land, particularly on legal issues neither previously no clearly decided by the Supreme Court.\nThe attorney general has the discretion to select which laws should be given priority in enforcement through control of the purse and the assignment of other resources.\nBased upon the nominees consistent public statements and public actions over many years, I have no doubt that he would use the powers of the office to shape the judiciary and the law to his own personal agenda, at the great expense of women, minorities, and our current body of constitutional and statutory law.\nHistory is indeed a reliable precursor to the future. While Missouri's attorney general, the nominee issued a legal opinion seeking to undermine the state's nursing practice act. He opined the taking of medical history, the giving of information, and the dispensing of condemns, IUDs, and oral contraceptives, the performance of breast exams, pelvic exams, and pap smears, the testing for sexually transmitted diseases and the providing of counseling and community education by nurse practitioners constituted the criminal act of the unauthorized practice of medicine.\nEach of these services were, at that time, routine health care practices, provided by Missouri nurses for many years, and in fact, were being provided by nurses within the states own county health departments.\nAs directly related to the case Sirmky vs. Gonzales (ph) filed by impacted physicians and nurses, these nursing activities were being provided in federally designated low-income counties in which there was not a single physician who accepted as eligible women patients for prenatal care and childbirth because of the low fee reimbursement schedules established by the state of Missouri.\nThis opinion by the nominee provided the impetus for the state's board of registration for the healing arts to threaten the plaintiff physicians and nurses with a show cause order as to why criminal charges should not be brought against them.\nImplementation of the nominee's opinion would have eliminated the cost effective and readily available delivery of these essential services to indigent women, who often utilize county health departments as their primary health care provider, and would have shut and bolted the door to all poor women who relied upon these services as their only means to control their fertility. A unanimous Missouri Supreme Court struck down the nominee's interpretation of the nursing practice act.\nDuring the nominee's term as governor of Missouri, family planning funding was limited to the lowest amount necessary to achieve matching federal Medicaid funds.\nAnd during this same period of time, teenage pregnancies in Missouri increased. The nominee vigorously opposed the Snowe-Reid amendment to the Federal Health Benefits Plan seeking to extend federal health care coverage to include contraceptives. The nominee cosponsored unsuccessful congressional legislation seeking to impose upon all Americans a congressional finding that life begins at conception, which would have eliminated the availability of many common forms of contraception and legislation requiring parental consent for minors to receive contraception.\nThroughout his political career and at every opportunity, the nominee has sought to limit access to and require parental consent for not only abortion, but for contraception, as well. Although parental consent has never been suggested as prerequisite for a minor to engage in sexual intercourse or to bear children.\nAlthough the nominee has continually sought to give the decisional rights of a minor to her parents, he has never suggested that these same parents have any financial or other responsibility for the minor's child once born.\nThe nominee's involvement with Bob Jones University, with the nominations of Dr. Henry Foster and of Dr. David Satcher as surgeon general, the nomination of Ronnie White as federal district court judge; his tireless opposition to court-ordered desegregation plans; his support of school vouchers and of school prayer--all portray a person of deep, personal convictions, an admirable quality in other context. But when these convictions are historically at odds with existing law and public sentiment in this country, then a person with such convictions should not be asked to ignore them in an effort to carry out faithfully the oath of office, nor should we ever place any nominee in such an untenable dilemma.\nIn conclusion, I implore you to send a message to our president-elect to submit to this committee a nominee for attorney general in whom an overwhelming majority of our citizens can admire, take comfort and have confidence in to administer the office of attorney general in a fair and just manner for all Americans rather than an individual who has devoted his political career opposing the laws of this land on a wide variety of issues affecting the every day lives and the will of the people. Thank you.\nLEAHY: Ms. Michelman, we welcome you to this committee. You have been a witness here before and we appreciate having you here today.\nMICHELMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, and members of the committee. I appreciate the invitation to testify.\nA decade ago, I spoke here of my experience as a struggling young mother of three again pregnant by the husband who had abandoned my daughters and me, as a woman forced to endure humiliating interrogation by a hospital committee, confronted with laws that made abortion a crime. Since then, I have met thousands and thousands of women who depend on this nation's right to choose and the survivors of those women who died because they did not have that right.\nI have also spoken to women facing legal hurdles today. Desperate women call NARAL to ask whether the laws that restrict and stigmatize abortion forbid them from obtaining the services they need, women without the money to diaper their children, women who cannot travel for hours to get an abortion, young women who fear they will be battered if they tell their parents they are pregnant.\nThe right to safe, legal abortion hangs by a slender thread. That thread could be cut by just one Supreme Court justice or by an attorney general not committed to its protection. The women NARAL represents all across this country cannot afford to have that thread severed.\nI will discuss our opposition to this nomination in the context of three dominant themes. First, senators must choose between John Ashcroft's unmitigated quarter century attack on a woman's right to choose and his promise to this committee to preserve Roe v. Wade, the basis of the right he has long sought to undermine.\nSecond, this nomination is so far outside the bounds of our national consensus regarding fundamental civil rights that it must be rejected, notwithstanding the president's prerogatives and senatorial courtesy.\nAnd third, John Ashcroft's record speaks volumes. It shows that he would use the vast powers of the Department of Justice to bend the law and undermine the very freedoms it took American women a century to secure. His promise to enforce existing law is obvious and necessary, but is woefully insufficient.\nJohn Ashcroft's record includes the following--and I will note some of those that have already been mentioned. He cosponsored the Human Life Act, which would have virtually outlawed all abortions and common contraceptive methods like birth control pills. In his support for banning abortion procedures, he has called preserving the woman's life rhetorical nonsense. As attorney general, he tried to stop nurses from providing contraceptive services, an effort the state supreme court unanimously rejected.\nAs governor, he supported a bill outlawing abortion for 18 different reasons, almost all abortions. And women would have had to have signed an affidavit revealing the most intimate details of their personal lives. As attorney general, Ashcroft testified in favor of federal legislation declaring that life begins at conception, which would have allowed states to prosecute abortion as murder. Throughout his career, Ashcroft has worked to undermine, not respect, existing law.\nSenator Ashcroft's goal has been to criminalize abortion, even in the cases of incest and rape, and to limit the availability of contraceptives. He has used every single tool of public office to attack women's reproductive rights. Merely committing not to roll back our constitutional freedoms is not enough. To be confirmed, his record and his goals should be consistent with this commitment.\nSenator Ashcroft's convenient conversion on the road to confirmation is simply implausible. His conversion has been timely, but it will be too late for millions of American women if he does not live up to his surprising promise to protect their right to choose.\nNow, I know that when a colleague sits before you the confirmation process is particularly sensitive. And within reasonable bounds, a president indeed should be able to pick his closet advisers. But those bounds have been exceeded here. It would be unthinkable to confirm an attorney general who built a career on dismantling Brown v. Board of Education. By the same standard--by the very same standard--a person should be disqualified if he has sought over decades and by repeated official acts to annul the rights of women. A career built on attempts to repeal established constitutional rights is not only sufficient reason to vote against John Ashcroft's nomination, it should compel rejection.\nJohn Ashcroft has told you that he will enforce the law. I did not expect him to say anything different. Remember, though, the duties of the attorney general are far greater. He will advise the president on legal initiatives, he will be charged with interpreting the law, he will be a strong voice in the appointment of every United States attorney and federal judge, the solicitor general will work under his discretion. And I believe that Senator Ashcroft will have a very keen eye for the opportunities new cases and new statutes present.\nMay I say that NARAL expected the president to nominate a conservative, but John Ashcroft's record is indeed uncompromising. Millions of women who stand with me cannot afford the risk of your giving John Ashcroft the awesome powers of the attorney general.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Michelman.\nAnd, Ms. Feldt? As one not unaccustomed to testifying before the Congress, good to have you here.\nFELDT: Thank you very much, Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch and all senators.\nI am really honored to be here, particularly to follow upon the testimony of Ronnie White, I must say, very relevant to what we're talking about now.\nI also have a little confession to make. Yesterday Mr. Ashcroft disclosed to you that he and I, as I was the one who had talked with him about armadillos and skunks--the real point of that exchange, however, was to say that I agree with him that it is very important to act upon your convictions. And he and I have both spent over 25 years of our lives acting upon our convictions. But can you just wash away 25 years of passionate activism? I know I certainly could not.\nI want to believe Mr. Ashcroft when he says he accepts Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. But his career stands in sharp contrast to his statements this week. Since past behavior is the best predictor of future performance, I am very worried.\nJohn Ashcroft's beliefs are his own private business, but what he does about his beliefs are everybody's business. His career in government is noteworthy for his crusade to enact into law his belief that personhood begins at fertilization. This belief defies medical science.\nAs a U.S. senator, you know that he sponsored the most extreme version of the anti-choice human life amendment, which would have written his belief into the Constitution.\nAs governor of Missouri, he signed the legislation declaring his belief to be the policy of the state.\nAnd he opposed contraceptive coverage for federal employees because some of the contraceptives would have acted or could have acted after fertilization. Indeed, he never voted to support family planning at all.\nThe fundamental right to choose declared in Roe stands on the earlier Griswald v. Connecticut decision which protected the right to contraception. Both are based on the fundamental human and civil right to privacy in making childbearing decisions.\nMr. Ashcroft's crusade would not only outlaw abortion but most common methods of contraception as well. And unless Mr. Ashcroft is prepared to walk away from the keystone of his entire political career, then as attorney general he would be in a unique position to impose his definition of personhood as fertilization. This could not only strike at the right to abortion but also contraception.\nAn anti-choice president, plus John Ashcroft, plus a Supreme Court they helped shape, equals a recipe for disaster.\nYou have asked whether Mr. Ashcroft would enforce the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. He says that he will enforce the law, and that is necessary, but not sufficient. It takes leadership and prevention.\nAnd here's the difference: In the late '80s, hoards of demonstrators repeatedly stepped over the lines of legal protest at our centers. I personally received a long series of telephone death threats, both at home and at work. Our doctors were stopped day and night. Our health centers received numerous bomb threats. I went to the chief of police, and he said, \"Close the clinic.\" There was a sea change after FACE, and with an attorney general committed to vigorous enforcement.\nIt's not just about enforcing the law after violence has occurred, you see, because all around the country, U.S. attorneys brought together various law enforcement agencies. Collaboration and cooperation became expectations. U.S. marshals not only answered our phone calls, they started calling us to ask if they could help with preventive measures. Murders and violent acts nationwide were cut in half as a result.\nPaula Geanino (ph), CEO of our St. Louis Planned Parenthood affiliate, tells me that in John Ashcroft's tenure as the attorney general and the governor of Missouri, he did not once take a public leadership stand against clinic violence. Her staff could not find in the media nor any individual who remembers Mr. Ashcroft speaking out on clinic violence, even when Reproductive Health Services was firebombed, causing $100,000 worth of damage in 1986.\nSenator Ashcroft has said that he's proud Missouri brought more anti-abortion cases to the Supreme Court than any state. He's said that outlawing abortion is more important to him than cutting taxes, and that if he could only pass one law, it would be to outlaw abortion. How can he turn that spigot off? And if he can, what does that say?\nI want to close by talking to you not as senators, but as men and women--none of the women are here today, I'm sorry to say--who care deeply about the nation and its people. This nomination represents something bigger than presidential discretion, bigger than senatorial courtesy, bigger even than your personal friendships. This is about a fundamental human and civil right to determine whether you believe women have the moral authority to run their own lives, to make their own childbearing decisions.\nSo I ask you to listen to your inner voices and think about what you will say to your daughters and your granddaughters. How will you explain to future generations if John Ashcroft uses the power of his office to deny the women you know and love reproductive choices, the right to our own lives?\nThank you very much.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Ms. Feldt.\nMs. Greenberger, good to have you here again. And please go ahead. And we're having some difficulties with some of the sound system, so bring the microphone close to you.\nGREENBERGER: Thank you.\nThank you, Senator Leahy, and other members of this committee for the invitation to testify today. I'm co-president of the National Women's Law Center, which since 1972 has been in the forefront of virtually every major effort to secure women's legal rights. My testimony today is presented on behalf of the center as well as the National Partnership for Women and Families, which since its founding in 1971 as the Women's Legal Defense Fund has also been a preeminent advocate for women's legal rights in Washington and nationally.\nAnd we're here today to oppose the nomination of John Ashcroft to serve as attorney general of the United States, and we do so because the attorney general of the United States, very simply, is responsible for protecting and enforcing the fundamental principles and laws that have advanced and safeguarded women's progress for more than three decades, and because, as has been stated here, Senator Ashcroft's record demonstrates that entrusting him with this heavy responsibility would put these precious gains for women at far too great a risk to ask them to bear.\nMr. Ashcroft has testified that he would accept responsibility to execute the laws as they are and not as he might wish them to be, but we have not been reassured by his testimony. The extreme positions that have been a driving and overriding theme of his long public career have repeatedly led him to misread what the laws are and then to zealously use his public offices to advance his mistaken views. His assurances in his testimony were too often general in nature, subject to many caveats, and must be considered within the context of the way in which he did discharge his obligations when he was also obligated to enforce and also interpret the laws.\nI want to mention briefly some of the areas beyond choice and abortion and contraception, so important, and what has been discussed so far this morning, to raise some other issues as well.\nWe have heard about his opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have given women the highest legal protection against sex discrimination in all areas of life by the government. This stands in stark contrast to his support of other amendments to the Constitution, extraordinary support to so many other amendments.\nAnd we know about his vigorous pursuit of the National Organization for Women. And we know of only one other attorney general who even mentions support of that kind of suit, out of the 15 states that were subject to boycott at that time.\nHe used his veto power not just in not supporting laws important to women, but actually vetoing laws, including a maternity leave law in 1980 that he vetoed that was far more limited in scope than the federal Family Medical and Leave Act that he would be charged with upholding, including enforcing as attorney general.\nHe twice vetoed bills that would have established a state minimum wage in Missouri. Women are the majority of minimum-wage earners. And at that time Missouri was only one of six states without a state minimum wage law.\nHe twice used his line-item veto, in 1991 and again the following year, to seek out and strike even small sums of money for domestic violence programs, prompting a local domestic violence advocate to denounce the action as reprehensible in light of the fact that the programs in question were literally struggling to stay afloat.\nOne of the most critical responsibilities of an AG in administering the Department of Justice program dealing with violence against women is determining the financial resources that will be committed to that very program.\nAs a senator, Mr. Ashcroft's record on issues important to women has been no better, and my written testimony explains why. I will mention two points briefly.\nFirst, as senator, he repeatedly blocked the confirmation of highly qualified women to the federal bench.\nNot one of us sitting here today could have failed but be moved by the extraordinary testimony of Judge Ronnie White. And I want to point out how struck I was by the important notes of criticism that were articulated by members of this committee about the process that was followed in the Judge Ronnie White case.\nThere have been similar problems with other women nominees.\nSenator Specter, you identified those problems this morning. Senator Ashcroft would be screening and evaluating judges and major responsibility. He would be responsible for setting up and implementing the process he would use to screen and refer judges to the president. He would be doing this behind closed doors.\nThis Senate has seen how he has operated in the open. To give him that vast authority, as I say, behind closed doors, is unthinkable.\nI want to also say that his promise to enforce the law as it is has not been borne out in practice when he has disagreed with the law as it has been. He has not been able to do so. And I am not questioning his motives or the conviction with which he made the promise to this committee and to the American public. What I am questioning is his ability to dispassionately, despite his intentions to do so otherwise, but his ability to actually read the law fairly and accurately.\nWe've heard about what happened with the nurse's case. I want to briefly mention one other case when he was attorney general of Missouri, where he supported, in court, trying to go all the way up to the Supreme Court, a law that would have automatically terminated parental rights to a child born after an attempted abortion, and then making automatically the child a ward of the state.\nJudge William Webster, then a judge on the 8th Circuit, described the provision, and these are in his words in a concurring opinion, as offensive, totally lacking in due process and patently unconstitutional.\nWe cannot ask the American public to rely upon the promises of Senator Ashcroft that his view of what is constitutional will become the view that then is argued to the Supreme Court, is the subject of advice for discrimination laws across the country...\nLEAHY: Thank you, Ms. Greenberger.\nGREENBERGER: ... and the like. Thank you.\nLEAHY: Ms. Campbell, as always, it's good to have you here. Please go ahead with your testimony.\nCOLLEEN CAMPBELL: Thank you.\nHonorable Senators, I'm going to declare this is a tough one for me, but I'm going to get through it.\nMy only son is dead. He's been murdered because of a flawed justice system; a weak system allowed the release of a lifer from prison. After the inmate was given another chance, that one more chance and that opportunity was given to kill my son.\nWe need an attorney general who will strongly uphold the intent of the law and our Constitution and help protect the people from crime.\nMy name is Colleen Thompson Campbell. Just last month, I completed my second term was mayor in the beautiful city of San Juan Capistrano in California. I'm a former chairman of POST, that's the Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission. I also serve on the California Commission on Criminal Justice. I did not buy into ever being a victim of crime.\nToday I've been asked to represent and speak for many people, including my friend and great crime-fighter, John Walsh of \"America's Most Wanted.\" He badly wanted to be here today.\nI've been requested to represent and speak on behalf of 12 major California crime victims organizations and the hundreds of thousands of crime victims that those organizations represent. We strongly and unequivocally support the confirmation of John Ashcroft as the next attorney general of the United States of America. Throughout his long career, he has shown great heart and he has worked hard to lessen the devastation which victims are forced to endure.\nMy own journey into hell began with the murder of our only son, Scott (ph).\nBecause we were only the mom and dad, we had no rights. We were forced to sit outside the courtroom on a bench in the hall, like dogs with fleas. And during the seven years encompassing the three trials of our son's murderers, that's where we sat. We were excluded, while the defendants' families were allowed to be inside and follow the trial and give support to the killers.\nThe murder of our son was brutal, and our treatment at the hands of the justice system was inhumane, cruel and barbaric. Nothing in our life had prepared us for such injustice.\nLong ago, John Ashcroft realized the need for balanced justice and has worked toward that end. He understands the victims in our country must no longer suffer the indignities that many have been forced to endure.\nJohn Ashcroft stands for fairness, law, order and justice. He stands for balancing the rights of the accused with the rights of the victims and the law-abiding. He stands for constitutional rights for crime victims.\nThroughout this great country we need unselfish courage. We need John Ashcroft's strong conviction in the right against crime. And we need him to further victims' rights.\nVictims, God bless them, deserve notice, just like the criminal, the bright to be present and the right to be heard at critical stages of their case. They deserve respect and concern for their safety. They deserve a speedy trial every bit as much as the defendant. Victims deserve at the very least equal rights to the criminal.\nMy only sibling, my brother Mickey Thompson (ph), and his wife were also murdered. This case is being actively pursued, and I have great faith that this case will soon be brought to trial. I only hope that our family can endure the justice system again.\nJohn Ashcroft will fight for legal rights and true remedies for crime victims. We urge you to support John Ashcroft's confirmation.\nNo one knows who's going to be a victim, and if you will permit me, my words today are dedicated to the memory of Brian (ph) Campbell, my 17-year-old grandson, who died nine days ago. And it's really tough to be here, and if this wasn't so darn important I wouldn't be here. But together, Brian (ph) and I believed, as long as we have courage, today will be beautiful; as long as we have memories, yesterday will remain; as long as we have purpose, tomorrow will improve.\nThank you, Senators, for allowing me to speak. And I'm sorry I choke up.\nLEAHY: Ms. Campbell, you have no need to apologize for being choked up. A former senator and mentor of mine when I came here said a person who has no tears has no heart.\nCAMPBELL: Thank you.\nLEAHY: And so...\nCAMPBELL: They must think I have a lot of tears, they got me the whole box. Thank you for saying that.\nLEAHY: Well, those of us who have been prosecutors have some sense of what victims go through, and it is a terrible thing. I don't think anybody who hasn't either been a victim or been intimately involved with the criminal justice system knows (inaudible) the victims get victimized over and over and over again.\nAt the request of Senator Hatch, and then following the normal courtesy, he's advised me that Congressman Watts and Congressman Hulshof--I know Congressman Hulshof is here, because I spoke to him earlier--are here.\nThis was the panel that was going to be on last night and because of some miscommunication, some members were able to be here and some weren't. And now, because of further miscommunication, the last member of that panel is not here.\nBut following the normal tradition in the Congress of putting members of Congress on if they're available, I'm going to ask the panel here to step down, rejoin us after lunch and we'll go back to your questions. And we'll call Congressman Watts and Congressman Hulshof now. As Congressman Clyburn gets back, we'll have him. But we will go back to questions after lunch.\nMs. Greenberger, Ms. Feldt, Ms. Michelman, Mr. Susman, Mr. Hunter, Ms. Woods and Mr. Robertson, thank you.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: If we could have order in the committee room so we make it possible for the witnesses to be heard. We have a very large room here and I know there are some people who are leaving and some people are coming in, and there are two distinguished members of the House of Representatives who deserve to be heard.\nWe'll hear first from Congressman Watts, who is a member of the Republican leadership, majority leadership in the House of Representatives.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I received a letter from Congressman Hulshof. While I did not agree to his basic request, I think I misunderstood the tone of the request. I state that not only for the congressman, but for any member of his family who may be watching, that in 26 years here, I have tried, I believe I have a reputation of always trying to extend whatever courtesy is possible to all members of both the House and the Senate of either party.\nCongressman Watts, I have said we will begin with you as a member of the Republican leadership.\nWATTS: Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Hatch, senators of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for affording me the opportunity to address the nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be the next attorney general of the United States.\nLet me say here at the outset that as I have observed these hearings from time to time over the last two and a half days, that any man or woman, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, who would sit through this process for three days and have bombs thrown at him should be confirmed for whatever.\nAnd, Mr. Chairman, John Ashcroft is a man of the highest integrity. I have worked with him over the last five and a half years in the Renewal Alliance, putting together legislation targeting poor and under-served communities, for home ownership, savings, job creation and capital formation. And, by the way, President Clinton signed that legislation into law about a month and a half ago, the most comprehensive piece of poverty legislation ever to go through the House and the Senate.\nI've campaigned with Senator Ashcroft in St. Louis. I've known him for the past six years. And I have never known Senator Ashcroft to be a racist nor have I ever detected anything but dignity and respect for one's skin color from John Ashcroft.\nHe is a man of principle. He has been scrupulously put through an inquisition of mammoth proportion, and it is safe to say that this committee has looked into everything dealing with the career and character of John Ashcroft.\nWe all know that no one is going to believe all of you all the time, but John Ashcroft takes defending and upholding the law seriously, and I believe that's what matters the most.\nThe responsibility of the attorney general is to defend and uphold the law, not to make the law. It is the responsibility of us, the Congress of the United States, to make the law.\nAs I said earlier, I have watched bits and pieces of these hearings during the last two and a half days. I haven't watched them all. Believe it or not, Little League soccer and junior varsity basketball games continue in spite of these very important hearings.\nThere's not a lot I can say today that hasn't already been said during these proceedings.\nHowever, I will say I am delighted that outside groups aren't making the determination on Senator Ashcroft.\nI heard Senator Biden say yesterday afternoon that he did not trust many of the interest groups that have gotten involved. And if Senator Biden was here today, I would say to him, I agree with you, neither do I. I've been blind-sided by them before. And so many of these groups totally disregard the facts. Not only do they want their own opinion, they want their own facts. So again, if Senator Biden was here, I would say to him that I can relate to what he was talking about yesterday.\nI'm delighted that people who know Senator Ashcroft best will make the call on his confirmation. And in your deliberations, I would ask you to consider his qualities, his qualifications, and his integrity.\nLast Monday, on January 15, after observing Dr. King's birthday, my 11 year-old daughter and I were watching a Disney movie, \"The Fox and the Hound.\" And I watched the movie for about an hour and then the movie watched me as I went to sleep on it. However, I've seen it 23 times. And it's must-see viewing for everybody.\nThe story is, Copper the hound puppy and Todd, the orphan fox, they became the best of friends. They did everything together. They laughed and they played together to no end. Then one day, Copper the hound and Todd the fox found themselves all grown up. Todd wanted to get together with Copper to have some more fun and relive the good old days. And Copper's heart seemed to skip a bit when he had to say to Todd, I can't play with you any more, I'm a hunting dog now. In other words, I can't be your friend anymore, forget we were the best of friends, forget we laughed together and played together, forget all those great times together, and all those other things, forget about all of that, I'm a hunting dog now.\nWell, I notice that any time we have a confirmation, the hunting dogs come out. We have them on the Republican side, we have them on the Democrat side.\nMembers of the committee, I'm not saying that John Ashcroft has been best of friends with all of you. However, over the last six years, you've seen his heart, you know him. You've observed him up close and personal. You know he's not a racist, as some would suggest. You know he's not anti-woman, as some would suggest. Yes, you know that just like Senator Lieberman, John Ashcroft's faith is very important to him. They both never want their faith to be offensive to anyone, yet they never apologize for it.\nYou have observed Senator Ashcroft to be a man of compassion, strength, and integrity. He is extremely qualified. He is eminently qualified to be the next attorney general of the greatest nation in all the world.\nObviously, this decision will rest with you, the senators. But I encourage your support for Senator John Ashcroft as the next attorney general to uphold the laws and the Constitution of the United States, so help him, God.\nThank you, very much, Chairman Leahy.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Watts.\nI state parenthetically that I'm 60 years old, and that's quite a bit older than you are. Our children came along before we had the VCRs as youngsters. By the time we had it, they were old enough they didn't want me around to see what they were watching. So I didn't have the chance to memorize these. I now have a soon-to-be 3-year-old grandson. If you'd like me to tell you the whole script of \"Thomas The Train,\" every song, I can do it, in my sleep, and often have.\nCongressman?\nHULSHOF: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I appreciate very much the invitation to be here. As you alluded to just a moment ago, I'm sure my dear mother back in Missouri appreciates your kind words today, especially in light of the little brouhaha that occurred last night. I do appreciate the chance to be with you.\nLEAHY: I assure your mother that you are one of the hardest working and most valued members of the Congress.\nHULSHOF: I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. That's high praise.\nMembers of the committee, as pleased and honored as I am to be here today with my good friend and colleague J. C. Watts, my appearance here today is not as a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives.\nMr. Chairman, if it is permissible, I would like to have my entire written statement submitted into the record so that I could perhaps address some of the points that have come before this committee in the last two days.\nLEAHY: It will be.\nHULSHOF: I sat through and listened very closely to Judge White's testimony today, and I found it very compelling and very sincere--no less compelling and no less sincere than the testimony that you heard from your former colleague, I believe, John Ashcroft over the last two days.\nI do not know Judge White personally; I know him from the pages of the opinions that he has written. I presume that he knows me through the many thousands of pages of court transcripts that I had the occasion to participate in in criminal trials back in Missouri. And I'm not here in any respect to cast dispersions. I'm a member of good-standing in the Missouri Bar, and I'm very watchful of my comments toward a sitting member of the judiciary.\nHowever, as the co-prosecutor in the James Johnson case, which has received such national attention--and I think it's received national attention not because of the gruesomeness of the facts of a convicted multiple cop-killer, but because, as my friend J.C. has alluded to, these horrendous charges that John Ashcroft's vote against Judge White was based on other than legal grounds. These comments or insinuations, even overtly or not so overtly of racial motivations have me, as John's friend and as a Missourian, deeply troubled.\nAnd so, let me, if I can, as a fact witness, talk a little bit about this particular criminal case. I was a special prosecutor for the Missouri attorney general for a number of years and was assigned to assist the locally elected prosecuting authority, John Kay (ph) in Moniteau County, back when these crimes occurred in 1991.\nMr. Chairman, you all have talked at length about those facts. And I set them out in my written statement, but I want to just focus on some things, perhaps, to give you a sense of gravity about what this case meant to this small, rural community.\nIn early December of 1991, Moniteau County Deputy Leslie Roark (ph) was dispatched to a disturbance call in rural Moniteau County. And as any one in law enforcement can tell you, those are some of those difficult cases to respond to, because you never know the situation that you are being injected to.\nWell, after Deputy Roark (ph) assured himself that this domestic quarrel had ended at the James Johnson residence, and as he turned to retreat to go to his waiting patrol car, James Johnson whipped out a 38-caliber pistol from the waistband of his pants and fired two shots into the back of the retreating officer.\nJohnson then went back into the home, sat down, but where he could hear the moans of the officer clinging valiantly to life, laying face down on the gravel driveway outside his home. At that point, Johnson then got up from the table, walked outside, pointed his gun over the fallen officer and pulled the trigger one last time in an executive-style killing.\nAnd the thing about this particular crime that is particularly offensive is that, as they say in the law enforcement business: The officer, though armed, never cleared leather. His gun remained strapped in his holster.\nShortly after that, James Johnson got into his vehicle and negotiated 10 or 12 miles of winding road, looking for the sheriff of the county, Kenny Jones. He knew where the sheriff lived. And as luck would have it, Sheriff Jones was not at the residence. But the sheriff's wife, Pam, was.\nAnd again, as fate would have it on that night, Mrs. Jones was leading a group of her church friends in the Christmas program. And if I can try to, Mr. Chairman, paint a visual picture for you, imagine a normal living room, somewhere in America, with a women seated at the head and women unfolding chairs around her in the living room. With Pam Jones 8-year-old daughter, Lacy (ph), at her knee. Christmas decorations adorned the living room and on a table next to the window, brightly wrapped Christmas packages waiting to be exchanged.\nWhat you cannot see in that picture, however, just outside that window, James Johnson lay and wait with a 22-caliber rifle. And from his perch shot five times inside the house, killing, gunning down Pam Jones in cold blood in front of her family.\nIf the chairman would permit, he is not here to testify today, but if I might be permitted to single out Pam Jones' husband who made the trip here today, sheriff of Moniteau County, Kenny Jones. And may I ask him to stand, Mr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: Of course.\nHULSHOF: There's a statement that Sheriff Jones has submitted and, perhaps, if time permits at the conclusion, there are a couple of excerpts that I might like to emphasize, but please, I hope you would take time to examine the entirety of Sheriff Jones' written testimony, particularly as it points to the dispute about this letter from law enforcement and who was the initiating body, in that regard. And I'll move in the interests of time.\nLEAHY: Direct the staff to make copies for each senator and make sure a copy is given to each member of the panel.\nHULSHOF: Mr. Chairman, again, without further delving into the facts, because I think, as most of you have indicated through these days, that you have read the supreme court opinion where Judge White dissented. It was the sole dissent.\nBut what I do want to focus on is the record regarding assistance of counsel, because apparently, as I listened to Judge White this morning, that was his sole basis for voting to overturn and reverse these four death sentences for these four crimes. There actually were two other victims who had fallen victim to Mr. Johnson that night, and a fifth officer who was wounded seriously who miraculously survived. The jury in that county found four counts of first degree murder, with a corresponding death sentence on each of those counts of murder.\nThe points I'd like to raise briefly about the quality of James Johnson's representation is this: He hired counsel of his own choosing. He picked from our area in mid-Missouri what we've referred to as--as I referred to as a dream team.\nAnd Senator Sessions, as you pointed out earlier, the resumes of these three individuals, who were experienced attorneys in litigation, as well as criminal law, attorneys who had tried a capital murder case together, there was a finding by another court that they provide highly skilled representation as they tried to deal with these very unassailable facts, this very strong case that the prosecution had. There was a detailed confession Mr. Johnson had given to local law enforcement officers. There were other incriminating statements that he had made to lay witnesses. We had circumstantial evidence, including firearms identification, a host of other factors. And against this backdrop of a very tough prosecution case, these three defense attorneys labored mightily to try to provide an insanity defense, post-traumatic stress disorder, commonly referred to as the Vietnam flashback syndrome.\nAnd without question--and again, perhaps with just a further comment--I defended a capital murder case as a court-appointed public defender. And then after I switched sides and became, as you, Mr. Chairman, on the side of law enforcement, became a prosecuting attorney, over the course of my career I think I prosecuted some 16 capital murder cases in Missouri, and I can tell you without question that this team of defense attorneys were very able and provided very skilled, adequate representation as the law would require.\nFinally, regarding the point, and I know the chairman's been gracious with my time, what I would like to do is read just a couple of the excerpts, as Sheriff Jones is here and will not be called as a witness, but particularly again on this point of the letter from law enforcement authorities.\nSays Sheriff Jones (ph): \"As you know, much has been said about John Ashcroft and his fitness for this office. I, for one, support his nomination and urge this committee to support him as well.\n\"Last year, Senator Ashcroft was unjustly labeled for his opposition to the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to the federal district court. This one event has wrongly called into question his honor and integrity.\n\"Be assured that Senator Ashcroft had no other reason that I know about to oppose Judge White except that I asked him to. I opposed Judge White's nomination to the federal bench, and I asked Senator Ashcroft to join me because of Judge White's opinion on a death penalty case.\"\nMoving to page three, again, Sheriff Jones, \"In his opinion, Judge White urged that Johnson be given a second chance at freedom. I cannot understand his reasoning. I know that the four people Johnson killed were not given a second chance.\n\"When I learned that Judge White was picked by President Clinton to sit on the federal bench, I was outraged,\" says Sheriff Jones. \"Because of Judge White's dissenting opinion on the Johnson case, I felt he was unsuitable to be appointed for life to such an important and powerful position. During the Missouri Sheriffs' Association annual conference in 1999, I started a petition drive among the sheriffs to oppose the nomination. The petition simply requested that consideration be given to Judge White's dissenting opinion in the Johnson case as a factor in his appointment to the federal bench. Seventy-seven Missouri sheriffs, both Democrats and Republicans, signed the petition, and it was available to anyone who asked.\n\"Further, I asked,\" said Sheriff Jones, \"I also asked that the National Sheriffs' Association support us in opposing Judge White's nomination. They willingly did so. And I'm grateful that they joined us and wrote a strong letter opposing Judge White's nomination.\"\nAnd with that, I appreciate the deference of the chairman. I would be happy to answer questions about this case or others.\nLEAHY: I thank you and thank both members. And I do appreciate Sheriff Jones being here. I repeat part of what I said on the Senate floor about Sheriff Jones on October 21, 1999. I said, \"I certainly understand and appreciate Sheriff Kenny Jones deciding to write the fellow sheriffs about this nomination. Sheriff Jones' wife was killed in the brutal rampage of James Johnson. And all senators give their respect and sympathy to Sheriff Jones and his family.\"\nThe day of the debate, the one we all agreed upon, Sheriff, was how horrified we were at what happened and the sympathy we have. Like a number of others in the Senate, I have prosecuted a number of murder cases--for eight years, I tried virtually all the murder cases--tried, personally--that came within our jurisdiction.\nSome of them are horrific, others were an example, as anyone in law enforce knows, but we call and use that terrible expression, \"the friendly murder\"; the family dispute that gets out of hand. All tragic. All horrible.\nThe description of this murder is the most horrible one I've ever heard of. That's not a question that--nobody disputes the horrible and terrible nature of this murder. Nobody disputes the right in the state of Missouri to impose whatever penalty they have on the books, whether somebody's for or against the death penalty, if it's on the books. Nobody disputes their right to do that. And everybody ascribes to the right of a fair trial.\nThe question, of course, comes in this--not whether Justice White was saying this person should be freed. As he stated here today, that's not what his ruling was. His ruling was to remand--he was a dissent of that to remand for a new trial.\nBut Congressman, you've been, as you said yourself, the prosecutor and public defender. Before I was a prosecutor, I depended only upon the assigned counsel basis. We didn't start a public defender until probably through my prosecutor's career. Frankly, I found it easier being the prosecutor. But you had to help defend a person who's accused of murder, and I would assume that as that defense attorney, you zealously worked to acquit him; would that be right? I mean, that's what you'd be required to do.\nHULSHOF: Zealously defend the man accused to the best of my ability and certainly a lesser offense or to spare the death penalty and, I think, as any defense attorney is charged to do.\nLEAHY: The question of penalty, and I assume with that you would argue, of course, that even though he has been convicted of murder, you would then argue that he not get the death penalty?\nHULSHOF: That's correct, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: And actually, in the canons of ethics, once having accepted that assignment, you have to do that, do you not?\nHULSHOF: That is correct.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nIt is also the requirements on the prosecutor, certain requirements there. In the Johnson case, the Missouri Supreme Court had raised questions about the suggestive silence at a deposition, failure to correct misstatements during a deposition. The majority decision, now this is a majority that upheld Johnson's conviction and death penalty, said quote, \"This court does not condone the conduct of the state in failing to correct the erroneous implication from its own confusion about the perimeter defense,\" close quote.\nYou have both a defense attorney and a prosecutor. Both are expected to do their best to win their cases. Is that a fair statement?\nHULSHOF: It is, Mr. Chairman, with some qualification, and I'll be happy to state this.\nLEAHY: Go ahead.\nHULSHOF: Well, clearly, the challenge for any defense attorney is to aggressively, zealously, within the bounds of law and the canons of ethics, defend the client. The prosecutor's role is even a bit greater than that. Not to be simply out to win the case, but to be, I think as the canons say, a minister of justice.\nLEAHY: You presuppose my next question then. In this case, the Johnson opinion, if I am correct, was critical of the state, as they said, in failing to correct the erroneous implication from its own confusion about the perimeter evidence. Is that correct?\nHULSHOF: I'm no sure of the exact--I've got the opinions, but I'd love to be able to explain since I've never had the opportunity to talk about...\nLEAHY: Go ahead.\nHULSHOF: And perhaps, just to set the record here, the perimeter evidence, as you might expect when the hue and cry went out to law enforcement that there had been this crime spree, this rampage over a period of time, roughly between 7:30 in the evening until 1:20 the next morning, hundreds--in fact, as we learned later, probably over 100 officers responded and participated in this manhunt. The defendant, James Johnson, actually concealed himself in the home of an 82-year-old woman.\nLEAHY: The call of officer down galvanizes all law enforcement. I've been there, I know what it's like.\nHULSHOF: Absolutely, absolutely.\nAnd at some point, after Mr. Johnson had been taken into custody, and the tedious process of the collection of evidence began, it was determined there was this crude alarm system, as the court calls the perimeter evidence of a rope with some tin cans. And inside those tin cans, pieces of gravel, so that if a person were to trip it, that you would hear this noise. It was collected by the officers, but there was no report as to who had collected it, who had put it there. There was also some evidence that the vehicle that Mr. Johnson had abandoned had four flat tires and no one was quite sure--at least, there were no police reports indicating who had flattened those tires. And so really, it was not a relevant trail for the prosecution to go down.\nAnd we did not know, Mr. Chairman, as we walked into court on the day that the trial began, who had set the perimeter evidence, who had disabled the car. And quite frankly, as our theory of the case was focusing on these nationally renowned mental experts that the defense had hired to bring in on post-traumatic stress disorder, that we were clearly focusing on other matters thinking this perimeter evidence to be curiosity.\nLEAHY: OK.\nThe testimony here has been that, in 95 percent of the death penalty cases in which Judge White participated, he voted with at least one and usually more of the judges appointed by the then-Governor Ashcroft. Would that be fair to characterize that record as pro-criminal or bend toward criminal activity?\nHULSHOF: Judge--excuse me, Mr. Chairman. I've already put you on the federal bench.\nLEAHY: I only get the chairmanship for a few days, so I'll take the bench, if you want to throw that in while we're at it, go ahead.\nHULSHOF: Again, I want to be very cautious, as far as my response of articulating a position on Judge Ronnie White. But what I am here to say is that, as you all have debated and as I've watched with fascination, Senator Ashcroft was here telling the Senate, as he did on the Senate floor to his colleagues, that it wasn't for any other reason--certainly not for racial reasons, as we've heard--that led to his decision to vote against the confirmation of Judge Ronnie White.\nAnd it wasn't even this one single case, Mr. Chairman, you and I have been chatting about. It was, in John Ashcroft's mind, a pattern or series of cases.\nLEAHY: Well, then maybe I should ask you--and I don't think it's fair either to you or to Senator Ashcroft for you to go in his mind--but would you characterize Judge White's record as being either pro-criminal or having a bend toward criminal activity.\nHULSHOF: Again, I'm not ducking your question. As a member of good-standing in the Missouri bar, I want to be very cautious about making any statements about a judge. And, clearly, as a member of the other body who has no authority to vote to confirm or not to confirm any person that's nominated, I appreciate your question, Mr. Chairman, but I hesitate to make a personal assessment of Judge Ronnie White.\nLEAHY: I understand.\nSenator Hatch?\nHATCH: I want to thank both of you for coming. J.C., you're one of my heroes. And, frankly, everybody here knows what a fine man you are and what a good example you are to everybody. I appreciate your testimony here today and your support for Senator Ashcroft.\nMr. Hulshof, let me just say this: Sheriff Jones, we appreciate you being here today. We know how deeply you feel and your firsthand account of what happened and why you opposed Judge White will be made part of the record.\nAnd I also want to thank you for reminding us of an important point that I'm afraid some of us often overlook. That is, the decisions made by judgments in this country can have a profound impact on the lives of our local citizens and law enforcement personnel. And for that reason, we should listen carefully to the views people, like yourself, express.\nIn particular, Congressman Hulshof, I have a lot of admiration for you and for the life that you've lived and the work you've done as a prosecutor, as an attorney. You've been in the big time, as far as death penalty cases are concerned. And I think the knowledge you bring to Congress is very important. And, I, for one, will want to get even better acquainted than we are now. And I know it's not easy for you to testify here today, but it is important that you do.\nEarlier today, Congressman Hulshof, we heard testimony from Judge White. And I happen to be very impressed with Judge White; I was when I conducted the hearing. So my opinion of Judge White was a good one.\nBut let me just say this, there's room for two sides on this issue. I'm not going to condemn my Democratic colleagues for their very sincere vote for Judge White. Nor am I going to condemn my Republican colleagues for their very sincere vote against him. There were some pretty crass comments made at the time, but I think there's room here to go either way, as much as I like Judge White, and I do.\nWe heard testimony from Judge White earlier today that his dissent in the Johnson case was based on settled Supreme Court case law, as stated in the Strickland case.\nAre you familiar with that case?\nHULSHOF: Yes, sir, I am.\nHATCH: Now, you are an expert, experienced death penalty litigator, and an expert in case law. Would you be kind enough to explain, for the benefit of all of us here on the committee, the law and its relationship to effective assistance of counsel and how all of the other justices disagreed with Judge White's interpretation of the law in the Johnson case?\nI'd like you to explain what the law is and talk about that and exactly--I'd like you to explain, if you care to--what would have been the effect on law enforcement in Missouri and victims' rights. Some of the most compelling testimony we've had, testimony on this, has been on victims' rights. I appreciated that, but what would have been the effect on law enforcement of victims' rights if the Missouri Supreme Court had held in the Johnson case--and other cases, perhaps--the way Judge White would have liked the court to have decided in that case?\nI don't mean to put you on the spot, but I think that question has to be answered.\nHULSHOF: Senator, I appreciate your kind words, and I will attempt to answer the questions as you put them to me and do that as expeditiously as I can.\nI think it goes back to the senator from my neighboring state of Illinois, as I listened to a colloquy yesterday, about is--I think the question--forgive me for paraphrasing. I don't have your transcript, Senator Durbin, but is an error committed by a trial lawyer sufficient in and off itself--I am paraphrasing what you've said--but is an error committed by the criminal defense attorney in and off itself sufficient to overturn a sentence or a conviction.\nAnd the United States Supreme Court case law, which our state supreme court is deemed to follow, says it's not, that simply an error committed by defense counsel is insufficient because essentially there are errors committed in--whether death penalty cases or even in a felonious stealing case...\nHATCH: Was that the rule of law that should've been applied in this case?\nHULSHOF: It was not the rule of law that should've been applied. And I think that the majority opinion in the Johnson case adequately and accurately described what that standard is--is that: Is it, as a result of any error by a defendant's counsel, that created a reasonable likelihood or probability that the outcome of the case would have been different but for the error.\nAnd so I think, again, the majority opinion in the Johnson case correctly stated the law. I see the red light is on, and let me undertake...\nHATCH: You can continue to answer. I'll ask my colleague to just give me a few more minutes.\nLEAHY: Of course.\nHULSHOF: Let me, if I could, try to answer the second part of your question as for the effective law enforcement. And I really--to this distinguished panel--the numbers that have been talked about as far as the number of affirmations or the number of dissents, I really don't know. I've not done that research, and I'm sure that those numbers are accurate.\nBut it's a little bit--I think, it's troubling for me, again, as going back to my former days as someone who toiled in the courtrooms around our state. It's troubling to try to negotiate or talk about these terms as far as statistics. I think the further that I, personally, get away those days when I stood this far away from a box--a jury box--where 12 ordinary citizens were asked by the prosecution to do extraordinary things.\nI think the further I get away from that experience, perhaps the more I forget about how extremely difficult those cases are. They're physically demanding, emotionally draining--not just for the litigants but for the jurors that we put in those positions and for the defendant's family and certainly for the victim's family.\nAnd the point I hope to make, Senator Hatch, is that any time that there is a reversal or any time an esteemed jurist writes a dissent, it is--in a reversal case of a reversal, it is, at least, the opportunity that that convicted killer can be free.\nOr in the case of a dissent, it is a message to law enforcement, it's a message to victims like Sheriff Kenny Jones, that perhaps their sacrifice has been somewhat in vain. And so, clearly, again, I see that I'm probably teetering all in the line. This is not any comment on Judge White, per se, but I answer that question in the larger context to which you gave it.\nHATCH: Thank you very much.\nLEAHY: The senior senator from New York.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank both of our witnesses for taking their time in being here, and I also want to convey my respects and sadness to Sheriff Jones for his loss, as well as to Ms. Campbell for her loss. I'm sorry, we had another hearing, and I couldn't be here for your testimony or those of the others, on energy. As somebody who has been with families who have had losses in these horrible kinds of incidents, my heart goes out to both of you.\nI'd like to just focus a little bit, Representative Hulshof, in terms of this specific issue which troubles me, because the only thing, as I understand it, that Judge White did in this case was to say as a legal matter he believed that the defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to his insanity defense, and there's a debate about that, which we have heard.\nHULSHOF: Yes, sir.\nSCHUMER: And that's a fair debate. But in no way did Ronnie White condone these grizzly crimes. In fact, the first sentence of his opinion reads, \"I would find the result troubling.\" And at the end of his opinion he said, \"This is a very hard case.\" If Mr. Johnson was in control of his faculties when he went on this murderous rampage, then he assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given. That doesn't indicate somebody to me who is pro-criminal or, even on that instance, quote, \"soft on crime.\" I mean, I've been, in my state, one of the people who's pushed for tougher laws, whether it be capital punishment or ending parole or things like that.\nBut when somebody, a judge, or somebody else who's talking about a fair trial, I don't think fair trial ever enters into what side one is one. There is a balance between societal rights and individual rights, but all of us would agree both play a role.\nSo I would just like to ask, Representative Hulshof, would you say that any candidate to judge should be rejected because, as a legal matter, he'd written an opinion questioning the effectiveness of counsel? That's what I don't understand. I've come across people on the bench who I would characterize as soft on crime. I don't think a decision saying that there was ineffective counsel, whether it be right or wrong--that's not what we're debating here, in my judgment anyway--entitles you to say that somebody is pro-criminal or whatever the other expression that Senator Ashcroft used on the floor of the Senate. Could you comment on that?\nHULSHOF: I'd be happy to, Senator Schumer. Let me say, also, I appreciated the two years that we had to serve together in the United States House.\nLet me just even take a little further--Judge White's dissent went further and this is where--I can't speak for John Ashcroft, but as a prosecutor, here is the language that I find particularly troubling. It's the sentence just where you stopped.\n\"But the question of what,\" and I'm quoting from State v. Johnson at page 16, \"But the question of what Mr. Johnson's mental status was on the night is not susceptible of easy answers. While Mr. Johnson may not, as the jury found, have met the legal definition of insanity, whatever drove Mr. Johnson to go from being a law-abiding citizen to being a multiple killer was certainly something akin to madness.\"\nNow it's my understanding and with all due respect to Judge White, but the role of an appellate court is not to substitute the judgment of the court for that of the jury. And, particularly as, Senator Schumer, you or I as lay persons might say that going from a law-abiding citizen to a multiple cop-killer is madness or something akin to madness, that is not the legal definition of what constitutes a mental disease in our state.\nBut, putting that aside, I think you asked another good--and I'll just be very candid with you--I personally do not believe that a single dissent is sufficient to disqualify any federal jurist and I know I'm going out on a limb, because I am not a member of this body.\nSCHUMER: But, you know, that's a fair standard. I mean, if we were to use a single--take a single thing that Senator Ashcroft did and just saw the world through that prism, we wouldn't be being fair to him.\nHULSHOF: But, if I could be permitted to follow, just as I don't believe a jurist should be disqualified over one single dissent, neither does John Ashcroft. As he described for this panel over the last couple of days, a series of cases, in fact, as he talked about on the floor of the United States Senate during this confirmation process, a number of cases.\nAnd, Senator Schumer, just as you have said that we can have and reasonable minds can differ on whether this dissent was right or wrong, but clearly I also believe in John Ashcroft's defense that reasonable minds could have disagreed over whether or not Judge White was fit to be a jurist on the federal bench for the rest of his life. And that's the point.\nAgain, I am so deeply troubled and somewhat offended by some of the statements regarding John Ashcroft's vote against Ronnie White being racially motivated. The record seems to be clear. And you all have been discussing that because of in John Ashcroft's opinion, this series of cases by a single judge as that reflected on his fitness for office. And I think as John Ashcroft said on the floor, on October the 5th if I'm not mistaken, \"whether we as a Senate should sanction the life appointment to the responsibility of a district court judge for one who has earned a vote of no confidence from so many in the law enforcement community in the state in which he resides.\"\nAnd reasonable minds can differ on that, but clearly the fact that we are discussing those decisions and those qualifications has absolutely nothing to do with race. And so, that's the point of my...\nSCHUMER: Let me--Mr. Chairman?\nI was going to follow-up with a question, but if people are in a hurry, I do not have to do that. I'll defer. Go ahead. Is Senator Specter...\nLEAHY: Senator Specter is concerned that you had gone over. You had gone over the last time. And he went over earlier this morning. But if you want to refrain and go back...\nSPECTER: Well, not wait a minute, Mr. Chairman.\nThat red light's been on on the other side, including you, for a very protracted period of time.\nLEAHY: Two minutes and 21 seconds.\nSPECTER: And when I was questioning Judge White, I was cut off. And I just asked you a question, if the red light applies only on this side of the table? That's my question.\nSCHUMER: I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: I think the record will show that both sides have gone way over their time and that the chair has given a great deal of time to both sides; did not run the red light on either of the two witnesses, both Republican congressmen speaking on behalf of Senator Ashcroft; did run the red light on a number of people who spoke against him, so.\nSenator Thurmond?\nTHURMOND: Thank you.\nCongressman Watts and Congressman Hulshof, I greatly appreciate your appearance today on behalf of Senator Ashcroft. Your testimony is very important and beneficial to him, and we thank you.\nI also want to thank Sheriff Jones--Sheriff, hold up your hand, thank you--for being here. Your dedication and interest should be commended. I have the greatest respect for victims of crime. Crime is a terrible harm to our society, and society must be tough on crime. I thank you.\nLEAHY: Is that it?\nNow, there's an example of how to stay within the time.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThe distinguished senior senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\nDURBIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Congressman Watts and Congressman Hulshof, thank you for joining us today.\nI want to say at the outset that, like John Ashcroft and I believe yourself, Congressman Hulshof, I support the death penalty and I voted for the death penalty. That is not the issue here.\nWhen I read the Johnson case, this horrific, murderous rampage this man went on destroying innocent lives, including the lives of law enforcement, I can tell you that I feel sympathy for Sheriff Jones and all the families involved in this. There's no question about that.\nI come virtually to the same conclusion that Justice White did. If Mr. Johnson was in control of his faculties when he went on this murderous rampage, he assuredly deserved the death sentence he was given. But I have to disagree with one of the points that you've made, Congressman. For you to characterize Johnson's defense as a dream team really is a stretch.\nThis man who committed these murders signed a confession. If there was any defense, it was question of his mental capacity. And his defense counsel decided to construct a defense, which is novel, the post-traumatic stress syndrome, and then proceed to argue that before the jury. And he used as evidence of that the so-called perimeter, which was around the defendant's house, and the fact that the tires on his truck were flat, to say this reminded the defended that he was back in Vietnam and he broke and he did these terrible things.\nThis dream team defense counsel had failed to interview two state troopers in a death case, who were on the endorsed witness list. And in failing to interview these two state troopers, this defense dream team didn't realize the perimeter had not been created by the defendant but by the police. And the air was let out of the truck tires by the police, as well. His entire defense disintegrated in front of him.\nFrom the prosecution point of view, you were in a pretty strong position if the facts come out, as they were in this case. And his entire defense disappeared.\nI raise a question about your defense dream team's competence that they would not interview two state troopers on the endorsed witness list, who clearly would have given them information to rebut their entire defense. They got right smack dab in the middle of the trial and it disintegrated in front of him. Justice White says, based on this, he doesn't think they did a good job as defense attorneys.\nWell, I want to tell you this, if I had somebody important to me in my family who needed a defense attorney, I wouldn't be calling this dream team. And I don't believe John Ashcroft, if he becomes attorney general, would hire this defense dream team in the Department of Justice. At least I hope he would not.\nJustice White sat here this morning and said what he said repeatedly, he didn't believe James Johnson should be released. All he believed is that he was entitled to a fair trial and that the counsel he was given did not give him a fair trial.\nHow this comes together is this: You have a man who has devoted his life to the law, fought his way to complete law school, to be the attorney for the city of St. Louis, representing the police department, the first African-American to the Missouri Appellate Court, the first African-American to the Missouri Supreme Court, a lifetime of hard work and commitment to law who reaches this opportunity to become a federal district court judge, and he is rejected after 27 months dangling before this committee on the basis of three court cases, the DaMass (ph) case, which was cited by Senator Ashcroft, in which Justice White's opinion was confirmed by the Supreme Court as the appropriate standard, the Kinder case, where days before a trial a judge made--not just insensitive statements but racist statements--and the question was raised as to his bias, and the Johnson case.\nAnd I just have to say to you, Congressman, to have a man's entire legal career tossed aside, to have him characterized as pro-criminal, to ignore the clear statistics of his support for death penalty cases over and over again, raises a question in my mind as to whether or not he was treated fairly.\nI'd like to give you a chance to respond.\nHULSHOF: I appreciate that. It's interesting--if I could--I find myself in an unusual position, Senator Durbin, in that, as a tenure career prosecutor, that I'm defending defense counsel, the same individuals that, you know, you're adversaries against in the courtroom.\nBut let me put a couple of other facts out there because, as you stated--again, not taking notes from your statement--coming up with this extraordinary defense about this post-traumatic stress or, as lay people call, the Vietnam flashback syndrome.\nWhen Mr. Johnson was arrested, he gave a detailed confession and made reference to his service in Vietnam. When the hostage negotiator was trying to negotiate over the telephone before Mr. Johnson was apprehended--he had taken an 82-year-old woman, allowed her to leave--she informed law enforcements that the man you're looking for is in my house. And so the helicopters come in, and they surround the house, and an experienced hostage negotiator on a bullhorn says, pick up the phone. And then they commence a couple of hours of conversation on the telephone which was recorded.\nAnd during the course of that conversation, the defendant, James Johnson, was telling this highway patrol negotiator that: I'm the only one left from my platoon; my platoon leader has been killed. He even mentioned the name Sargent Kali (ph) or Lieutenant Kali (ph)--which of course if you follow Vietnam history, as this--by the way--highway patrol negotiator knew that Lieutenant Kali (ph) probably was a little older than Mr. Johnson. And so he was beginning to suspect that maybe Johnson was trying to conjure up his own defense.\nBut there were strong references during this back and forth, during the hostage negotiation time where the defendant Johnson was lacing his comments with gooks and other terminology that are consistent with those who had experience in Vietnam.\nNot only that--regarding the competency of counsel, they brought in three of the most nationally acclaimed experts on Post Traumatic Disorder. In fact, Dr. John Wilson (ph)--it's in the record--who I had a very difficult time on cross examination with, who is known by some as the father of post-traumatic stress disorder, who wrote the diagnostic and statistical manual on PTSD, was one of their witnesses. And they had this group of experts, renowned around the country.\nAnd so, again, reasonable minds can disagree over effective representation. But I can tell you, having been on the other side of this case in the courtroom, having to battle every day these exceptionally skilled attorneys, I believe that his representation was extremely adequate as far as assistance of counsel that the law requires.\nDURBIN: If you will spare me one closing sentence--if reasonable minds can disagree, can you understand how one justice on the Supreme Court might dissent in this case and not be pro-criminal and not be soft on the death penalty and have his entire legal career besmirched by those comments on the floor of the United States Senate.\nLEAHY: Both of us agree, go ahead with your answer.\nHULSHOF: If, Senator, you will also agree that during the confirmation process of Judge Ronnie White that reasonable minds could agree or disagree as to his fitness to be elevated to the bench. Again, I offer no opinion to that. But John Ashcroft, who you all are scrutinizing, just as his record is appropriately before you and the American people as to whether he is fit to be the attorney general of these United States, he took that same measure seriously his role then of advise and consent as he scrutinized the record of another jurist from his home state, who had raised the concerns of some in law enforcement, as to his fitness for the bench.\nAnd I think there was reasonable disagreement there, as well.\nDURBIN: Thank you.\nLEAHY: With that, we'll go to the senior senator from Pennsylvania.\nSPECTER: Thank you.\nCongressman Hulshof, Senator Durbin, I think you've both claimed very reasonable arguments. And the question which comes to my mind is, what impact does all of this have on the qualification of Senator Ashcroft to serve as attorney general?\nI think it is very important to focus on the testimony which Judge White gave, and the centerpiece was the opportunity for him to clear the record and to clear his name on what he considered to have been an improper handling of this matter, where his record was not accurately stated. And I think he had that opportunity today. But he did not say John Ashcroft should not be confirmed as attorney general, and he did not say or question Senator Ashcroft's motivations as being political. That accusation has been made on this side of the table.\nBut as to what the witness said, he did not make that point. And I pressed him on it, with great respect for his record. And I do believe that the Senate ought to change procedures, and we may handle confirmations which are successful without going into great detail by senators personally, although staff and FBI and bar association and Justice Department does it, so that he had his chance to say his side of it.\nBut the question--and you've already answered this in a wide variety of ways, as to the good faith of John Ashcroft and the judgment which he made, do you have any doubt--this is repetitious, but one more time--that there was an ample basis for the good faith judgment of Senator Bond and Senator Ashcroft in coming to the conclusions which they did as to Judge White's confirmation?\nHULSHOF: I appreciate the question. There is no question in my mind knowing John as I do, from as many years as a public servant in Missouri, elected twice as attorney general, twice as governor, once as United States senator, that he is a man of high integrity and character. And you probably know that as well as, or better than I, having worked along side your former colleague. And so, as he has answered many questions over his reasons for opposing the nomination of Judge White to the federal bench, I...\nSPECTER: Without taking too much more time.\nHULSHOF: I think that the fact that there are now individuals trying to target him with slurs, I think it is intolerable.\nSPECTER: Well, this has been the most heated confirmation process that I have seen. I'm in now my 21st year of serving on this committee and the confirmation process as to Judge Bork was no picnic and the confirmation as to Justice Thomas was no picnic and the confirmation process as to Chief Justice Rehnquist was pretty heated and we've had a great many controversial proceedings. But the kind of charges which have come from this side of the table on John Ashcroft being political, as to Judge White, it has to be emphasized didn't come from Judge White, didn't come from the witness. And there have been threats of filibuster, and if John Ashcroft is as bad as the witnesses on this side of the table have characterized him, as bad as the senators have characterized him, if he's that bad, they know how to stop him.\nBut it really isn't all that bad because when you strip down the issue we've been on for hours now as to Judge White, Judge White should have been treated differently by the Senate and there may have been some excessive statements made. But when you boil down Judge White's testimony, he does not say John Ashcroft should not be confirmed and he does not say that John Ashcroft acted out of a political motive or out of a biased motive.\nMy red light just went on. Thank you.\nLEAHY: If the senator wants to finish his question, feel free.\nI'll go to Senator Kyl. Not hearing an answer, I assume you don't want to.\nGo ahead, Senator Kyl.\nKYL: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a series of endorsements by various law enforcement organizations for Senator Ashcroft's confirmation, for the record.\nSecondly, I want to commend Sheriff Jones for being here under these circumstances, and I look forward to reading your testimony, sir. In particular, I hope that my colleagues read that part of the testimony which makes it clear that it was you who asked Senator Ashcroft to oppose the nomination, not the other way around. And it was you who initiated the petition drive of law enforcement officials in opposition or, at least, in semi-opposition to Ronnie White's nomination to the federal district bench.\nRepresentative Watts, as always, you are willing to sacrifice your time for others for what you believe is right. I thought your testimony was powerful. I've got to get that video for my grandkids.\nAnd Representative Hulshof, I appreciate your fine legal analysis. Because so much of this hearing did revolve around this particular case, I think your expertise has been very useful to the committee. The bottom line here is that this was a very skilled group of lawyers who were hired to defend a case that, frankly, was indefensible. And I will also submit for the record the actual finding of the judge and the findings of fact and conclusions of law that the team that you characterized as the \"dream team,\" to quote the court, was highly skilled and well-prepared for the case. It was not a matter of inadequacy of counsel. It was a matter of a case that, frankly, couldn't be defended. Clarence Darrow couldn't have gotten this guy off.\nAnd if we're going to hold otherwise, we're going to put ourselves in this Catch-22; either the jury acquits or it's error because the defense counsel couldn't find a way for the jury to acquit. That would mean no one ever gets convicted in a case like this.\nBut I'm troubled by two other things. Not only has there been some focus on the insanity defense here, but as you pointed out, it's not just a matter of the finding here, but also whether or not the alleged errors of defense counsel--inadequacy of defense counsel--had any effect on the jury. And of course, the majority opinion of the case said: Whatever the situation with regard to the defense counsel, it had no effect on the jury.\nNow, White disagreed with that.\nBut there were two other things pointed out. One of them was the statement that was read earlier, that while Mr. Johnson--this is in the dissent of Judge White--while Mr. Johnson may not, as the jury found, have met the legal definition of sanity, whatever drove him to go from law-abiding citizen to multiple killer was certainly something akin to madness.\nNow, there's a legal standard for insanity, and a judge is required to apply the law. And this is a case where apparently Judge White was willing to fly by the seat of his pants, not apply the law, because it just didn't seem right to him.\nBut the other thing that hasn't been brought up is something else from his dissent, and let me quote from it, at least in part. After the whole business about adequacy of defense counsel, he says, \"Even more troubling to me is an issue that the principal opinion doesn't address. It's the issue of mitigating factors.\" And the conclusion of Judge White is that because Mr. Johnson had not committed crimes previously, the jury might have been able to find that this four-time killer could warrant a sentence of life rather than death.\nNow, we heard the testimony of Colleen Campbell, who said that a judge with a big heart gave a criminal one more chance and he used it to kill her son. If you're one judge out of seven on the Missouri Supreme Court you can make an error like Judge White did and it doesn't have a negative impact on society. But he wanted to give Jimmy Johnson one more chance, and that error could have had grievous consequences.\nMy belief is that he was wrong on the law and that in effect he failed the law exam here sufficiently to justify us to not reward him with a lifetime appointment to the federal district court. There were other cases as well.\nBut I just want to make it crystal clear that, however well intentioned, however decent Judge White is, and he clearly is from his testimony here today, the Senate has no obligation to elevate him to a lifetime appointment to the district court, given the fact that he made the kind of errors that he did and that the court itself concluded he did.\nSo I think that helps to vindicate the judgment not only of the Senate, but also of Senator Ashcroft in opposing him.\nAnd incidentally, Mr. Chairman, just one final point. There has been an allegation by some on our side that Senator Ashcroft distorted the record of Ronnie White. Of course, every senator had full opportunity to clarify the record in the debate in the Senate. John Ashcroft was only one of 100, and there was full opportunity for debate and clarification if anybody had felt that necessary.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: Thank the senator from Arizona.\nThe senior senator from Ohio.\nDEWINE: I had no questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\nLEAHY: I can't tell you how much the chairman thanks the senior senator from Ohio.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSenator from Alabama.\nSESSIONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Not so lucky with me.\nCongressman Watts, thank you for coming. Thank you for all you do to advance good and healthy ideas in America. You just did a great job in Alabama recently speaking to a large group of young people, Fellowship of Christian Athletes. And it was a special time and they were really inspired and motivated by what you do. Maybe that those kinds of things will last longer than any laws we pass around here.\nCongressman Hulshof, I really appreciate your sharing with us here. And I tend to agree with John Kyl. The problem the defense had was, they had no defense. The guy was caught flat-footed and gave a detailed confession. So it strikes me that the defense was trying to do a home run, it's fourth and 10, on your own 30, and you just got to throw it up there. And a lot of times, it gets intercepted. Is that an unfair characterization of it?\nHULSHOF: I think that's an accurate depiction. I think law enforcement in this case, especially those that did the investigation deserve tremendous credit. The judge who presided over the trial did her job. I think the litigants battled furiously for the respective sides. The jury did their job. And then, the case went on to appeal.\nAnd then we had the decision that we've been discussing.\nSESSIONS: Now, with regard to judges in general, as a prosecutor, within the law enforcement and prosecutorial community, you know the judges that have consistently failed to follow the law; failed to give the prosecutor his fair due in court. And that's pretty well known around, isn't it?\nHULSHOF: Yes, sir.\nSESSIONS: Well, you know attorney generals like John Ashcroft and a prosecutor and former attorney general like I have been, feel an obligation and a duty when we put somebody on a lifetime federal bench, it's our responsibility to make sure, maybe give a particular assurance, that those people are going to give both sides of the case a fair shake. Would you think that's probably something that was in the former attorney general John Ashcroft's mind when he dealt with this case?\nHULSHOF: I do, Senator Sessions, as well as was pointed out in the statement that I read from Sheriff Jones, the extraordinary, for lack of a better term, effort by some law enforcement groups who saw this dissent and perhaps with some other cases, who raised this red flag to Senators Ashcroft and Bond.\nSESSIONS: And Sheriff Jones, we thank you for being here. I know most of the sheriffs in my state. Certainly, I knew the ones in my district when I was United States attorney, and the chiefs of police also. I respect them. I know they're good and decent people. And if they have serious concerns about a nominee, I'm going to listen to it.\nAnd John Ashcroft voted for every single African-American nominee presented by President Clinton, 26 out of 27 that came to floor vote, and he opposed this one from his own district where he had a particular responsibility, it seems to me, and he had a serious objection among the law enforcement community.\nThe Fraternal Order of Police and others have just issued an endorsement for Senator Ashcroft. And I want to offer that into the record.\nThe Fraternal Order of Police have issued a specific statement supporting John Ashcroft for attorney general. They represent 293,000 members nationwide. Is that a premier law enforcement agency, Congressman Hulshof?\nHULSHOF: It is, Senator Sessions.\nSESSIONS: As have the sheriff's association, the National Latino Peace Officers Association said, \"it is with sincere pleasure that I write on behalf of the men and women of the National Latino Police Officers Association in support of Senator Ashcroft's appointment to attorney general,\" and the letter goes on.\nThe Association of Former State Attorneys General have written, and here is a long list of former attorney generals around the country that have written in support of John Ashcroft for attorney general.\nI would offer those into the record.\nMr. Chairman, thank you. My time has expired.\nLEAHY: Did you have something further?\nSESSIONS: I will stay within my time.\nLEAHY: You'd be one of the very few on either side of the aisle that has, so I appreciate it.\nSESSIONS: I would just offer that and say there are other letters of significance from organizations that should be admitted.\nLEAHY: We'll keep the record open, of course, under our normal practice, for senators from either side of the aisle to submit letters or others.\nDoes the senator from Kansas wish to ask questions?\nBROWNBACK:: Yes, I would, if I could.\nThank you very much for coming in, Kenny, I appreciate that.\nJ.C., always great to see you. We came in together in the House of Representatives, and you've done very well, from your football days on forward. And Oklahoma's back in football, like when you were quarterbacking.\nBriefly, if I could, Congressman Hulshof, I think because the central issue--one of the central issues here has been Judge White and his record, not just the one case, but his record of what it was toward criminals, whether he would be tough on crime or if he was going to be soft on crime.\nI wanted to put into the record--and if you had a comment--the number of police organizations that were opposed to his appointment to the federal bench based upon that pattern of softness.\nAnd I'd particularly like the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs stated, this letter, September 2, 1999: We want to go on record with your offices as being opposed to his nomination, and hope you will vote against him for the federal bench, a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.\nAnd I'd also point out the National Sheriff's Association saying, I'm writing to ask you to join the National Sheriff's Association in opposing the nomination of Mr. Ronnie White to the federal judiciary. NSA strongly urges the United States Senate to defeat his appointment.\nAnd then, Sheriff Jones' letter--who I would to have loved to heard your testimony, as well in this case--opposed to his appointment to the federal bench.\nAnd then the Missouri Sheriffs' Association, asking that we strongly consider his dissenting opinion in the Jones--the Missouri v. Johnson case.\nIs that the pattern you spoke of, of why these organizations were all opposed to his taking the federal bench?\nHULSHOF: Again, without my own personal comments about it, I think Senator Ashcroft has indicated both on the floor when he was your former colleague, discussing various cases. I think many of those that we've talked about, the Johnson case, there was a Kinder case, there were some others. Again, I think he was also had the opportunity to be questioned about additional criminal cases. I think even since Judge White's nomination was defeated, there were additional cases that, perhaps, were brought forth in this process by your former colleague, an Irvin (ph) case and some others.\nAnd so, again, without offering my own opinion specifically about Judge White, that's not the purpose of me being here today. I think Senator Specter mentioned earlier that the point of these inquiries, of course, and the very difficult job that you have is the fitness for office for the office of attorney general for John Ashcroft.\nAnd I think that, especially as a fellow Missourian, these charges of racially motivated reasons for defeating Judge White's nomination are really--there's no information or evidence to that. And clearly, I would just urge--as I could--as John Ashcroft is a man of the highest moral integrity and character, I think he would make an exceptionally qualified U.S. attorney general.\nBROWNBACK: Congressman Watts, you have been here, and thank you for participating. I don't know if you had had any follow-up comments that you would like to make. I direct your attention particularly to--there have been a number of innuendoes and allegations towards John Ashcroft's racial sensitivities, and if you know John and if you have any comments regarding any of those comments that others have made.\nWATTS: Senator, I've just--I shared in my testimony and in my statement that I've dealt with John for the last six years. I've campaigned with him in his home state. I've worked with him on legislation concerning poor communities, under-served communities. I have always found John Ashcroft to have nothing but the utmost respect and dignity for one's skin color.\nI heard John say yesterday in some of his testimony that his faith requires him to respect one's skin color. And I think that's the way it should be. So I have not--in my dealings with John, I have had nothing but the utmost respect for him when it comes to his dealings with people of different skin color.\nBROWNBACK: Thank you very much.\nLEAHY: Thank you both for joining us, too.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSESSIONS: ... for one more letter...\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama can interrupt any time he'd like.\nSESSIONS: You're very kind. You've been very patient. This is from the Mercer County prosecuting attorney's office. In the note--some have objected to John Ashcroft's use of the word \"anti-law enforcement,\" but this is the letter he had back at that time: Judge White's record is unmistakenly anti-law enforcement, and we believe his nomination should be defeated. His rulings and dissenting opinions on capital cases and on Fourth Amendment issues should be disqualifying factors when considering his nomination. Judge White has evidenced clear bias against the death penalty from his seat on the Missouri Supreme Court.\nAnd it goes on for another page and a half. But I would just offer that as a basis for Senator Ashcroft to have said what he said.\nLEAHY: I'm sure that will be part of the debate for the next several weeks, but I would also not as we have put in the record the endorsements from a number of significant police organizations and individual police officers in Missouri for the nomination of Judge White to be a federal district court judge. A number who endorsed him for that; a number who said they considered him far more concerned with victims than with criminals.\nWith that, we will...\nHATCH: If I could just make one last comment, which of course makes my point that there's recent debate on either side of this issue and it's a little offensive to have some accusing Senator Ashcroft of insensitivity, and I think this particular panel has been very important in helping us to understand that.\nI think we should be a little more careful before we start finding fault with colleagues. I don't find fault with those who voted for Judge White; I don't find fault with those who voted against Judge White.\nLEAHY: Ultimately, of course, the question comes down to how 100 United States senators will vote on John Ashcroft.\nHATCH: Right.\nLEAHY: And that vote will not be held today. Eventually it will be held and that will be the question.\nI do thank our two colleagues from the House, both valued members of that body, and they have been most patient. I will announce the program when we come back at 2:30. We will go back to questions of the panel that was interrupted to allow the members of the House to testify.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: Thank you all. And I--as sometimes happens in these things, we have to move things around, and I apologize for that.\nI'm going to one of the few more senior members of the panel, and our former chairman, Senator Kennedy, and then go in normal rotation to Senator Hatch and then back to me.\nI seem to--I don't think it's the altitude, unless it's the altitude of the office, I seem to have developed a bit of a nose bleed, so I'm going to step out.\nHATCH: If I can, Mr. Chairman, when you go to me, I'm going to defer to Senator Specter who needs to be at another confirmation.\nLEAHY: Of course. Would you rather go first?\nSPECTER: No, but it's good of you.\nKENNEDY: Thank you very much. And I want to thank the panel very much for the very, very helpful commentary. And I know the five-minute rule made it difficult, but the other information the committee is very, very valuable.\nI'd like to direct my first question to Harriet Woods. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Senator Ashcroft testified that the state of Missouri was not responsible for the segregation in St. Louis schools and he was simply fulfilling his duty to defend the state when he so strongly opposed the city's voluntary desegregation plan. Is that an accurate description of what really happened?\nWOODS: It is not, Senator. And I think it's one of the most troubling aspects to me of this nomination, because there is--as you well know and pointed out, there is no more serious challenge to this country than reaching a resolution on some of these lingering issues related to race. And the fact that he would say that he was just appearing as attorney general but protecting the state from liability, because there was no liability--the history of Missouri--at one time, it was a crime to educate black children. The ministers had to take them out on boats in the river. There was a constitutional amendment requiring segregation of schools.\nI served in the state senate at a time, and frankly I think it lingers to this day, when there was resistance to providing more funds to the urban schools. So for these families to find no resolution to a good education for their children at either the state or local level, neither one of them really willing to assume the responsibility for remedying what was a long, clear injustice to African-American children was what brought on the federal suit.\nAnd to have the attorney general of the state--not even seemingly who was born and raised in Missouri, who told us, well, yes, he knew about this, you know, 1954 decision when the black child came into his class, that he was not conscious that there was a state liability, really is worrisome because that could be transferred to the federal level: no liability, no responsibility. And I--you can tell, I'm really appalled.\nKENNEDY: Well, I think, in fairness to the senator, he'd indicated that the state was not involved--we've had contrary testimony to that in the holdings of the court. This went on for some eight years as he was attorney general, and eight years as governor, am I correct, that this issue was not settled?\nWOODS: It not only went on, but as you know--and I certainly don't want to take up all the time and I know you're going to have other testimony from other witnesses--but even to the extent of impeding or trying to block efforts at voluntary resolution, which you would think he would be happy about, in terms of if the local districts, if the state could assist a voluntary remedy, and if the courts themselves chastised the attorney general for foot-dragging and for getting in the way, I mean, it seems to me this is more than just routine representation of a state.\nKENNEDY: On another issue that I raised with Senator Ashcroft on the first day, he defended his veto of two voter registration bills by citing support for his action from a few Democrats in the city of St. Louis. That's the situation where there was the one piece of legislation that provided the voting registrars for St. Louis, and then he vetoed on that, because he said that that was only targeted in one city. And then, legislature, as I understand it, passed legislation to encompass the whole state; he vetoed that, as well.\nThe results have been that it was a very dramatic falling off of black registered voters during that period of time, when other groups, like the League of Women Voters, were out registering in the county itself surrounding the city. I believe there were 1,500 active registrars out in the area just surrounding the city.\nAnd for special reasons, that you know, this is really a function of the governor. The governor has this responsibility under--as I understand--under Missouri law.\nCould you make any comment on that? What was happening at that time and what kind of value do you give to that?\nWOODS: Well, I sometimes wear the hat as a member of the League of Women Voters. But what you're pointing out--I was interested in your inquiry, because it is quite true that in the suburban areas, the more affluent citizens, the Board of Election Commissioners did deputize the members of the League of Women Voters and other groups to make it easier to register. This was not true in the city of St. Louis where the majority of African-Americans live.\nNow, the point, you really brought this out, but what it seemed to me needed to be brought out with--Senator Ashcroft said, well, he checked with the local Board of Election Commission. And the local Democratic--white Democratic elected official said, \"We aren't interested in doing this.\"\nEveryone from Missouri, from the St. Louis, understands that by tradition there is the white south side in local politics and the black north side. And I can assure you that by tradition, by simple practical politics, the white Democratic politicians on the south side are no more eager than Republicans to get a big turnout, but because of its impact on local elections from the African-Americans on the north side.\nSo to say they agree, it's a little like saying that Eisenhower--President Eisenhower called up the politicians in Arkansas and said, \"Hey, do you want us to just come in and do something about getting these kids into the schools?\" And when they say, \"No,\" say, \"Oh, OK, we won't do it.\"\nThat was not his role. His role should have been looking out to make it easier for people of whatever background to be able to exercise their vote and not to reach agreements with politicians about keeping them from doing so. There's no reason why there couldn't have deputizing in the city of St. Louis.\nKENNEDY: As a result of that failure, is it your understanding that there were hundreds of thousands of eligible black voters that were effectively denied...\nWOODS: Well, I would say they certainly were...\nKENNEDY: ... the opportunity to register and participating in the votes?\nWOODS: It was certainly a discouragement for thousands of African-American voters, who had to go to a much greater length to do what could be done easily in more affluent areas.\nKENNEDY: If I could, I'd like to ask Gloria Feldt on Senator Ashcroft's extreme position against contraception. He supported the Human Life Amendment which prohibited the use of common forms of contraception, tried to stop the federal employees health benefit plans when covering the costs of contraceptions approved by FDA, including the commonly-used birth control pills and IUD. He has used the power of high office to block against family planning services.\nLet me ask you, would you tell the committee how much impact, if any, the attorney general's office could have on the right to access to contraceptives? What is your reaction, given the assure that you had received yesterday, and the power of the attorney general, what lies ahead in terms of the potential danger of actions that would limit those contraceptives to women?\nFELDT: Thank you, Senator.\nJust to clarify the basis of this point, the medical, scientific definition of pregnancy is implantation. The version of the so-called Human Life Amendment that Senator Ashcroft has supported throughout his entire career is a version which would outlaw all abortion. And it defines, quote, \"life\" meaning personhood, giving the legal status of personhood upon fertilization.\nWhat that means is that most of the methods of birth control that we are accustomed to having available to us, such as many kinds of birth control pills, the IUD, injectables and so forth, are thought of by Senator Ashcroft as abortifacients. And that is confirmed in the \"Dear Colleague\" letter that he signed to members of the Senate in opposition to federal employees' insurance coverage of contraception in their plans.\nAs attorney general, I think that his interpretation of when personhood--I mean the legal status of personhood begins would be a very major factor in interpreting and crafting and advising.\nBut there are other more, sort of, not as obvious areas where his interpretation could have an impact. For example, he could be asked by the Department of Health and Human Services to give some guidance with respect to family planning programs, Title X of the Public Health Services Act, which provides a wide array of--in fact, all medically approved birth control methods to low-income women who are primarily uninsured women, as well.\nSo it is not inconceivable that the attorney general could be asked to define what is a contraceptive under this program. And in so doing, render most of the commonly used, and by the way, most effective means of contraception, no longer usable within the family planning program.\nSimilarly, emergency contraception, which can be taken within 72 hours after intercourse and can prevent a pregnancy from occurring, could be given that same approach. And emergency contraception has been found by researchers to--if all women of reproductive age had access to it, emergency contraception could reduce the unintended pregnancy rate and the abortion rate by one-half. So ironically, the outcome could be actually an increase, ultimately, in the rate of abortion because of a lack of birth control access.\nSenator Kennedy, I wonder if I just might add...\nKENNEDY: I think my time--I'd like to, but I think my time is up, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: We will go 10 minutes to the senator from Pennsylvania and then five minutes to everybody else, because the senator from Massachusetts had 10 minutes.\nSPECTER: Thank you, Senator Hatch for yielding to me. I have other commitments and obviously a tough day.\nHATCH: We understand.\nSPECTER: I appreciate a chance to take this round now. I can understand the concern which has been expressed about a woman's right to choose. And I agree with what Ms. Michelman has said that we wouldn't tolerate dismantling Brown v. Board of Education.\nAnd similarly, we can't tolerate dismantling Roe v. Wade. And if I thought that Senator Ashcroft would do that, I wouldn't support him.\nThe issue about what will happen with judges and marshals and U.S. attorneys, at least the practice in the 12 years of President Reagan and President Bush, has been that senators have significant amount to say about who those individuals will be. And I can tell you with certainty that they'll be some passionate activism, to use your terms, Ms. Feldt, on that subject.\nAnd the Republicans, who have been appointed in Pennsylvania, have been noted nationally for balance and moderation, if I may use that word.\nWhen it is said that there's an expectation that the president would appoint a conservative, that really is an understatement, because of the way the political process works and the way the primary process works.\nI spent the better part of the year seeking the Republican nomination for 1996 fully aware of the virtual impossibility of it, but believing that there ought to be a centrist view within the party. And being the only pro-choice Republican in a large field, with about 50 percent of the Republicans being pro-choice, it seemed to me that there was an opportunity.\nI was the only candidate to favor retaining the Department of Education. At least we won that one, although I didn't win it, but there still is a Department of Education.\nBut I point this out, because of the concerns I have about having some balance within the Republican Party. We sought to change the platform, to take out the litmus test and to take out the provision to overturn Roe v. Wade. And President-elect Bush did make commitments on both of those lines, but they weren't as binding as a platform change, in my opinion. And I tried to do that. Not successfully.\nAnd we do have very firm commitments on the record from Senator Ashcroft that he's not going to move to overturn Roe v. Wade by a constitutional amendment. And the fact is, he couldn't if he tried. We've had a Republican Congress for six years and now going into eight years, and nobody's even made an effort. At least not a serious effort.\nAnd there's a firm commitment that he's not going to use a litmus test. And with the 50-50 split I think that's an enforceable commitment, both as to the president-elect and as to Senator Ashcroft, if he is, in fact, confirmed.\nSo that my question goes to the point about trying to get centrist Republicans to adopt the Feldt doctrine of passionate activism. And maybe even making a heretical suggestion that some Democrats might want to become Republicans to provide some of the Javits and Hines and Scott and Arlen Specter point of view. There are some places where people are assigned to both parties, so that there's a voice.\nAnd if you have to give credit to the activists who have dominated the party, the Republican Party. They've done the work, they've been the passionate activists. And we do have a political system, and there is a way to make a modification of it. So that when we come to a hearing of this sort--and I haven't hidden it. I've wrote a New York Times article saying that--perhaps, a little presumptuously--saying that the president-elect ought to appoint centrists. But that's the kind of balance we need.\nBut if there is more of a base in the primary process, where a very small number control the outcome and nominate the president, there'd be a change.\nMs. Michelman, you're a practical--you're a pragmatist. I know that because I see you working out in the gym with some regularity; we go to the same health club.\nHow about getting some people who have your passionate activism to become Republicans, to influence the political process so that you have a voice in who the Cabinet officers are, even attorney general?\nMICHELMAN: I couldn't agree with you more, Senator, that it is so important to recognize that the freedom to choose is not a matter of partisan politics. It's a fundamental right of women, and it is a fundamental right that guarantees women equality.\nThe reason that I mention Brown v. Board of Education in my comments earlier on was because there were signature decisions along the way. As those of us in society who were not guaranteed freedoms and equality by the constitution, we had to struggle for those rights. And Brown v. Board was an essential milestone along the way to full emancipation, full protection, full equality for African-Americans.\nSo too, Roe v. Wade, as Justice Blackmun I thought so eloquently put it, was necessary as women continued their journey toward full equality and full emancipation.\nSPECTER: Ms. Michelman, I think...\nMICHELMAN: So it is an issue that rises above and transcends. The problem we have here is that--I agree with you--we need more Republicans--and I have tremendous admiration for the fact that you did run, and I wish that you had been the nominee on the other side.\nBut that is a long-term effort that we have to engage in--both short term and long term...\nSPECTER: Ms. Michelman, let me interrupt you because the time is fleeting. You said the other side; how about joining my side?\n(LAUGHTER)\nMICHELMAN: Joining your side?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSPECTER: Yes, how about joining the Republican side?\n(LAUGHTER)\nHATCH: Don't be so shocked here. I've never seen such a shocked look on your face.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSPECTER: You don't have to convince Senator Kennedy.\nMICHELMAN: I am an independent, myself. I think with all kidding aside here, though.\nSPECTER: I'm not kidding.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMICHELMAN: The issue before us is whether we are going to have an attorney general that will respect, defend and protect women's established constitutional rights.\nWhile we work to bring more pro-choice Republicans into political positions, we have got to start now making sure that we don't have an attorney general who is a pathway to overturning Roe v. Wade.\nSPECTER: Ms. Michelman, I have to interrupt you because time is fleeting.\nMICHELMAN: The human life amendment is a little bit of a straw man here, with all due respect.\nSPECTER: I have to interrupt because time is fleeting, and I'm not doing very well with you. I want to turn to Ms. Feldt.\nHow about joining up Ms. Feldt? How about being passionate to try to influence the other party, make it your party, and have a place at the table?\nFELDT: Senator, as you may know, Planned Parenthood has a very large and very active Republicans for Choice group that is forming chapters faster than you can imagine all over the country and has been active, actually, for some years.\nI just want to tell you a little bit about my own personal experience. You know, I ran the affiliate in Arizona for 18 years. That affiliate was started by Peggy Goldwater. And Barry Goldwater, Mr. Conservative himself, is the person who taught me that a true conservative doesn't want the government telling people what to do about their own personal, private reproductive choices.\nSPECTER: Barry Goldwater was the pre-eminent conservative who said keep the government off your backs, out of your pocketbooks, and out of your bedrooms.\nWell, we need to get those Republicans in Planned Parenthood more active.\nMICHELMAN: We're working on that, Senator.\nSPECTER: Marcia Greenberger, how about it? Will you join us?\nI'm recruiting.\nGREENBERGER: Well, the thing is, as I've been sitting and listening to this conversation, I, of course, come from an organization that is nonpartisan entirely, and I think the point of all of this is whether Republican or Democrat, for this Senate, for those who believe in Roe v. Wade, Senator Specter, as you do, the issue isn't what party you are, the issue is, what is your commitment to the principle of Roe v. Wade and other constitutional principles at stake here, including 14th Amendment equal protection, so important for women and minorities?\nAnd I do want to say, respectfully, that you said if you were convinced that Senator Ashcroft would overturn Roe v. Wade, you wouldn't support him. And you cited a constitutional amendment and the litmus test points. And I wanted to go to those points precisely.\nHe can--and I think our concern is that he will--effectively overturn Roe v. Wade, not through a constitutional amendment which an attorney general, we agree, would not have a role in pursuing, but by defining Roe v. Wade, even if he says he's not trying to overturn it, in such a loose fashion that it is completely eviscerated.\nAnd I want to say that when he came as the Missouri attorney general to this United States Senate in Washington in 1981 and testified in favor of the human life bill, bill, statute, not constitutional amendment, which Gloria Feldt described, and how extreme it was, he said, among the legal points he was making, that it was constitutional under Roe v. Wade.\nWhen he has committed not to try to turn over Roe v. Wade--and I want to question the commitment he even gave on that, because he said he didn't think it was an agenda, he didn't really commit even on that point--what did he mean by Roe v. Wade if he could come and testify that Roe v. Wade was consistent with his human life bill that he was supporting? It is the antithesis of Roe v. Wade.\nSo for him to say that he won't seek as an activist agenda matter to overturn Roe v. Wade, but what he means by that is that he can still push for and find constitutional under Roe v. Wade as attorney general his human life bill, then I cannot help but say, the American women in this country and all of us who care about the right to choose were given no guarantee whatsoever by what we heard.\nSPECTER: I appreciate your arguments, but it comes back to a place at the table, and a basis in the party. And I would urge you to consider what I have said so that you have a place at the big table. Thank you very much.\nThank you, Senator Hatch.\nLEAHY: Mr. Susman?\nI can imagine that the nurses in the case in 1983 that you mentioned earlier were very upset to be threatened to go to jail after then-Attorney General Ashcroft issued his opinion to stop nurses from providing access to contraceptives in family planning services.\nMy wife is a registered nurse. I can imagine what her reaction would be if somebody told her she would go to jail if she told a patient anything about contraceptives or family planning services. It sounds like something out of the 19th century.\nNow how significant was this case, and the defeat of what then-Attorney General Ashcroft tried to do to the nurses in Missouri?\nSUSMAN: I think you can tell the significance of the case by merely going to Exhibit A of the Supreme Court's decision, which list the amicus parties that were involved in this case who saw fit to have their voices from all around the country heard by the Missouri Supreme Court.\nBut you have to remember that they not only were going to charge the nurses with crimes of practicing medicine without a license, the state Board of Registration for the Healing Arts also told the physicians who were writing these standing orders that they would be charged with the crime of aiding and abetting the nurses by actually writing these orders.\nThis is a practice that was in effect in 40 of the 50 states at the time. It was not uncommon for advanced nurse practitioners to do all of these services that I listed. This was routine. This is the way of every county health department.\nLEAHY: I want to make sure I understand this. Under then-Attorney General Ashcroft's position, the doctor wrote an order for a contraceptive. The nurse practitioner--and they require a high level of skill and advanced degree and all--they then were to pass out the contraceptive following the doctor' orders. They could both go to jail?\nSUSMAN: Oh absolutely. Practicing medicine without a license...\nLEAHY: Kind of a 19th century...\nSUSMAN: It caused panic because many of the doctors in these family planning clinics resigned just from the threat, resigned their practices.\nLEAHY: So the concern that you were expressing this morning is not just the question of Senator Ashcroft's position on a woman's right to choose, but on a woman's right to choose, in this case, the method of contraception?\nSUSMAN: Absolutely. That's all the case dealt with was contraception. I mean, family planning clinics--and again, these were in the federally designated low-income counties, counties in which you did not have a single physician who would give prenatal or child birth services to women because of the low rate of pay established by the Missouri Medicaid program. Not a single physician in these counties offered services to indigent women. And this was the only outlet for indigent women to be able to control the reproductive destinies that were being shut down.\nLEAHY: Mr. Hunter, I notice in your testimony you mentioned the Mound City Bar Association of St. Louis, one of the oldest African-American bar associations in the country, incidentally, one of the most respected ones, commended John Ashcroft in 1991 for appointing an African-American judge. Is that correct?\nHUNTER: That's correct.\nLEAHY: But you don't know for the record that the Mound City Bar Association, however, has come out against John Ashcroft to be attorney general. And they have stated very clearly that they oppose his nomination based on his treatment of Judge Ronnie White.\nI will enter their letter into the record. But they say, among other things, they see the attack on Judge White as \"an attack on all persons who possess similar values. The MCBA has long stood for the rights of the accused to get a trail free from bias. That Judge White's position is similar to us. Mr. Ashcroft has spoiled an opportunity for a federal bench to become a more diverse institution.\n\"Consequently, while we have been silent on this nomination up to this point, because of the impression left by previous statements of the association we must make it clear that this is not a nomination that we can support. Simply put, the chickens have come home to roost.\"\nMs. Woods, Senator Ashcroft, I feel, deserves credit for selecting Mr. Hunter as his first secretary of labor when he served as governor of Missouri, 1985 to 1993. And I understand, Mr. Hunter, you set a standard that other governors could look at for similar positions.\nBut Senator Ashcroft, in his opening statement, stated during the governorship he took special care to expand racial and gender diversity in Missouri's courts. I need to ask a little bit about that. As his lieutenant governor, I'm sure you're familiar with his record. And tell me if this is correct: Mr. Hunter was the only African-American or minority to serve in then-Governor Ashcroft's Cabinet, which is made up of 15 department directors, during his first four years. The African-American leaders in Missouri were critical of his failure to appoint more minorities.\nWOODS: Yes. The answer is there was just one appointment, just as there was only one woman appointment.\nThe head of the National Association of Blacks Within Government noted in 1988 this one black member in Ashcroft's Cabinet, but that in, quote, \"most offices in Jefferson City, it's an ocean of whiteness,\" unquote.\nLEAHY: And do you know Representative O.L. Shelton?\nWOODS: Oh, yes, the represent--and he reacted to the failure to sign the--oh, I'm sorry.\nLEAHY: No, go ahead.\nWOODS: You know, there's so many things that I think have caused the African-American community to feel that Senator Ashcroft could not be counted on to give them justice. And one of them was Senator Ashcroft--Governor Ashcroft's, then, being one of only two people who refused to sign the \"One-Third of America\" report, which was signed by former presidents, Republican and Democrat, and, of course, Coretta Scott King, because he said that it really exaggerated the plight of African-Americans.\nAnd whether one differed or not with a degree, this was a chance in a national report to bring the attention of the whole country if you really wanted to provide leadership, if you really were concerned.\nAnd let me just add one other thing, he and I served on something called the Board of Public Buildings, which handled contracts in state government. And it was perfectly obvious that minorities and women were not getting a full share of state business.\nBut his response was, you know, \"Whatever we're doing is law.\" My response was, \"We've got to be creative. We've got to reshape these contracts so that small contractors, as minority and women usually are, can get them.\" He wouldn't do anything, and ultimately, our office just refused to sign one of the contracts until they started the minority program.\nSo what I'm saying to you is about this--and I realize you gave me a specific question about his position--I just don't feel this was priority for him to open up more opportunities.\nLEAHY: Does anybody here disagree that his human life act, which he introduced, was patently unconstitutional on its face, the act that he subscribed to and urged passage of, the act that would basically by a statute overturn Roe V. Wade? Does anybody feel it is constitutional?\n(CROSSTALK)\nLEAHY: I'll take it by your answers, everybody feels it's unconstitutional. Thank you.\nSenator Hatch?\nHATCH: Judge Robertson, I've been led to believe that in the nurse's case, Attorney General Ashcroft never questioned the constitutionality of the statute in question. Additionally, not only did the Office of Attorney General represent the board, it also filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Board of Nursing, urging an interpretation of the statute consistent with the position taken by the nurses.\nNow the Supreme Court's opinion, as I understand it, agreed with the position taken in the amicus brief. Am I wrong in that?\nROBERTSON: No, Senator, you're 100 percent right. When I read the news account of this Surmchief (ph) case, as the person who was responsible for approving much of the litigation in the attorney general's office during this period of time, it didn't read like anything that I had been involved in. And so I went and got some research done.\nWhat I discovered was that the Board of Healing Arts was represented by private counsel and not the attorney general's office; that the doctors had enough money to pay private counsel and not use the state lawyers. That's first.\nSecond, that Mr. Susman filed the lawsuit after the Board of Healing Arts, on the advice of their counsel, indicated that they might be in violation of the law. The attorney general's office merely intervened to protect that constitutionality of the statute.\nAnd I have the briefs filed, Senator, by the attorney general's office in the Missouri Supreme Court with me today. One of them, on behalf of the Board of Nursing, and I'm going to quote from it if I might, urges the court to find that the law under question should be interpreted, \"broad in scope allowing flexibility in nursing practices.\" That's the first brief.\nThe second brief, filed on the merits by the attorney general's office, indicates to the Supreme Court merely that the attorney general's office was intervening for the sole purpose of protecting the constitutionality of the statute and took no position whatsoever on the question of what the nurses could or couldn't do.\nAll of these acts were consistent with the attorney general responsibilities and are inconsistent with some of the testimony that you've heard today.\nHATCH: Well, Mr. Chairman, I believe Senator Kennedy expressed concern yesterday and again today that the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners, that he alleged was appointed by Senator Ashcroft, may have refused to deputize private voter registration volunteers because these voters were primarily African-American and voted Democratic. At least that's the accusation.\nNow I thought it would be of interest to the committee to know that the city board--and you correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe I am--the city board had a long history of refusing to deputize private voter registration deputies, long before John Ashcroft appointed anyone to that board. I know this because a lawsuit was filed against the members of the St. Louis board appointed in 1981, alleging the same concerns that Senator Kennedy expressed, and the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri explicitly rejected charged of racial animus, finding that the board properly refused to deputize volunteers to prevent fraud, ensure impartiality and administrative efficiency. Now these conclusions were sustained by the 8th Circuit, as I understand it, in an opinion by Judge McMillan (ph), a prominent African-American jurist.\nNow, if I could, I'd like to submit copies of those opinions for the record.\nNow, Judge Robertson, do you have anything to add to that? And, also, would you like to comment on some of the assertions of Ms. Woods here today? Your statement was followed by Lieutenant Governor Woods, who described a number of actions by then-Governor Ashcroft. So I'd appreciate it if you'd cover those two areas and any others you'd care to cover.\nROBERTSON: Thank you, Senator.\nGovernor Woods and I used to play tennis together when we were in Jefferson City. And we've even been on the same side, but it doesn't appear that we've made that jump today.\nLet me suggest that the case that Governor Woods spoke of, with regard to the lieutenant governor's authority, comes from a history in Missouri where there was a governor who was literally held hostage in the state by a lieutenant governor...\n(UNKNOWN): Excuse me, just for a moment, Mr. Chairman, it is very difficult to hear on this end. I just wonder, is there a way you could speak more directly into the microphone?\nLEAHY: Well, really the sound system is leaving something to be desired. There are dead places in the sound. Maybe we could ask one of the engineers to see if they could boost it up.\nGo ahead.\nROBERTSON: You see, the red light's on.\nLEAHY: No, that's fine.\nROBERTSON: Some of the time's been eaten up here.\nAn 1883 of the Missouri Supreme Court, which was cited in the case to which Governor Woods referred, ruled that when the governor of Missouri was out of the state he could still receive compensation. And I think Governor Ashcroft's comments with Governor Woods at the time were designed merely to say, \"Let's try and get along, but if we don't, I have legal authority here from an 1883 Supreme Court decision that makes it sure that I don't have to tell you when I leave the state.\"\nAbsent that authority, I believe he would never have had the conversation which he reports.\nHATCH: Thank you. Just one last question. I'd like to ask Ms. Campbell this question. Some have tried to call John Ashcroft insensitive, among other things that are not justified by his private deportment and, you know, public record.\nMs. Campbell, I wonder if you would discuss whether you and the people you represent feel John Ashcroft is sensitive to victims of crime and why you and your groups think John Ashcroft is the right person to be attorney general from the perspective of crime victims.\nCAMPBELL: Well, Senator Hatch, let me tell you--particularly this week, I wouldn't have been here if I didn't have a lot of people feeling very strong about this. And I'm sorry--Senator Feinstein wasn't here a while ago, but the 12 victims' organizations in the state asked me to come here because they had followed Ashcroft's record as to what he's been doing.\nOne of the things that he did was work on the victims constitutional amendment that Senator Feinstein was working on and was very involved in that. Not too many people got deeply involved in that--Senator Kyl did--and that tried to address, on a federal level, a lot of the inadequacies that we have on the state level.\nIf we had three days, I could go over the things that are happening that shouldn't be happening to victims. Victims are probably the only people that didn't do anything to get where they are. It just happens that anybody in this room could share the pain that I'm feeling right now just like that.\nAnd things like--that I endured--and when I say I, I can only speak for myself because everybody this goes through this. Both of the men that strangled my son and threw him out of an airplane, they were being tried for special circumstances--the death penalty. In the state of California, they're not entitled to bail, but guess what? They had bail.\nThey appointed four defense attorneys for them. We had a deputy DA that, bless his heart, we were his first case, and he was very overworked. I had to ride up the elevator with the two men that strangled my son.\nNow, I don't know what you can do about things like that. But that's trying a mom right to the top because I hate to tell you the thoughts that I had on that elevator. And we would have been able to not have the trial any further if what I wanted to do I would have done.\nBut there is a notice of appeal, a situation where they filed an appeal. The men were in prison. All of the family members of the murderers were notified. Not us. We read it in the headlines of the front paper that the men who murdered our son were out.\nThese are the things that John was trying to do something about in the victims' bill of rights, saying that people are notified, that they can protect themselves. It's just common sense saying that unless you're there, you don't know what is taking place in our country.\nAnd if anybody says he is insensitive, I've got to tell you, I've got a bone to pick with them because he was on board a long time ago.\nHATCH: Thank you very much.\nCAMPBELL: And at this time, I'd sure like to thank my senator from the state of California for all she has done for victims' rights. I really do appreciate it. And that's a Republican to a Democrat, and I called and told her that I voted for her.\nLEAHY: Well, you voted right. She's a good person. We're fortunate to have her on this committee.\nYou have a request?\nKENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, in response to Senator Hatch's comments about the registration in St. Louis, I'd like to include in the record at this time what the registration was when Governor Ashcroft became governor and then the collapse in black registration in St. Louis when he left it.\nAnd then how it increased again when Governor Carnahan came in. I'll put those statistics--and I think they speak very clearly for themselves.\nHATCH: Well, my point was the Democrats controlled the process. I don't know how you blame Senator Ashcroft for that.\nKENNEDY: Excuse me, excuse me, they did not, when the governor was the governor, he controlled the process, Senator. He is the one who vetoed...\nHATCH: I thought the boards controlled the process.\nKENNEDY: No. He has the--under the Constitution, under the Missouri Constitution, he has the direct responsibility.\nHATCH: Yes, blame him.\nLEAHY: Gentlemen, please; a little understanding. We have to understand that if anything good happened apparently while Senator Ashcroft was governor then he takes full credit for it. And if things weren't done right when he was governor, then the governor had nothing to do with it. You've got to have it one way or the other.\n(UNKNOWN): Just like the presidency, right, Mr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: Just like the presidency. You can't have it both ways.\nThe senator from California?\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nI want to welcome you here, Mrs. Campbell, very much. I'm very sorry what happened to your son. You should know that my leader on the victims' rights constitutional amendment is Senator Kyl. We got it out on the floor at the last session. We came acropper. We withdrew it. We will resubmit it this session. And I hope...\nCAMPBELL: I want to be here when you do, and I don't want it weakened.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, thank you. I appreciate that.\nAnd Kate, if I might say to you, I'm really pleased that you mentioned--although it was very brief and I don't know if people really heard it--how important Roe really is in this whole effort of women for equality. And I think many people in this country think women were born with this equality. And they don't realize we couldn't inherit property, we couldn't get a higher education, we couldn't own property, we couldn't vote for so many years of this nation's life. And that the ability not to have politicians interfering with our reproductive system is really a very important concept in women being able to stand tall and make their own decisions based on their religion, their beliefs, their morality, their family. And that that's really what this is all about. And that's why it's so important to those of us who are pro-choice.\nNow, having said all of this, I'm one of those that was really amazed when Senator Ashcroft said, \"Roe has been settled, I respect that. I will not bring a case.\" When he also said, in response to a question, he will maintain the task forces.\nI wanted to ask people that are really knowledgeable in this area, with respect to the access to clinics, which is known as FACE--everything here gets to be an acronym. I kind of don't like it; I like to say what it is. But in that act there are some specific terms.\nFor example, Section 3-E, the term \"interfere with means to restrict a person's freedom of movement.\" Also, in 3-E, \"intimidate means to place a person in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm to him or herself or another.\" Section 3-E, \"physical obstruction means rendering impassable ingress to or egress from a facility that provides reproductive health facilities, or rendering passage to or from such a facility unreasonably difficult or hazardous.\"\nNow there is some concern about changes of definitions. Do any of you support any change of definition, or are those the definitions that you feel are really important, and as part of any attorney general's mandate should be carried out?\nGREENBERGER: I think those are very important definitions, but I also think that some of those words are open to some interpretation.\nAnd it's very important, not only to have the definitions, but to have strong interpretations of what those statutory definitions means.\nFELDT: I'll just add to that. And, again, I'm going to speak right now from the perspective of an on-the-ground provider, who's actually dealt with law enforcement at all the levels. I know less about the wording of the law and more about what it means in the real life of people who are trying to provide services.\nBut I do know this, and that is, that it has taken several years to actually hammer out an understanding that is now agreed upon to a reasonable extent and being able to be carried out to reasonable extent by law enforcement at all levels.\nBecause the U.S. Justice Department does not ever have the personnel to be able to enforce all of these laws uniformly across the country. It really does take using their bully pulpit and their leadership and their prioritizing of resources to make sure that their people will take the time and the energy and the leadership at the local level and the state level to bring together the various law enforcement agencies so that they are all working off of the same page. And so that they will use that, not just to apprehend a criminal once something terrible has happened, but rather to be able to prevent the violence and harassment and threats in the first place.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, I would strongly agree with that.\nNow, my interpretation--and I want to put this in the record--from what Senator Ashcroft said, is that he would fully enforce not only the word but the intent of the Freedom of Access to Clinics law. And that he would preserve the task force and that he would adequately fund it; \"provide it with resources,\" I believe was the language that he used. And I think that's very important to get in the record.\nMICHELMAN: Well, I'd just like to say, I agree completely it is important to get it in the record. And I appreciate the point that you are making.\nYou know, this law, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances law, has been challenged repeatedly by those who oppose a women's right to choose abortion. And universally throughout the country, courts have said this law is constitutional; that it does not prohibit freedom of expression, freedom of speech and the right of those who oppose to pray and speak out and march with signs, et cetera.\nBut it continues to be challenged. And the question I think a lot of us have is with John Ashcroft--Senator Ashcroft, at the helm of the Justice Department, what kind of interpretation will he give? Is this settled law? Or is it not settled law?\nYou raised, Senator, he said he would honor and respect and protect settled law. Well, many of the questions that have come up in the area of reproductive rights law and policy are, according to many, not quite settled. Some of the questions and some of the issues that come before us, many of them will be a matter of interpreting the law.\nAnd I--with all due respect to Senator Ashcroft, again his record of 25 years of unmitigated attempts, active participation in dismantling this law and the laws that protect women's reproductive rights, contraceptive access as well as abortion access, just speaks loudly to the view that it is implausible to think that he would as attorney general interpret--not just the enforcement part--but interpret the law that would guarantee women's rights. It's just implausible.\nI think there's a lot of room for an attorney general to question whether a law is really settled.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, I would be very happy if you--you see, I was very puzzled by the hearing because I saw a distinct change. And I accept and I recognize his point that he would enforce the law. And those of us that know him and who have worked with him have found that he's kept his word. And that's an important thing around this place, if somebody gives you their word that they keep it. And he has done that. Therefore, there is also a tendency to take him at face value.\nSo if you have any questions that you think we could further clarify this, because this is a very important area and I view this as coming, really, from the administration. And I think we need to know exactly what it is before we get hornswoggled.\nMICHELMAN: Senator Feinstein, I just wanted to underscore that that is a point that I was trying to make; that I don't question his word. I think there may be miscommunication about what he means when he says \"the law,\" and \"settled law,\" and what you or others may think he means about the law and which parts of the law are settled, and which parts when they come up in the future he might say, \"Well, that's an interpretation that isn't part of settled law.\"\nSo I think that he may be fully committed to enforcing the law as he sees it.\nFEINSTEIN: Well, would you give us the specific question on the parts of the law that may not be settled, and let us ask his view in writing, hopefully to get a prompt response before there is a vote?\nGREENBERGER: Yes, thank you, Senator Feinstein.\nMICHELMAN: And one, just final comment, the concern is that as--you know, if he is attorney general and he is, as Marcia said, you know, interpreting the law differently from the way we believe the law is now states--the protections of the law guarantees, it'll be too late, after he's attorney general, for the women of this country, as, you know, we find that his interpretation of the law, whether it's settled or not in all the aspects of the law that come up for us. It'll be too late for women then.\nGREENBERGER: Well, let me just respond. Just quickly.\nFEINSTEIN: Very quickly. We're a 50-50 body. The Judiciary Committee is the oversight committee. Senator Hatch is a man of great integrity. He has heard this entire discussion.\nI think if the attorney general were to depart from this, I would be the first one that would importune Senator Hatch to bring him up before the committee...\nHATCH: I can guarantee you of that.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHATCH: I can guarantee that you would be the first to call.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: I was going to finish your sentence for you, Orrin, because I know exactly what you meant.\nLEAHY: You weren't agreeing that easily.\nHATCH: And let me tell you, I know my place, too.\nGREENBERGER: Can a witness insert a quick point? And that is, much of what we're worried about can never often come to your attention, to our attention in order to hold an attorney general accountable. That's what's so important here. Much of it is prosecutorial discretion. Much of it is private advice. Much of it is a matter of such, I guess, personal interactions that we, the public and unfortunately the Senate, would never know.\nLEAHY: And that is a point that's been made a number of times in these hearings. And we will stop at that point.\nI emphasize, because Ms. Greenberger raises the subtleties of something like this, that we have to look at. And that's why you have to make a judgment call.\nThere will be the record--following our normal thing, the record will be available for additional written questions to Senator Ashcroft.\nThe members of the Republican Party have something they want to submit, through Senator Hatch. The Democratic Party submit through me. He understands that he is available to respond to those. That is our normal practice.\nI turn to the senator from Arizona, and obviously, he has some extra time because of this side.\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really want to direct my first remarks to Senator Feinstein, and then I'll talk to the panel for a moment.\nFirst of all, the issues that have been raised here and the process is exactly correct as you've described it, in my view. There will be disputes as long as there are lawyers. And unfortunately, there will--well, my wife might argue with that. I'm a lawyer, recovering lawyer namely.\nThere will always be lawyers. There will always be disputes about words, and there will never be an end to litigation. And those who are responsible for taking positions will, therefore, always have to make judgment calls. You all are absolutely correct on that.\nAnd therefore, you have to ask carefully: What kind of a person is it that is going to making those judgment calls? What kind of commitments has that person made?\nHaving acknowledged that, I believe that your area of concern here is misplaced. First of all, there's an assumption that John Ashcroft disagrees with a particular law that you're concerned with. He testified that he has no argument with that law.\nI personally have no argument with that law. And I sit here today committed to you--committed to--Senator Feinstein, you won't have to first of all contact Orrin Hatch. You can contact me, Senator Feinstein, because I am committed to the enforcement of the law in every appropriate respect. Senator Ashcroft said that he was, too. So there shouldn't be any question about whether he will do so.\nDoes he like what goes on in the clinics? No. But is it appropriate to protect peoples' rights to enter any place without undue harassment and violence? Yes. A clear constitutional principle that should be applied in many different situations. In fact, I have personally litigated it in labor disputes.\nIt's not an unfamiliar legal principle. So there should be no argument here about that irrespective of his and my concern about some of the things that go on inside of the clinics.\nIf there is, Senator Feinstein, you let me know, we'll march down and talk to John Ashcroft. And I simply don't believe this is going to be a problem.\nThere are some other things you are concerned about, and I can't make that same degree of commitment because I'm just not totally familiar with it. But I make that commitment to you, personally, and I think I can also speak for the attorney general to be, I hope.\nNow secondly, let me welcome you, particularly Gloria Feldt who also spent time in Arizona, a friend--at least I consider her a friend, notwithstanding some of our differences.\nAnd I also want to again welcome Colleen Campbell.\nYou came here on your own dollar as I understand; is that right, Colleen?\nCAMPBELL: Yes, it is.\nKYL: You testified before--I think it was four years ago when Senator Feinstein and I had a hearing. And at that time, you were just beginning your political career. And I wanted to go back over--you are...\nCAMPBELL: I just didn't tell anybody about it.\nKYL: But you're now--you've completed your second term as mayor of the city of San Juan Capistrano, as I understand. Congratulations on that.\nYou also said that you served as chairman of the Peace Officers' Standards and Training Commission and serve on the California Commission on Criminal Justice.\nSo you come before us not just as a personal victim of crime, but also as a representative of others; is that correct?\nCAMPBELL: I was authorized to represent the people that I told you about earlier. I guarantee everybody in San Juan Capistrano feels the same way I do, but I'm not sure about the police commission; didn't ask.\nKYL: Well, Mr. Chairman, I just ask at this point to submit in the record a list of all the several organizations. I know Senator Feinstein would be interested in these too, because--in fact, I'm sure she's familiar with many of them. They're all California victims' rights organizations.\nAnd one of the key questions--Senator Feinstein said to me yesterday, \"I think one of the questions we have to answer is will Senator Ashcroft follow the law.\" And that is a totally appropriate question. She and I have a particular concern about that, because despite the law, and sometimes despite their best intention, even judges haven't followed the law frequently with respect to victims' rights. There are other things that are of a higher priority.\nA Department of Justice study said that these laws are honored more in the breach than the observance. And I know--and unfortunately the current Department of Justice--here's where you get into this matter of discretion. We believe that the current Department of Justice has interpreted the law in such a way that it didn't feel it was in a position to help us. And as a result, it did not help us in getting our constitutional amendment to a vote on the Senate floor.\nNow I happen to think John Ashcroft will see it a different way, and he will help us to do that. And that's one of the reasons why I am so strongly committed to him, because I am so strongly committed to this issue.\nAnd I know from your testimony earlier, Colleen, that you said, \"If this weren't so important, I wouldn't have come,\" considering the recent death in your family and the other tragedies that you've had to endure. I think sometimes we do have to feel some passion about these things. We do have to insist that the law will be enforced. But it's not just some of the laws that have been talked about here; it's also the victims' rights laws and hopefully amendments that we've been talking about.\nJust a final point, since the red light just went on.\nLEAHY: He has extra time.\nKYL: I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman, but I also appreciate you've been trying to move things along.\nNot everybody on the dais right here was able to hear all of the testimony. And with the greatest respect to Harriet Woods, who's served her state with great distinction, it was a totally different John Ashcroft described by Jerry Hunter than it was described by you. And if Jerry Hunter could take just 30 seconds, for the benefit of those who weren't here, to describe the John Ashcroft he knows, I think that that would be beneficial, since you had your opportunity to do it a second time.\nHUNTER: Well, thank you, Senator Kyl.\nI'll just take a brief 30 seconds, as you said. But I would like to go back and just briefly mention, in response to a question that Senator Hatch asked about the St. Louis City Election Board, and I will briefly comment that when Governor Ashcroft was elected, as I indicated, he tried to appoint responsible people in all positions in state government.\nHe came up with a group of individuals, both white and black, to put on the St. Louis City Election Board. One of his first nominees for the St. Louis City Election Board was a black attorney in St. Louis.\nIn the Missouri system, when a governor is appointing an individual that requires Senate confirmation, you have to get the state senator of that district to introduce that individual. Governor Ashcroft's first black nominee for the St. Louis City Election Board was rejected by the black state senator, because that person did not come out of his organization.\nHe came up with a second black attorney in a different senatorial district to put on the St. Louis City Election Board. That second black attorney was rejected, because, again, the two black state senators did not feel that they could introduce those individuals, because they did not come out of their political organization.\nSo from the beginning, any efforts to make changes in the St. Louis City Election Board were forestalled because the state senators wanted people from their own organization. And even though John Ashcroft was the governor, they felt they should be able to name those individuals.\nAs I mentioned in my testimony, Governor Ashcroft's office called me shortly after his election and said he wanted to find good people and particularly of all races, and African-Americans to appoint to positions.\nAnd they asked me if I would work with him. I was practicing law in St. Louis at the time. And I worked with him for a year and a half prior to becoming the director of the Department of Labor.\nAnd Governor Ashcroft appointed, as I indicated, numerous blacks to state boards and commissions. He appointed myself as department director. He appointed the first blacks to serve as administrative law judges in the state of Missouri, both in St. Louis, Kansas City and in St. Louis County.\nUnfortunately, I think there is some testimony, obviously, which I don't agree with. Clearly, Governor Ashcroft had certain standards. He wanted people who could think on their own, who didn't have to call the ward leader and ask the ward leader how they should vote on issues. And I think that's one of the difference that I saw when Governor Ashcroft made appointments prior to that.\nThe other thing I do want to just briefly mention and I'll stop here, there was a reference--and I think my good friend, Ms. Woods, indicated it. And I don't want to make this too political--about how out-state Missouri would not want to fund education in the urban area St. Louis City--St. Louis and Kansas City.\nAnd I think in just in this past election, our current governor, who was running against Congressman Jim Talent, was running ads in our state, Missouri, saying that Congressman Talent was going to take all the education money from rural Missouri and give it to the rich St. Louis County school districts.\nAnd I heard those ads as I travelled throughout the state of Missouri. So I think that should be on the record, because, clearly, I thought that was unfortunate. It played to the suspicions that people in out-state of Missouri have of St. Louis. And that ad, clearly, was run to damage Congressman Jim Talent.\nLEAHY: I should note--I've noted a couple times during these hearings, but we get some inquiries from the press and sometimes C-SPAN and others. They've noticed that some senators have been in and out of this hearing. It's not because there is any lack of interest on either the Republican or Democratic side, but we have several nominations going on at the same time.\nI see the senator from New Hampshire, for example, has had a nomination hearing. Senator Feinstein, Senator Cantwell have been in Energy all day today.\nSenator Biden and Senator Kennedy--actually, Senator Hatch and I have had to miss some committees we're on because we're doing this.\nBut just so that people understand and all the witnesses statements all wanting to be heard, all our staffs are here for all this; senators are in that not unusual circumstance of having to be four places at once.\nFor example, I'm on the Agriculture Committee. President-elect Bush has nominated, from California, Ms. Campbell, Ann Veneman to be secretary of agriculture. I wanted very much to be there today to applaud President-elect Bush for that appointment. I knew Ms. Veneman when she was deputy secretary of agriculture. I think it was an excellent choice. I think Californians probably feel that way. I'll think there will be unanimous support from Republicans and Democrats from California.\nBut that's just an example of what's going on. I just wanted to put that on the record so people would fully understand.\nSenator Feingold?\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, let me thank all of the witnesses and especially Ms. Campbell for coming here after personal tragedy.\nI'll make a couple of comments, general points, before I ask a question. First, I want to commend the chairman for how he's arranged and handled this morning's testimony.\nThe disagreement over the confirmation of Judge Ronnie White was controversial, potentially very divisive. And I hope that everyone on the committee could now agree that both sides were treated fairly, given ample time to discuss their positions, and, most importantly, that both sides had those positions aired with dignity.\nAnd, I, again, thank the chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much.\nFEINGOLD: Second, I want to say again to the witnesses, some of whom have already testified before some who are testifying now. As I said in my opening statement, that I think the efforts that are being made to raise questions about this nomination are entirely appropriate. This is a highly controversial nomination. I'm glad the scrutiny is taking place, because I believe these issues have to be debated.\nIf nothing else, if Senator Ashcroft is confirmed, he will be more aware of the heavy burden he bears to convince all of the American people that he'll be fair and even-handed and work for all their all interests. And even though this is a difficult and grueling process, I don't think there's anything wrong for that kind of scrutiny. In fact, given the tough issues that this committee takes on and that an attorney general takes on, I can't think of a place where it's more appropriate.\nLet me ask, Ms. Feldt, Ms. Greenberger and Ms. Michelman a question, after making a couple of comments. I agree with Senator Feinstein and just about everybody else that we were struck with the strength of Senator Ashcroft's comments about enforcing the law, probably a little stronger than many of us would have expected with regard to Roe v. Wade. And I think it's going to be difficult for him to parse his words if he becomes attorney general.\nI would expect him, as some of the Republican members have indicated here, to live up to the spirit, not just the letter of the law. And I think that's exactly what the three of you are trying to address; that it will not be sufficient to simply somehow point to a few words in Roe v. Wade and use an interpretation that will completely undercut the right to choose.\nSo in that spirit, I would like you to say a little bit more about your concerns with the nomination. As you know, I've made this clear, I'm not very persuaded when you tell me about his votes and his vetoes. I don't buy that as reason to not put somebody in a position. What is more central, as Senator Schumer has well-said, is whether he can turn the spigot off, whether he'll enforce the law.\nAnd you've talked about at least two areas that relate to this, the position or interpretation he may take or if he were the solicitor general on interpretations for the Constitution. Another is, literally, what would be done in terms of enforcing the law.\nAnd then, third, and I think you've already touched on it, but I'd like each of you to talk more about it, is his role as an administrator, in terms of personnel and budgets and resources. What concerns would you have in terms of the choice issue with regard to Attorney General Ashcroft, if he becomes attorney general, in terms of the administrative role?\nWe'll start with Ms. Michelman.\nMICHELMAN: Well, my number one concern, of course, is that as an administrator, as a leader, the attorney general sets the tone, establishes the values and the principles by which the Justice Department carries out its duties. And with all due respect again to Senator Ashcroft, you've heard two days of testimony. It strains a bit of credulity, I think, to hear two days of testimony against 25 years--25 years--of not just passive opposition, but active participation in trying to undo a fundamental constitutional right of women that took us a century to achieve. And it has taken many forms.\nSo my first concern would be the values and the principles he brings, the leadership he brings, and what values he wants the Justice Department to uphold.\nThe second is, what kind of people is he going to select? And if those values and those views and those principles are hostile to the integrity of women and to our established constitutional rights, it seems to me his selection of people who work for him will be informed by those views, and therefore we'll have more people in the Justice Department who will join with him in his interpretation of the law as it relates to reproductive rights.\nHis priorities--we've already talked about that a lot; what kind of priorities he will bring to bear for the Justice Department. I mean, you can, you know how it is as a manager, as an administrator, you have to establish goals--you can't do everything, you've got to establish your goals and your priorities. Is he going to put the full force of the Justice Department behind enforcing all of the laws that protect women's constitutional rights of freedom of choice?\nI just think there are so many ways that as the attorney general he will--so many ways, a myriad of ways, some of which we've elaborated, some of which we haven't even touched on, some of which, as Marcia said earlier, are yet unknown or we won't even know about, that he will have an influence on the future of a woman's right to choose, and the laws that protect and guard our constitutional rights.\nAnd the attorney general is a prominent Cabinet member. He's not, you know--it's, sort of, much more important, in terms of women's rights, than almost any--maybe the secretary of HHS. But the attorney general has a profound impact on the direction of the Justice Department, the influence on the president, and how interpretation of the law and even federal legislation will be carried out.\nSo I also think, you know, we do have the matter of what cases the United States will argue before the Supreme Court.\nFEINGOLD: Actually, I'm just trying to get at the administrative piece.\nMICHELMAN: Well, that's an administrative piece, that's a decision-making...\nFEINGOLD: I was trying to distinguish that from other things because I...\nMICHELMAN: Yes, OK, all right. Let me let others comment on that very question.\nFEINGOLD: Ms. Feldt? Thank you very much.\nFELDT: Let me try to add to that and first say that I agree with what Kate said, though I won't repeat any of that. And I was listening very carefully to Senator Kyl in the exchange with Senator Feinstein. And I know that this question of Mr. Ashcroft is a man of his word is a very important one. And this does speak, Senator Feingold, I think to how I think he might handle the administrative elements of what he has to do.\nSo, I looked back at his record to, sort of, look at how did he handle some things as attorney general in Missouri. And I have to say that it is precisely because I think Ashcroft is a man of his word that I fear what he might do as attorney general of the United States.\nWhen he was the attorney general in Missouri, he did, as Marcia has already mentioned, take very aggressive stances. That means that he did use resources. He did prioritize the use of resources and budgets and personnel and research and all of the things that go into it. He took a very aggressive approach, even to the point of testifying in Congress in support of that human life amendment that would have banned all abortions. That's not a usual step. I mean, that is an unusual and an unusually aggressive step and an application of resources, and it speaks to an example of what he might do.\nSecondly, because of some of the other work that he had done in shaping the state laws of Missouri, he ended up with quite a full plate of litigation. For example, Planned Parenthood v. Ashcroft that also dealt with some of the limitations that he wanted to see on the right to choose abortion.\nKind of moving to another arena, in terms of the school desegregation litigation, he was willing to apply an immense amount of resources and personnel and energy to fighting the school desegregation process. And the district court had ordered the state and the city board of education, as you probably know, to submit voluntary plans to desegregate, and he repeatedly delayed doing that.\nFEINGOLD: By taking your answer--your concern is that the reverse was, sort of, happening here; that he would shut off the enforcement.\nFELDT: I am not talking just about the enforcement, it's the administrative...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFEINGOLD: Or the administrative resources--he would shut off the resources that would be pursuant to protecting the right to choose.\nFELDT: I think that there are big questions about that. And there are even bigger questions about the use of resources to find ways that cases could be brought...\nFEINGOLD: I understand.\nFELDT: ... that cases could be shaped, that legislation could be shaped. And when he told the Missouri Citizens for Life that he would stop at nothing until there is a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, I take him at his word. And I do not think John Ashcroft should be attorney general of the United States where he would have the ultimate ability to be able to shape that very act.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you.\nMs. Greenberger?\nGREENBERGER: Yes, Senator Feingold, I wanted just to add some things that I'm not sure time had allowed us to get to before on this. And it's a very important question that you asked. And I know you asked it in the context of choice, but actually I know that your commitment to women's rights and to fighting discrimination is broad, and I'd like to try to include that if that's responsive to your questions.\nFirst of all, let me say with respect to administration, personnel, budget, resources, in Senator Ashcroft's record in the choices of how he has allocated his budget priorities, we've heard comments, but I'm not sure that you were there when I mentioned earlier in the context of vetoes, one of the vetoes I talked about was picking out, through a line-item veto, funding for domestic violence that the Missouri state legislature had appropriated.\nAnd they were very small sums, actually, so it was very instructive to imagine a governor at the time finding and striking those specific, quite small amounts out, when there was really...\nFEINGOLD: So you're suggesting he'd build his power as an administrator in the Justice Department in a similar manner that he used his line-item veto as governor of Missouri?\nGREENBERGER: What I'm suggesting that that demonstrates, because the domestic violence program is within his purview as an administrator and it is of central importance to the safety of women, and nobody could be moved more than I, sitting next to Ms. Campbell, about how much--we've been holding each other's hand for this entire testimony--how much we want to avoid violence and victims, men or women, let alone children. For those of us who are mothers, there's nothing more horrifying than that.\nAnd the Violence Against Women Program that Senator Ashcroft would be administrating, with so many discretionary judgments he would make about where that money would go within the line item--often it is a line item--how much it would go for this part of the Justice Department or another part is something that would be difficult to review. And his past actions on that administrative judgment is clear.\nI want to also talk about...\nLEAHY: Ms. Greenberger?\nGREENBERGER: Yes? Sorry.\nLEAHY: I'm going to have to--we're going to give everybody a chance to add to their testimony and submit things for the record. I'll let you complete your thought, but then we're really going to move on, out of fairness to both sides here.\nGREENBERGER: Well, one other thing, quickly, I just did want to add is there is a lot of discretion with respect to laws that prohibit discrimination in employment, in education, central to women. And we saw, again, a major shift, a concrete shift, in 1981. And I wanted to give some statistics if I could that I haven't to mention involving disability discrimination, where suits went from 29 in 1980 to zero in 1981, three over the next three years. And I could go on, but that is some of the concrete concerns as an administrator.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you.\nHATCH: Just one comment. Ms. Greenberger, you know, as the prime author, along with Senator Biden of Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act, I can tell you on our side John Ashcroft was one of the more sensitive people working on that with us. And in all honesty, a number of the provisions that are in that bill came from Senator Ashcroft. So I think it may be not fair to give him, you know, to ignore the credit that he deserves in that area.\nI've been an active participant in that since the first passage of that bill. And a lot of people don't realize what our side does sometimes. But he played a significant role in that.\nGREENBERGER: Senator Hatch, I know you have. And I remember, over many years, how you've come to support women, lady miners, I remember, in Utah, and child care and many other important things.\nBut I wanted to go back to my point: Authorizing and reauthorizing that bill is a very different matter than appropriating funding for those programs, and that's why I really wanted to focus on the funding issue.\nHATCH: My point is that he is sensitive to these issues. And I think he'll do a very good job. And I intent to see that he does.\nSo I wouldn't worry too much, if I were you, because you have both a sincere man who's worked on it diligently, but you also have people up here, Senator Biden and Senator Hatch, who are going make sure that that's work very well.\nLEAHY: The very patient, senior senator from Ohio?\nDEWINE: Mr. Chairman, you keep on insisting on calling me the senior senator here.\nLEAHY: You are the senior senator.\nDEWINE: You make me feel old.\nLEAHY: You're not the senior senator?\nDEWINE: In service, that's correct.\nLEAHY: Well, that's what I mean.\nDEWINE: I appreciate it.\nLEAHY: But what makes it worse, the first week after I became the senior senator from Vermont--I was about 10 years younger than I am now--to get introduced that with great pride we introduce Vermont's senior citizen.\nDEWINE: Senior citizen. Well, at least you...\nLEAHY: I never wanted to...\nDEWINE: At least you didn't do that, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Well, I guess I'm getting close.\nLet me thank our panel for your patience and your testimony. I want to thank all of you for coming in today in this very important hearing.\nMayor Campbell, thank you for coming in. As other senators have said, we know this has not been easy, this has been difficult. But as you said, it's important. And we appreciate you being in here and we appreciate you testifying, not only for yourself, but for different victims' groups and for victims of crime.\nI must tell you that John Ashcroft, in my experience, has been someone who brings a real passion to the issue of victims' rights. Politicians always talk about victims, that's very easy to do. It has not always been really, though, fashionable to back up your words with actions. And it's been my experience that John has done that. And it's been my experience that John truly brings, when you talk to him--because I have--about this--and I know, as you have as well--you just see the passion that he brings to this. And I think it goes to his empathy and his understanding and the fact that he has dealt with many victims as many of us have.\nAnd when you talk with victims and understand, as the chairman has, you're a prosecutor or if you're an attorney general, I think you see that up close and personal, and you really understand it.\nSo I just want to give my own comment about that. And I appreciate it. And I think that John just brings an unbelievable passion to this cause. And I think that he will be the advocate, as attorney general, for the victims of crime in this country. He's done that in the United States Senate, he did it as attorney general, he did it as governor and I expected that he will do that as attorney general of our country.\nJohn--and I don't know if this, Mr. Chairman, has been mentioned before, but one of the areas that John worked on and brings a passion to is in the area of missing children. There's a quote that I'd like to put in the record from Steve McBride (ph), executive director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children branch in Kansas City. A brief quote: \"John Ashcroft's ground-breaking initiative as governor and his efforts in the Senate to provide the necessary resources to find missing children have had a wonderful effect. Since he formed the first regional agreement with five governors, the recovery rate in missing children cases has increased from 60 percent to 94 percent,\" end of quote.\nAnd as has already been mentioned, John was presented with a Congressional Leadership Award by the National Center for Victims of Crime, quote, \"for leadership that expands national discussion about crime and victimization issues to include non-violent crime and its victims.\" He secured funding for $800,000 for the National Victim Rights Hotline in 1999, helped secure $100 million in increased funding to combat violence against women, helped to enact legislation increasing penalties for those who purposely defraud seniors with telemarketing scams.\nAnd we could go on and on, but I think, Mr. Chairman, it is a record that John can be very proud of. But more important than that, I think it's a very good indication of what type priority John will have as attorney general of the United States.\nWe've seen a tremendous change in the way we deal with victims in this country. I started as a county prosecuting attorney in 1976, in my home county in southwestern Ohio, Greene County. And quite candidly, the crime victim agenda just wasn't there. We tried to help the victims. We did it on an informal basis. We worked with them as prosecutors and police, and tried to make everyone sensitive, but there were people who frankly fell through the cracks, literally, and we just didn't get to them because we didn't have any formalized programs.\nToday, what we see in this country, as you know, although that still happens and sometimes victims are not treated correctly and we have to work on that, and fight about that and fight for that, but we are doing as a country I think, better, and we are getting some systems in place. We're doing it at the local prosecutors' offices, we're doing it in state attorney general's offices, we're doing it not only with crime victim compensation in some states, many states, but with very, very formalized programs. And the federal government plays and must continue to play a major role in this, a major role with funding. And this is an area where I just have every, every confidence that this is going to be a man who will make us very, very proud as attorney general.\nAnd so, Ms. Campbell, thank you for coming in.\nMr. Chairman, I won't take any more time. I appreciate the chair's courtesy. And I again thank all the members of the panel.\nLEAHY: I understand you are submitting something for the record there, too.\nYou submitted something for the record too or you just read it for the record?\nDEWINE: No, I just read it right in.\nLEAHY: OK.\nThe senior senator from New York?\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank all of the panel. I know it's been a long day.\nI guess, my first question that I'd like to ask of both Ms. Feldt and Ms. Michelman is about a law that's important to me, the FACE law, which I authored when I was in the House.\nAnd, first, I wanted to clarify the record, because it hasn't been. On that FACE law, we did have an amendment in the bankruptcy bill which would prevent those who did violence and threats of violence against clinics from not to hide behind the false shield of bankruptcy to avoid the consequences of their actions. What we found was the FACE law was remarkably successful. Before the law, a large percentage of the clinics in America had been closed down--the family planning clinics--by blockades, by threats, and the FACE law gave the clinics the right to sue and it was remarkably successful.\nUnfortunately, some of those sued, then decided to use bankruptcy. The most notorious case was that of the Nuremberg files, where the people who put these together had the names and addresses of doctors who performed abortions on the screen. When one died they were--when one was killed, they were taken off; when one was injured, they were grayed over.\nAnd the clinic in Portland, Oregon, had been targeted, one of the clinics by this group, sued. I think there were 12 defendants. They won. They won a large judgment. And then each defendant went back to their home state and declared bankruptcy, making it extremely difficult for a poor little clinic to go around the country and follow them down.\nSo this law, the idea was you shouldn't--it was modeled on a law we used against drunk drivers. Same thing for someone who had hurt somebody, in terms of drunk driving would be sued and declared bankruptcy, and we said, \"You couldn't use bankruptcy,\" then and so we did the same thing here.\nSenator Ashcroft, it is true, as many of my colleagues have noted, voted on the floor to support that amendment. However, what they have neglected and he neglected to mention, is that he had voted against it in committee. And actually on the floor, it looked like it was going to be a tough fight to win it.\nAl Gore, who was then both vice president and candidate for president, came back from wherever he was because it looked like it might be a tie vote.\nAnd at that point, at least the newspapers reported, maybe some would dispute it--that Senator Lott urged his colleagues to vote the other way so that Gore wouldn't have the drama of breaking the tie and urged a lot of his colleagues to vote the other way. It passed 80 to 20. We've never had such a pro-choice victory on the floor of the Senate, at least in the two years I've been here.\nAnd Senator Ashcroft did vote the other way. But he had voted previously, maybe a couple of weeks or a month or two before, against the bill in committee.\nBut, my question is, since one of the most important functions of an attorney general, at least in the area of women's reproductive rights, is to implement the FACE law and support the clinics--of course, prevent the clinics from being shut down by violence or threat of violence--what do you think will happen if the FACE law is not aggressively pursued? If the task forces that are in place--I was glad to hear Senator Ashcroft, in response to a question from my colleague from California, say that he would keep these task forces in place, that he would fund them--I think his word was--adequately.\nBut what would happen if they were not, if the Justice Department played a less forward role in protecting those clinics? And maybe I'll call on Ms. Feldt and Ms. Michelman to answer that one.\nFELDT: Sure. Thank you, Senator Schumer. I guess to put that in perspective, the first thing I should is simply review what happened before FACE, because that might be the best way for us to think about what might happen if it weren't appropriately enforced.\nThe very good news is that since the passage of FACE in 1994, there has been, really, a precipitous fall in, really, all of the major categories of violence against and criminal acts perpetrated against health centers compared to the five years before that.\nThe number of murders of medical staff dropped 40 percent. Attempted murders fell by 36 percent. Arson dropped by 58 percent. Attempted arson and bombing fell by 50 percent. And incidents of harassment, disruption and blockades also showed a decline.\nIn my oral testimony earlier today, I talked about what it felt like, as a provider, to be personally harassed, vilified, death threats, bomb threats--you name it, I have probably dealt with it.\nAs I began to think about the answer to the question, though--and I think all we have to do is look at how it was before and get a picture of what it might be like after if, in fact, it is not properly funded and not properly supported, and most importantly, not properly given the bully pulpit and the leadership in addition to the resources, because it really does require that.\nAs I thought about my answer, I began to have this feeling of outrage that we should even have to talk about the need for such a law. It is truly outrageous to think that health care providers, that women seeking health care, that those of us who believe with all our hearts and souls that women must be able to control their own fertility if they are going to be able to enjoy any kind of equality in this world, have to even think about the necessity for such a law.\nI apologize for getting on that little soap box, but I must say that I see the enforcement of FACE as being an immensely important issue. But the much larger issue even than that is the whole question of the legality and the social support for a woman's ability to determine the course of her own life. Thank you.\nSCHUMER: Want to add something? My time is up.\nMICHELMAN: Just a quick addition to Gloria's, I think, very fine response. Since FACE was enacted in '94, the Department of Justice has obtained convictions of 56 individuals in 37 criminal prosecutions for violation of the law.\nNow as of this January, the Department of Justice has 53 remaining open investigations under FACE and related statutes. So, the question is, what do we fear, not only near the reality of threats to women and health care professionals, and to their lives, if it's not enforced, but will the attorney general continue with these investigations with great vigor and commitment?\nAgain, this goes to establishing priorities and goals. And we respectfully suggest that it's hard to believe that there will be great weight brought to this, given Senator Ashcroft's long record of opposition to a woman's right to choose.\nSCHUMER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions?\nSESSIONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Schumer, I guess, as I recall the facts on the FACE legislation, Senator Grassley, who's a proud sponsor, and I, in committee, opposed this amendment--this bankruptcy amendment on bankrupting against these--any judgments, because we believed it was inconsistent and unprincipled targeting of one simple group.\nAnd we discussed options and that kind of thing. And we saw it as a poison pill.\nI think most people who supported the bankruptcy bill voted with us in the committee. But on the floor, Senator Ashcroft did choose to support it, much to my surprise, because I felt like it was, in fact, a targeting of one kind of protest, but there was a refusal on the part of the sponsors of that to be willing to cover people who blockaded work sites or things of that nature.\nSo that's, kind of, the inside ballgame story of that. I don't think it reflect a lack of integrity on this part. Certainly, he enforced a similar FACE law in Missouri, and as I understand, lectured some abortion protesters about the need to follow the law. And that's certainly been his career and commitment, I believe.\nAnd on the abortion question, it's been suggested that he had--sometime ago, did not believe Roe was wrongfully decided. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, when he was confirmed, testified he would not hesitate to ask the court to overrule it. Attorney General Barr, both of whom I served under, said that he thought Roe was wrongfully decided. He'd made some commitments on Roe v. Wade I think are quite significant and should be comforting to you.\nMr. Susman, you used the phrase, I believe, \"he fought against court-ordered desegregation plans,\" in your phrase. I think that's an accurate description of what went on in St. Louis. I do not believe he should be characterized as having fought desegregation. That has upset me. And Senator Kyl has raised that point. I think that was an accurate legal description of what went on.\nMr. Robertson, you at least some of this period, I believe, were in the attorney general's office. This St. Louis plan involved a settlement of one school system's problems, is that right, or two? Was it one?\nROBERTSON: Well, the settlement that the attorney general's office ultimately challenged and continued to challenge was a voluntary settlement between school districts in the suburban part that had not been actually found guilty, and they invited the state to pay for it so that they would be absolved of that responsibility.\nSESSIONS: Well, Senator Smith and I have been working on a charity we'd like to see funded, and we've agreed it ought to be funded and we're going to ask Senator Kennedy to pay for it, I guess, or Senator Leahy, since he's here.\nBasically, the people of Missouri were being asked to pay for a school system in the St. Louis area; all the people of Missouri, is that correct?\nROBERTSON: That's correct.\nSESSIONS: And the attorney general is a lawyer for all the people; is that correct?\nROBERTSON: That's correct. And the state was a defendant in the lawsuit and the law requires the attorney general to defend the state.\nAnd I think it's important to make another point. And that is, that we--every year we're involved in budget negotiations to fund this plan. And that every year we only challenge those things about which we could not agree. To characterize this as being standing in the steps or the doorway of a schoolhouse by then-Attorney General Ashcroft I think is to mischaracterize what happened.\nFurther, his concern was the concern expressed by Representative Gephardt at the time that, \"We're not helping children here, we're just moving them around.\" And as Representative Gephardt went on at that point to sponsor an amendment to ban busing in the United States Constitution.\nSESSIONS: This is the minority leader in the House of Representatives?\nROBERTSON: And reported in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\nSESSIONS: He agreed with Senator Ashcroft on this desegregation court plan, basically, or opposed it also?\nROBERTSON: Well, he did then. I'm not sure he would now.\nSESSIONS: Well, I think that's significant. I think we ought to know that. I'm glad to hear that.\nGo ahead.\nROBERTSON: Well, we did what we thought was appropriate under the law to attempt, not only to help the children, but to protect the taxpayers. There was never a conversation, and I was involved in many of them, in which there was any statement by John Ashcroft that could be interpreted as, \"We're going to stop integrating schools.\"\nIt was the plan that was being imposed that was the problem, not the end that was being sought.\nSESSIONS: Would you offer for the record, the article that shows that minority leader of the House, Mr. Gephardt, agreed with Senator Ashcroft that this was not a good plan for children in the St. Louis area?\nROBERTSON: I'd be pleased to do that if the senator would like for me to.\nSESSIONS: And I'd like to talk about this other one, this Kansas City desegregation case. Isn't it, in fact, perhaps the most notorious court order in the history of the United States? Isn't that the one in which the federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, ordered a duly elected commission to raise taxes?\nROBERTSON: I might want to fight with you over the word notorious. But it was, in fact, a very extensive...\nSESSIONS: The \"taxation without representation\" phrase was heard a lot in America by people concerned about it.\nROBERTSON: That's correct.\nSESSIONS: Federal judges are unelected, have lifetime appointments and are unaccountable to the people. I do not believe they should be in the business of raising taxes.\nROBERTSON: Well, ultimately, I think the United States Supreme Court agreed with you on that question.\nSESSIONS: Well, in this Kansas City case, correct me if I'm wrong, the federal judge ordered, among other expenditures, an eight-lane, 50-meter swimming pool, better than any swimming pool in any college in the state of Missouri, a 300-seat Greek amphitheater, a stage framed by white columns, a planetarium, greenhouses, dust-free diesel mechanic shop, broadcast cable, radio, TV studios, school animal rooms--I'm not sure what that is...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... private nature trails, overseas trips for students, model United Nations with foreign language translation.\nThe price tag for these being--eventually reached, I understand, $1.7 billion. Is that consistent with your recollection on the case that Attorney General Ashcroft resisted?\nROBERTSON: Well, that is an accurate rendition as I understand it, but I think I'd want to make the further point that never a single time did Attorney General Ashcroft direct the state not to pay money that had been ordered by the court, even when that order was being appealed.\nSESSIONS: Now, do you personally have to approach...\nLEAHY: I know that some of the witnesses are going to have to lead, and just so people know, after Senator Durbin and Senator Smith ask questions, we will dismiss this panel.\n(UNKNOWN): Forgive me for interrupting. Let me offer my apologies, but I was supposed to be in California today, and the last stage out of Dodge is 5:30, and if I don't leave, I won't make it.\nLEAHY: Go. As my mother's family say, a diomo (ph). In fact, if anybody else is in that same situation, feel free.\nSESSIONS: Just one yes or no question for Mr. Robertson: Even after all of these expenditures, is it accurate that Missouri stripped the school district of its accreditation in 1999? Even after all of this?\nROBERTSON: The tragedy, Senator, is all of this money results in lower test scores and greater minority concentration in the school district.\nSESSIONS: We can do better. There are better ways to do business than the way it was done in Missouri.\nLEAHY: And, certainly--I mean I'm here for the committee. We can have further rounds on this. But if we want to finish these hearings before the inaugural at noon on Saturday...\nSESSIONS: Well, I've gone over a lot less than the last two on this side of aisle went on.\nLEAHY: I understand. Well, no--and I'm not cutting off the senator. If the senator wants to have another round, we'll have another round.\nHATCH: I suggest that we enforce the five-minute rule, and let's do it unwaveringly.\nLEAHY: We have--I see Senator Brownback is back. The senator has not had his questions, so it will be Senator Durbin, Senator Brownback, Senator Smith. We will then, Senator Hatch and I--we'll break and Senator Hatch and I will invite--we'll break for five minutes--and Senator Hatch and I will invite all senators from both sides out back to talk about seeing which ones we can finish tonight and what time we'll start in the morning.\nSenator Durbin?\nDURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm also heartened that there's a reminder to enforce the five-minute rule by the time it gets down to this end of the table.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: What is it, 10 minutes here, five minutes there?\n(LAUGHTER)\nDURBIN: But I'm also reminded of Muriel Humphrey's admonition to Hubert Humphrey that a speech does not have to be eternal to be immortal.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSo, I will try to be brief. And first, let me thank Ms. Campbell. All of the witnesses made a sacrifice to be here. You made a special sacrifice, and thank you for being here. It makes a big difference; we really appreciate that.\nI'd like to ask some of the panelists here and Ms. Greenberger, Ms. Feldt, Ms. Michelman,and Ms. Woods as well; most of you heard the testimony of Senator Ashcroft relative to what is settled law.\nI think that's going to become a very important phrase should John Ashcroft become attorney general. And I found it interesting in his opening statement that he said he believed Roe v. Wade and Casey were settled law in the land. And yet, when Senator Schumer and I tried to follow up on the whole question of the partial birth abortion ban, to ask him what that meant, I'm not certain we received a direct answer.\nI think we understand that most Americans believe that third-term late abortions should be rare and confined strictly to those cases where a woman's life or health are in jeopardy. We have debated this over and over in the Senate, and Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, who offers this regularly, has said he will not include the protection of a woman's health when it comes to these late abortions. And many of us have said that is an important element to include.\nWe have been criticized by some who say that we are insensitive, but that has been the case, that has been the vote, and that has been, I guess, the outcome until this case comes along the Nebraska statute. The Nebraska statute did not include an exception for the health of the mother in late abortions and was sent to the Supreme Court for a decision, and the Supreme Court, I thought, gave a very clear answer to the Nebraska statute; it threw it out, and said that under the Casey decision, you have to protect not only the life of the mother, but the health of the mother, unequivocally. They said the Nebraska statute didn't do that.\nThe point we tried to make yesterday and ask of Senator Ashcroft on this whole settled law concept is, what would you do with the Santorum bill if it came to you again, and didn't have the health protection provided by Casey, reiterated by the Supreme Court in Stenberg v. Carhart? And unfortunately, what seemed like an unequivocal answer in the beginning about what he would do as attorney general fell apart.\nWhen he was asked by Senator Schumer if he'd advise the president to veto such a bill, I'm not sure we got a straight answer. When I asked him whether or not a Santorum bill without the health protection came up before the Supreme Court, what he would do as attorney general, again he equivocated. That leaves me uncertain as to how this senator, who has been resolute in his opposition to a woman's right to choose throughout his public career, and has told us in the last 48 hours he's a different person in a different job with a different attitude, could fail to answer that basic question.\nDURBIN: Ms. Michelman, could you respond your view of his response yesterday?\nMICHELMAN: Well, I would offer that you raised a very critical challenge to Roe v. Wade, which are these bans on abortion procedures that you have dealt with, as a Senate; this Congress, indeed, has over the last five years.\nAnd that challenge that these procedures bans raises go to the very heart of Roe v. Wade. Not only did they not protect women's health by ensuring that exception, they also were written so vaguely and so--you known, in such a way that they would, in fact, criminalize many commonly used forms or many commonly used procedures from the earliest moments of pregnancy.\nAlso the ban did not follow and was not Constitution under Roe, because, again, it would cross trimester lines. I mean, the thing about Roe v. Wade was, it was a carefully balanced decision, recognizing, guaranteeing women a right to choose in the first two trimesters of pregnancy, without any government interference.\nIn the last trimester, Roe said, indeed, states may prohibit abortion, except there have to be exceptions for when a women's life is at risk and her health is at risk. These procedure bans that you are talking about, have not included those exceptions and have not made sure that these laws are constitutional under Roe.\nSo it seems to me that what Senator Ashcroft found himself doing was having difficulty when it comes right down to establishing that he will enforce the law. In the question of these cases he wasn't able to guarantee or even talk about the fact that these cases are a violation of what he considers established law. They were violations, they were attempts to overrule Roe, they were clearly unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has already said this. And he wasn't able--with the same force that he has been saying for two days, that he will uphold Roe, he wasn't able to see that case.\nSo I think it, again, just raises the question as to whether two days of testimony can offset and overturn 25 years.\nDURBIN: Thank you very much.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Smith?\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is it five minutes now, Mr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: We're trying. We're trying. Hope springs eternal at this end of the table.\nHATCH: It is five minutes, though.\nLEAHY: I'm going to let--for your side--I'm going to let Senator Hatch run the clock.\nHATCH: I refuse to handle the gavel.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSMITH: Don't start the clock, until you guys...\nLEAHY: You're right, go ahead. I'll make sure you get it.\nSMITH: Ms. Campbell, let me say what others have said to express my sympathies to you for what happened and for you to be here and sit through a debate on other matters, too. It's very difficult and my heart goes out to you. That's a terrible, terrible thing to have to experience.\nMs. Michelman, as you might expect, we have differences over this issue.\nAnd I guess--and I'm not going to debate it here, obviously--but I guess the only thing I would say is, aren't we really, in essence, conducting an extension of the campaign here? I'm assuming that your organization, the National Abortion Rights League, didn't support Governor Bush, and that's obvious. He won. Doesn't he have a right to pick his attorney general?\nMICHELMAN: Senator...\nSMITH: Please, not out of disrespect, but I do have a couple of other points.\nMICHELMAN: OK. Let me just say I think this threat to the constitutional right of women to freedom of choice is much too serious to relegate it to political--dismissing it by referencing the election.\nOf course we endorsed a pro-choice candidate. But we fully respect the president-elect's right to choose his Cabinet. And we fully expected him to choose a conservative nominee for attorney general, and, in fact, one who would oppose Roe v. Wade.\nThis is different. This candidate is way outside the mainstream of any kind of thinking--you know, in opposition to contraception. So there's much too much at stake. This is not about the past. This is about the future of a woman's right to choose. And that's why we so strongly oppose this nominee.\nSMITH: And I understand. I respect you for your views. There are those, though, that would say that in 1857, when Dred Scott was not allowed to sue in federal court because he was a slave and therefore property, they thought that was wrong. I'm not saying it's the same issue, obviously, but--or the Plessy v. Fergusson, that was the law of the land at one time and that had to be changed. There are those who respectfully would disagree.\nBut let me just see if I could focus on it this way. So if that is the disqualifier, again, I just would remind you, when Senator Hatch had the gavel when Janet Reno was confirmed--I could be wrong, correct me, Senator Hatch if I am--I don't recall whether it was--maybe there were requests made, but Senator Hatch did not have pro-life advocates here at the table and criticizing Janet Reno. I voted for Janet Reno, as did all of my colleagues, and I disagreed with her vehemently on this issue, because Bill Clinton won the election and, respectfully, I thought that he had the right to pick his attorney general. And I really believed that she would enforce the law of the land, no matter what it is.\nI think Senator Ashcroft--I know Senator Ashcroft will do likewise.\nBut, with respect, let me just see--I'm trying to figure out who is acceptable. William Rehnquist, who is the chief justice of the United States, if he had been asked to serve as attorney general, he's pro-life, he's voted that way. If he were asked by President Bush to be attorney general, would he be acceptable to you? Just yes or no, because I'm trying...\nMICHELMAN: Well, I think we're talking about Senator Ashcroft...\nSMITH: I know we're talking about, but I'm trying to understand the criteria--I'm trying to understand the criteria which you...\nMICHELMAN: The criteria, Senator, is about an attorney general whom Americans can count on to respect and defend and protect their established constitutional rights, and Senator Ashcroft is not that attorney general.\nSMITH: Well, Senator Ashcroft has had experience that many to this job have not had as attorney general. And with one or two notable exceptions, I think, was absolutely strictly adhering to the law. You can be an advocate, you're always an advocate in your heart, but there is a difference between advocating as a legislator and as Senator Ashcroft would legislate aggressively on what he believes, as you would, but as enforcer of the law, he has an obligation to do it. He took an oath to do just that.\nSo I'm just assuming that--Senator Hatch, is Senator Hatch qualified? He's a supporter of the human life amendment, would he be acceptable to you as the attorney general of the United States?\nI know I'm not, but I'm just curious about Senator Hatch.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLet me just point, with respect to all of my colleagues, some who I'm going to quote here, I'm trying to make a point is, I think you have to be fair and not extend--this is a pretty important nominee I respect. I understand that's a lifetime appointment. But, you know, we saw apologies down the table on the other side for Ronnie White. I didn't realize that one senator could apologize for another senator, but apparently that did.\nSo in that spirit, I'll apologize to Clarence Thomas and I'll apologize to Robert Bork for what the Senate did to them.\nBut let me just say why I think you get in trouble. Let me read a quote. \"Wanted or unwanted, I believe that human life, even in its earliest stages, has certain rights which must be recognized, including the right to be born. Once life has begun, no matter at what stage of growth, it is my belief that termination should not be decided merely by desire. When history looks back to this era, it should recognize this generation as one which cared about human beings enough to fulfill its responsibilities to its children from the very moment of conception.\"\nThat wasn't John Ashcroft who said that. That was Ted Kennedy who said that two years before Roe v. Wade in 1971. So, very interesting.\nSo I'm--I guess what I'm saying to you is--and we could go on and on. Byron White, who was the attorney--who worked under Robert Kennedy at the attorney general's office, appointed to the Supreme Court by John F. Kennedy; quote, \"I cannot accept the court's exercise of\"--this is in Roe--\"by interposing a constitutional barrier to make state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the unconstitutionally protected right to exterminate it.\"\nThe point is people change. People enforce the law regardless of their views. And John Ashcroft is going to be confirmed, and when he is and you look back on this period of time eight years ago--I know him well--you will find that he will enforce it. There are going to be times he's going to enforce it he wish he didn't have to, but he will.\nAnd that's the issue here. And I wish that we were not extending--and I say this respectfully--I think we are extending the campaign. None of this on this side that I know of made any effort to derail the Reno nomination or embarrass her in any way because of her views. And I think that's, frankly, the difference in this bipartisan--so-called go along, get along bipartisan Senate. That's really the difference as to the two sides on this issue.\nLEAHY: Senator Brownback?\nBROWNBACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank the panel for being here through a long day for everybody.\nI just want to make a couple brief points and recognize my limit of five minutes. And everybody starts getting antsy when I get up because I'm the only thing that stands between them and the door. So, it shortens things up.\nOne of the things that's been troubling to me is that it seems like that you're going at the nominee here and trying to paint him in an extreme light, when the issue is not the point of view that he has taken, which I think can be fairly categorized in many cases as quite mainstream, but really that what's it about here is whether he'll enforce the law.\nAnd then you try to, by extension, saying, \"OK, he's taking this political position, therefore that's how he will enforce the law.\" And I don't think that that's really a fair characterization.\nI realize you have differences of opinion with the nominee on the issues; partial birth abortion, you have differences of opinion with him on that. But I don't think you could put the nominee's position as extreme on partial birth abortion.\nHe voted for the Santorum bill--that's where I've got a poll here shows 73 percent of the American public is. Your organization opposed this bill on the partial birth abortion. And I think your group would be deemed more outside of the mainstream on that particular issue.\nOn parental notification, number of people, over 80 percent of the American population believes that parents should be notified if their underage daughter is having an abortion. Your organization has opposed that. The nominee says that parents should be notified.\nAnd then you use these sorts of other positions to say he's outside of the mainstream, you're in the mainstream. Therefore, he can't be trusted to enforce the law, not the position that he's taken.\nThe only overall point that I'm trying to make here is, is that you can take a lot of different positions from people and we can--let's look at the issue of partial birth abortion or if you wanted to look at parental notification of this, where the public is generally saying, \"We don't like partial birth abortion and we think parents should be notified.\" And you're outside of the mainstream on that. The nominee is within it. But that's irrelevant on both sides.\nThe issue is, he has stated that he will enforce the laws, that he will uphold the laws of this land, that he has done that in the past and that he will do that in the future. And so I don't think it's a fair characterization to try to paint, in one way off, a position. And, therefore, then pull it all the way around to say, \"This going to be how he will be as attorney general.\"\nI've noted that NARAL has opposed a number of nominees in the past: Justice Souter, Justice Rehnquist as chief justice, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, William Barr as attorney general. So I know that this is a consistent position that you've taken in the past, and I respect that consistency that you've been there.\nBut I don't think that this is a fair way to say that your attorney general will act extrapolating off of policy positions.\nSo I respect your willingness to do it, your desire to stand up and say so. I would just hope that we would look at what we're about here today, and that's not partial birth abortion, not debating parental notification, but whether or not this nominee will enforce the law and I don't think you can extract from a policy position that note.\nSo, Mr. Chairman, I realize it's late in the day for this, but I appreciate the opportunity to speak and thank all the panelists for being here and being willing to testify.\nLEAHY: Every senator has a right to be heard on this, no matter which side they're on. And I think the senators have realized the chair is trying to protect the right of each senator on each side, both sides of the aisle to have that time. And that's I've allowed extra time several times on both sides of the aisle.\nIf there are no further questions.\nBROWNBACK: Mr. Chairman, may I make a ten-second comment?\nLEAHY: Of course.\nBROWNBACK: One other item I neglected to mention was that on your scorecard in 1999, you gave a 0 to Senator Ashcroft. You also gave a 0 to Senator Breaux, and a 5 percent to Senator Reyes, which means under that criteria neither one of them would be qualified to be attorney general either.\nLEAHY: As soon as Governor and now President-elect, soon to be President, Bush nominates either Senator Breaux or Senator Reid to be attorney general, we'll get right to that issue.\nBROWNBACK: It will be very interesting to see where the opposition comes from.\nHATCH: Now, if I could add something, we're glad to see you back. It's been eight long years without you.\nLEAHY: That's very good.\nHATCH: You know, I've missed you.\nLEAHY: OK. Listen, be serious, nobody else got a question? If they do, or don't. Then we will recess for five minutes. Both parties will meet out back to decide where we go, how far we go tonight.\n(RECESS)\nHATCH: Let's have order.\nLEAHY: People understand, we'll start with this--this almost like the Durbin lament, when I see we get down towards the end, and we start saying, \"By golly, we're going to keep time.\" As Senator Durbin has pointed out to us, why didn't somebody think of that earlier before they got to him?\nWe're going to try and do that. We'll go through this panel. We're going to go until about 6:00--I say about because I'm obviously not going to cut somebody off at the middle of a question or testimony--and then start talking about tomorrow. We have to give up this room by around noon tomorrow because of various inaugural events.\nAnd Senator Hatch and I are determined to wrap this up. Because there are still questions that are being submitted in writing to Senator Ashcroft and others. We've got to give--in fairness to them, in fairness to Senator Ashcroft--we've have to give him time to complete the paperwork for the Senate that is required and also give him time to respond to the questions that will be asked.\nSo, did you want to add anything to that, Orrin?\nHATCH: No, I think we should try and finish--if we can move fast, we might be able to get this panel over by 6:00. Let's try.\nLEAHY: We'll do our best. On the other hand, I would also note for the record, everyone on this panel has been waiting very patiently for a considerable period of time. And I am not going to have anybody leave here feeling they did not have the chance to make their statement because of a clock.\nYou all have serious things to say. You all have a strong reason for being here.\nMr. Mason, we'll begin with you, sir.\nMASON: Thank you very much, Senator.\nA little, a brief commentary about my background, if you will. I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, under very difficult financial circumstances.\n(CROSSTALK)\nLEAHY: People are going in and out. We're going to have to ask those at the door--there's a lot of noise in the hall that filters in--Mr. Mason bring the microphone close to you. Start the clock back up.\nMASON: As I said, I wanted to give you a little bit about my background, because I want you to understand where I'm coming from, Senator, with respect to my comments. I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, in north Nashville under very difficult circumstances. I lived in New York City ages 10 to 15, the last two years in South Ozark (ph) Park, New York, in Queens.\nAnd it was while I was living there, I attended John Adams High School Annex. That area--South Ozark (ph) Park and Ozark (ph) Park, Queens--was experiencing a great deal of racial conflict at the time.\nI and a friend of mine, after school one day, in '71, were jumped on, quite frankly, by a white gang from Ozark (ph) Park. We were beat very severely. There was an argument between the gang leader and some other member of the gang about whether I should be stabbed or just--and you have my big, blank, blank, blank butt sit home. And while that argument was going on, a police car came up. And they ran away. And I survived it.\nI have seen racism in every respect and one can see it. I've been the victim of it professionally, academically. I've been the victim of it physically, in terms of being beat. I've been the victim of it verbally. I know it when I see it. I can smell it walking down the street.\nI'm here for one reason and one reason alone, that I strongly disagree with the implications that John D. Ashcroft is a racist. I have spent a great deal of time with that man, and I will elaborate.\nI graduated from the Washington University School of Law in 1983. And after that, I went to work for the Missouri attorney general's office. At that time John Ashcroft was the attorney general.\nIn my interview with him, we discussed our various backgrounds as young people. And I talked about my work in the political party, the Democratic political party.\nIn fact, Senator Kennedy, I mentioned to him an experience when you came to Vanderbilt in '76, and you spoke. And I was only about 100 feet in the cheering and screaming crowd. And it was quite an exceptional speech that you gave.\nAnd he talked about his background, working as a Republican in the Republican Party as a young person. Frankly, I thought I wasn't going to be hired after that, but I was hired. And I began employment in that ocean of whiteness that was described as the Jefferson City Office of the Missouri Attorney General.\nI found in that office nothing but support, warmth, commitment. I got good cases at all times. At no time was there every any suggestion that I was anything less than an appropriate person to represent the interest of the state of Missouri in all federal courts, all jurisdictions we went to, up to and including a case that I was able to work on for the U.S. Supreme Court that I had to give up the oral argument on, but I drafted the brief and the merits.\nThe senator and I formed a friendship based upon our mutual commitment to our lord and savior. We had lots of discussions about how I grew up, about how my grandmother raised me. And he developed an affinity for her; would often write her letters and send her copies of his albums--his gospel albums and he would sign things to her.\nAnd as time went on, I begin to get a real feel for this man and where his heart is. When the subject of Martin Luther King Day came up, I was there. And I recall that he issued the executive order to establish the first King Day, rather than wait for the legislature to do it. Because, as you may recall, some of you, when the Congress passed the holiday, they passed it at a time when the Missouri legislature may not have been able to have the first holiday contemporaneously with it. So he passed a King holiday by executive order. He said, in doing so, he wanted his children to grow up in a state that observed someone like Martin Luther King.\nI saw this commitment carry though, when I begin to work in the Republican Party. I worked heavily in both parties. I was a Jimmy Carter person and then worked for Bob Clement. And I went and did some work in the Republican Party, because of the friendship I developed with John Ashcroft.\nAnd what that work was, was I wrote a diversity platform policy for the Missouri Republican Party. I took it into Sedalia and all the small towns of Missouri. I took it to the Missouri Republican Party Convention in '88. It passed unanimously, and it passed under Ashcroft's watch.\nI noticed that it survived after I became a judge in both '92 and '96.\nThere was some discussion about black participation under the years of--when John Ashcroft was governor. While I was an attorney, after I left the Department of Corrections, I was their general counsel for a while, he appointed me to the stadium authority. It was the St. Louis Regional Athletic and Sports Complex Authority. It was our job to build a new stadium for our football team--$270 million project.\nMost of the votes on that commission were controlled by John Ashcroft. We made a commitment very early on that that program was going to have substantial black participation at all levels. I chaired the committee that hired the large number of black lawyers that worked on that project, members of the Mound City Bar. I watched as accountants and people who sold stocks and securities and carpenters and people engaged in construction management who were of color, who were black, came into that project.\nAnd that project came in on time, under budget, with the highest level of minority participation of any project of its size in Missouri's history. That was under John Ashcroft's watch. It's a monument of steel and stone that he is committed to participation. And no amount of rhetoric can dance around it. It is there. And I watched it happen. No one had to come to St. Louis and protest and stop the work in order for that to happen.\nSo I say all that to simply say this to you, Senator--and I will sum up because I see that red light. I would ask that this Senate avoid the politics of vengeance in making this decision, to forget how angry any of you may be about things that Senator Ashcroft may have done or said to people that you wanted to see appointed. And show America that you are prepared to engage in the politics of principle, that you will advise the president of the United States how the Justice Department should be run, what the priorities should be, how the laws should be enforced. And upon getting that advice, give your consent when you know that his nominee has committed to you that he will enforce all the laws of this country in equal measure, both spirit and letter.\nGive the president your consent. And that's what I'm here to say today. Thank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Judge. I appreciate your testimony.\nMr. Henderson, you are no stranger to this committee. You've appeared before us in many different issues. And we are always pleased to have you here. Go ahead, sir.\nHENDERSON: Well, thank you, Chairman Leahy, Senator Hatch and members of the committee. I'm Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\nThe Leadership Conference is the nation's oldest and most diverse coalition of civil and human rights organizations.\nI appreciate the opportunity to present to you the views of the Leadership Conference regarding the nomination of former Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney general of the United States. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights strenuously opposes the nomination of Senator Ashcroft to be attorney general.\nI report this judgment to you with great sadness. We did not seek this conflict, and we do not relish it. We are mindful of the calls for bipartisan cooperation that accompanied the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Bush and we had looked forward to working with the new president and his attorney general on a wide array of civil rights challenges facing the nation. We still do.\nHowever, the unexpected and disappointing selection of John Ashcroft compels our current position. It is hard to conceive of an attorney general nominee with more immoderate beliefs and a more abysmal civil rights record than former Senator Ashcroft. For over 30 years in public life, first in Missouri and then in Washington, John Ashcroft has been on the wrong side of virtually every issue of concern to the membership organizations of the Leadership Conference.\nIn reaching to the farthest degree of his political party to make this selection, President-elect Bush has displayed indifference to the sensitivities of African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, Americans with disabilities, gays and lesbians, the elderly and so many other Americans who are concerned about equal justice under law.\nWe acknowledge that a president is ordinarily entitled to deference in his choice of executive branch appointees, but the nomination of Senator Ashcroft to be attorney general overcomes that presumption for four reasons.\nFirst, this appointment occurs in a political context unprecedented in our nation's history. The Ashcroft nomination was announced less than two weeks after the extraordinarily close presidential election ended in an abrupt and discomforting manner.\nIt is no secret that Americans were aggrieved by the circumstances of the election, especially in the decisive state of Florida. It is often said that Dr. Martin Luther King gave up his life so that others would have the right to vote, but as we have learned last November, that even in the year 2000, some citizens are less firmly enfranchised than others. Investigations by the NAACP, the United States Commission on Civil Rights and other groups have exposed widespread suppression of the African-American vote in Florida and disparities in election technology that systematically disadvantaged voters in less affluent neighborhoods.\nIn the wake of this harrowing election, we might have expected the new president to reach out to the civil and human rights community by selecting, yes, a conservative, but an attorney general with nonpartisan stature and an unquestioned commitment to well-established principles of equal protection under law.\nAnd we might have expected the new administration to turn its attention immediately to the electoral reforms needed to assure Americans that in this democracy every vote counts.\nInstead, with the wounds of Florida still raw, the country finds itself in the midst of a divisive debate over the confirmation of John Ashcroft. Responsibility for this new schism unfortunately does not rest with the civil rights community and those who oppose Senator Ashcroft.\nNow, I do not here question in any way the legitimacy of the election results. But I must observe that the incoming president, we believe, and say so quite respectfully, lacks an electoral mandate to undertake the dramatic reconsideration of civil rights policy that this nomination implies.\nSecond in my list of four items, the deference due to an executive branch appointment does not end debate on this nomination, because of the unique role of the attorney general in our constitutional system. Now as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, the attorney general serves in a quasi-judicial function. He or she adjudicates legal disputes within the executive branch and renders advisory constitutional opinions upon which the president and Congress rely. He or she serves as the president's chief adviser on judicial nominations, which for all of us is an important responsibility, including nominations to the Supreme Court.\nFinally, the attorney general represents the United States in the Supreme Court through the solicitor general, an officer sometimes referred to as the tenth justice because of the special reliance the justices place on the solicitor to advise the court on the state of the law.\nThus, the attorney general is not merely the president's agent; not just another member of the president's team. The Justice Department enjoys a tradition of independence and a unique constitutional standing that should lead the Senate to grant less deference to the president's choice for attorney general than the deference due to the president's other Cabinet selections.\nChairman Leahy and others have taken note of Senator Ashcroft's unyielding opposition to the nominations of Bill Lann Lee as assistant attorney general for civil rights, Henry Foster and David Satcher for surgeon general, James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg. It might be argued that a senator who did not extend to President Clinton the deference due to executive branch appointments is not entitled to the benefits of such deference upon his own nomination.\nHowever, that is not our position. We disputed what has been called now the Ashcroft standard when it was applied to Mr. Lee, or Dr. Foster or Mr. Hormel. But, we will not apply it to Senator Ashcroft himself. Rather, we contend that the skepticism with which Senator Ashcroft unfairly approached these other nominations is, in fact, justified in the case of the attorney general.\nNow, I notice that my red light is on and so I need to summarize, and I'll try to do so very briefly.\nLet me say that there are numerous concerns that we have. Obviously, we have heard much testimony over the last two days from Senator Ashcroft himself, attesting to his willingness to enforce the law, to respect the great traditions of the Department of Justice and indeed we were pleased to hear that news and that information.\nHowever, when you examine the record, the totality of the record that Senator Ashcroft has established, first as attorney general in St. Louis, the cases that have been mentioned here including the school desegregation case that has been so noted, and other concerns, we believe do, in fact, require us to oppose him as a compelling matter of principle. And we hope indeed that the Senate will reject his nomination.\nThank you very much.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Henderson. I note that both you and Judge Mason went over just about exactly, almost the same thing.\nHENDERSON: I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: No, it's a difficult thing. You both have extremely important things to say. I mention that more just for--because I can see the clock, and Senator Hatch can see the clock, and the rest cannot see the exact time. And, unfortunately, it's the realities of a nomination hearing like this and try to get so much in.\nI suspect Pastor Rice would never want to have one of his sermons cut to five minutes, and I suspect your congregation wouldn't want you to. Pastor, go ahead.\nRICE: I think that may be debatable itself, but we'll do our best. Mr. Chairman and Senator Hatch, my name is Pastor Booker T. Rice and I've been a pastor in St. Louis, Missouri, since 1979 and am presently with the New Horizon Seventh Day Christian Church.\nI am here today at the request of the St. Louis Clergy Coalition, believed to be the largest and oldest organization of African-American ministers in the state of Missouri, and it's president, the Reverend Dr. Earl Nash Jr., to register our strong opposition to John Ashcroft's confirmation as attorney general of these United States of America.\nOur opposition centers primarily around, but not limited to the following reasons. First, Mr. Ashcroft made false and inflammatory charges against Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White. Mr. Ashcroft labeled this distinguished jurist as pro-criminal, dangerous liberal, and the most anti-capital punishment judge on the Missouri court. These labels fly in the face of the fact that in no way reflects the record of this distinguished judge.\nSecond, we oppose Mr. Ashcroft because of his consistent opposition to restrictions on handgun ownership and consistent support of what we call packing, or better known as carrying concealed weapons.\nThird, we oppose Mr. Ashcroft because of his insensitivity to the African-American community in general, and to the African-American community in Missouri, in particular.\nWe also oppose Mr. Ashcroft's extreme, unyielding position on a woman's right to choose.\nIt is my intention here today to expand on several of these points so that you may better understand why the appointment of John Ashcroft would be divisive and insulting to our community.\nTo characterize Judge White as pro-criminal makes a false assertion that the respected Judge is a supporter of criminal activities. We teach our children to set their sights on good role models, then pattern their life-long goals after those role models. Unfortunately, sometimes our children focus on what we perceive to be wrong role models, so we attempt to refocus or redirect them to those we believe the very best for our Missouri children. In our community, Judge White has become such a role model.\nImagine if you will our disappointment to read, hear or see in media that a United States senator has referred to this role model as pro-criminal. We know Justice White well and know that the facts do not in any way, shape, form or fashion resemble this distortion.\nMr. Ashcroft's careless remarks were very damaging to our community and to the work we do with our children.\nWe in the faith community believe that sensitivity to minorities is absolutely essential to our nation's chief law enforcement officer. Mr. Ashcroft, associating himself with and participating in organizations and institutions like the Southern Partisan Magazine and Bob Jones University, demonstrates insensitivity as well as poor judgment.\nWe felt deeply betrayed when Mr. Ashcroft's statement in the Southern Partisan Magazine and his acceptance of an honorary degree from Bob Jones University--two institutions notorious for their extreme racist statements and policies. Any affiliation with these kinds of institutions demonstrates complete disregard for our community.\nMr. Ashcroft's vocal and fervent opposition to the voluntary desegregation of Missouri schools was quality insensitivity. He was more concerned with the cost of desegregation than with the interests of African-American children in our community. He never apologized for segregation, he closed the door on negotiation and he strictly opposed desegregation.\nWe are deeply troubled by the strong stance that Mr. Ashcroft took while governor of Missouri to prevent independent voter registration drives in St. Louis. Opposing independent voter registration drives in St. Louis, which is about 53 percent African-American, were more than insensitive; it was offensive.\nThe senator's record opposing restrictions on handgun ownership and supporting the various concealed weapons shows a lack of common concern for the safety of our community. Too many of African-American youth die each year the victim of senseless handgun violence. We need less guns, not more guns. We need more control of handguns, not more handguns.\nFinally, to the issue of a woman's right to choose, Mr. Ashcroft's position is apparently far, far to the right of even the most conservative views. Regarding a woman's right to choose, Mr. Ashcroft says no, under any circumstances, at any risk.\nSo as we examine Mr. Ashcroft's record, we must ask ourselves whether we can count on the Justice Department under John Ashcroft to be fair on civil rights, fair on discrimination, fair on racial profiling, fair on handguns, and fair on a woman's right to choose.\nAs a minister of the Gospel and righteousness, speaking on behalf of myself and my colleagues, we have come too far and we've traveled too long to be turned back into the wilderness of indecision and cohesion based on race, color and national origin. We are not in the mood to have to retrace our steps, to be turned back into Egypt, where many have died in the struggle for civil rights and decent treatment.\nAs human beings, under our stars and stripes, shall we go back to the wilderness of repression, or shall we go forward into the full reality of the American dream?\nLEAHY: Thank you, Pastor.\nRICE: Your vote will tell the world the direction in which we, this great nation, will go.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Pastor. And...\nRICE: I'm not here to preach.\nLEAHY: Oh, no, no. I--listen, I like preaching. I always worry when I'm at church and I don't hear a sermon that gets me going.\nMr. Woodson, Pastor Rice takes a different position than you did.\nWOODSON: Yes.\nLEAHY: Went a bit over. And I will give you the same amount of time. I want to be as fair as possible. I'll give you the same amount of time over. But again, please try to...\nWOODSON: I will.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nWOODSON: Thank you. I'm Robert L. Woodson, senior president and founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a national nonprofit that assists low-income neighborhood leaders in 39 states. And I'm here today to represent a federation of grassroots faith-based organizations that operate throughout the nation. But I'm also a veteran of the civil rights movement, having served and organized demonstrations in the '60s and five years with the National Urban League.\nI'm here today, first of all, to voice strong support for Senator Ashcroft as attorney general.\nLet me just destroy a myth. There are those who tend to believe that the black community speaks in one voice. We are not monolithic. A lot of people talk about diversity, except when it comes to an expression of independent political views. And so I challenge my colleagues who come here before you and saying, \"The black community believes this, the black community wants this.\" We do not speak with a single voice.\nIt is prophetic irony that we meet at this time when four years ago a 12-year-old boy named Darryl Hall (ph) was snatched from a car on his way home just 20 minutes from here in an area called Simple City, Benning Terrace public housing. He was assassinated as a consequence of a conflict between two warring factions, the Avenue and the Circle. Fifty-five young black men died in a five-square-block area in two years as a consequence of this conflict.\nThe police couldn't make a difference. Social services couldn't make an impact. And--but the National Center, working with a faith-based organization, the Alliance of Concerned Men, went up into this area where people were huddled in their homes with refrigerators next to doors and brought these warring factions, the leadership, 16 of them, to my office downtown.\nThey were searched. They had bulletproof vests. We started with prayer. And we negotiated a settlement, the first truce. And as a consequence of this negotiation, we put these young people to work--thanks to the Housing Authority, David Gilmore--in rebuilding their community, taking out the graffiti.\nAnd I'm pleased to report, after four years of these faith-based organizations working in Benning Terrace, one of the most dangerous areas of the city, we have not had a crew-related killing in four years as a consequence.\nWOODSON: I have a young man here--stand up, Vernon--Vernon Wise (ph), who is a young man whose heart has been transformed as a consequence.\nThank you.\nVernon, in that war, was shot 10 times at point-blank range with a .45. He lost three of his ribs, his spleen and a kidney. And Vernon spent time in prison, six cells down from his father. To all conventional wisdom, he is godless, hopeless and useless. But we reached out to him in a spirit of godly love, and now Vernon is trained as a telecommunications specialist, having gone to school, and is now a responsible person.\nVernon is one of 100,000 young people like him whose lives have been transformed through these faith-based organizations, Teen Challenge, Victory Temple, who exist all over this nation.\nSenator John Ashcroft is the only person who, from the time he came into this body, reached out to us. He's on the board of Teen Challenge. He's raised money for them. He sponsored a charitable choice legislation that will stop the government from trying to close them down because they don't have trained professionals as drug counselors.\nWe have an 80 percent success rate of these faith-based organizations with a $60-a-day cost, when the conventional, therapeutically secular program cost $600 a day with a 6 to 10 percent success rate.\nSenator Ashcroft has gone with us. He has fought with us. And this legislation would help us.\nAs a consequence, day before yesterday, 150 black and Hispanic transformed drug addicts got on buses from all over this nation and came here to support him. Fifty of them came from Victory Temple throughout the state of Texas, spent two days on a Greyhound bus at their own expense to come here to voice strong support for Senator Ashcroft.\nAnd so let me say to you that a criminal personality is one who's very discerning, because you have to be in order to survive. They are not Democrats, they're not Republicans, they're not conservatives or liberal. But they know the real thing when they see it, and they came here to voice strong support for Senator Ashcroft.\nLet me say to those of you who hear charges of racism. As a civil rights veteran, I reject this notion that we should soil the rich legacy of the civil rights movement by using it as a sword against those with whom we have political disagreements, and as a shield to protect those who happen to agree with us who are even criminals.\nYou can be a pedophile, you can be a sex-abuser and you can be a thief and still score an A on the NAACP's credit card as long as you hold the right political views.\nAnd I have, as part of my testimony, an article that I published in the Wall Street Journal that gives names of people that have been supported for re-election to office who have committed these crimes.\nAnd so I am saying to you: We hope that you will vote this man in knowing that the black community does not speak with a single voice, and that we strongly support Senator Ashcroft. I'll be pleased to take questions or elaborate further on the reasons why we support this very noble man.\nI don't know why righteousness has to be an exemption for public service in America.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Woodson. I appreciate that.\nMr. Taylor?\nTAYLOR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and present testimony.\nI have been a civil rights lawyer for more than 45 years, beginning as a staff attorney for Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and later serving as general counsel and then staff director to the United States Commission on Civil Rights during the '60s.\nBy testimony--you know I'm well-affiliated, but my testimony today is solely on my own behalf.\nI am the lead counsel for a class--not a single--a class of African-American and white students in the major school case in St. Louis. I have served as counsel for more than 20 years, and for much of that time John Ashcroft was a lawyer and defendant in the case, first as Missouri state attorney general and later as governor.\nI have thought seriously since this nomination about whether Mr. Ashcroft's conduct in the St. Louis case was simply that of a lawyer vigorously defending the interests of the state or whether some of his actions went over the line of strong advocacy and reflect on his qualifications to serve as attorney general of the United States.\nMy conclusion is that the latter is the case. I believe that in his tenure as attorney general, Mr. Ashcroft used the court system to delay and obstruct the development and implementation of a desegegration settlement that was agreed to by all major parties except the state.\nIn so doing, he sought to prevent measures that were a major step toward racial reconciliation in an area where there had been much conflict and to thwart a remedy that ultimately proved to be a very important vehicle for educational progress.\nWorse yet, Mr. Ashcroft sought to exploit fears and misconceptions about desegregation as a means of gaining higher political office, thereby deepening racial divisions in the St. Louis area.\nTaken together, I believe these actions raise the most serious questions about whether Mr. Ashcroft is prepared to serve all the people as attorney general and to enforce the civil rights laws fairly and impartially. I realize these are serious charges, but I am prepared to document them.\nI assume my full statement will be in the record.\nLEAHY: Of course.\nTAYLOR: And I would like to concentrate the remainder of my time on statements that Mr. Ashcroft has made as a witness here. I will skip over statements that he made about whether the state was a party to the case at the time adjudications were made about its responsibility, and I will skip over his allegations that the state did nothing wrong. I think, Mr. Chairman, he may have taken some of those back in conversation with you.\nI want to focus on the question of whether it's true, as Mr. Ashcroft claimed, that in all cases where the court made an order, \"I followed the order both as attorney general and governor.\" And that, he did not repudiate. He, in fact, repeated. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nOne key period came in 1980, after the Court of Appeals asked the parties to explore the possibility of a voluntary integration remedy and Judge Meredith entered an order to begin the process. The state resisted the process at every turn.\nIn March of 1981, Judge Ungate (ph), who had taken over the case, found that, quote, \"the state, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of this court,\" and that the state had resorted to, quote, \"extraordinary machinations in an effort to resist dismantling the dual system.\"\nThese findings came after a lengthy recitation of numerous occasions on which the state had sought to delay and evade court orders. The court considered holding the state in contempt, but decided to make one more effort to issue an order that might result in state compliance. In doing so it said, quote, \"To grant the state defendants a stay would permit the state to escape triumphantly from the consequences of its defiance of Judge Meredith's court orders. The court would be doing much less than its duty if state defendants were not held accountable for their actions.\" And I've included this court order as an appendix to my testimony.\nThe resistance of John Ashcroft became quite personal. As I detail in my testimony, in July 1981, the court appointed Susan Neuchattel (ph), an employee of the state Department of Education, as interim director of the committee charged with developing a voluntary plan.\nThe state objected strenuously to Ms. Neuchattel's (ph) appointment and filed formal objections with the court which were later rejected. At the same time, the state sought to pressure Ms. Neuchattel (ph) to resign from the assignment.\nA contemporaneous log kept by Ms. Neuchattel (ph) reveals that a state education official relayed to her a threat from Mr. Ashcroft that if she chose to remain in the job, she would have to resign her state job, and if she did, she would, quote, \"never receive another state appointment to a job from them.\"\nDelaying tactics did not cease. Indeed, after our settlement with 22 suburban districts was reached, and the state appealed again and again, and it continued to resist the orders, even after its appeals were exhausted, the district court noted that the state had delayed implementation of the voluntary plan through opposition and repeated appeals and concluded that, \"were it not for the state and its feckless appeals, perhaps none of us would be here at this time.\"\nI'm almost done.\nThese tactics continued through Mr. Ashcroft's tenure as governor. Judge Limbaugh, Stephen Limbaugh, a Reagan appointee to the bench, referred to the conduct by the state that included \"factual inaccuracies, statistical distortions, and insipid remarks\"--that's a quote--regarding the court's handling of the case. He warned the state to desist in filing further motions grounded in rumor and unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing, and added that the state had even resorted in veiled threats toward the court to try to thwart implementation of the remedy.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nTAYLOR: In summary...\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Taylor.\nTAYLOR: ... contrary to Mr. Ashcroft's plan of review...\nLEAHY: Mr. Taylor, we have to--everybody's had exactly the same amount of time at this point, both for and against Senator Ashcroft.\nAnd, Ms. James, I understand from Senator Hatch that you had a conflict, you were supposed to be on a later panel, and to accommodate your schedule, we put you on this panel.\nHATCH: I don't know. Kay, can you be here tomorrow, because if you can, it would be better to have you? In fact, why don't we--we've got...\nLEAHY: I'm trying to accommodate everybody.\nHATCH: ... why don't we get the last three witnesses, have them give their testimony, and then if you can't stay...\nLEAHY: I think what we want to do is keep the thematic. I think we'll start questioning these. But, Ms. James, as I said to you, I'd be perfectly willing to have her come here.\nWhy don't you give your testimony, Ms. James?\nJAMES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd I do appreciate your accommodation.\nI will try to speak at a little more rapid pace than would be my normal cadence to get it in, and I do understand that we're all operating under time constraints.\nI want to thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be attorney general of the United States. My name, in fact, is Kay Coles (ph) James, and I'm a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\nI've known Senator Ashcroft for a number of years and in a variety of roles, beginning in 1991, as governor and as head of the National Governors Association, as a candidate, and for then also as a member of the United States Senate and as a presidential candidate and as a conservative activist.\nAlbert Einstein once said, \"It is the duty of every citizen according to his best capacities to give validity to his convictions in public affairs.\" John Ashcroft's long career not only exemplifies the virtue of devoted public service, but it is a testament to his efforts to give validity to his convictions.\nI've watched these hearings and thought that there was an important distinction that needs to be made. There is an enormous difference between being an advocate for a particular viewpoint or course of action, an activist, and in actually serving in government in an elected/appointed position. Each involves vastly different roles, different functions, and different goals and processes.\nMany spend their entire lives as advocates and truly do not understand the very different role of governing or interpreting the law. Being a state attorney general or governor or federal Cabinet member is quite different from being an activist or a partisan. Many individuals are not capable of making the transition. However, by his testimony and by his record as governor and attorney general, John Ashcroft has demonstrated that he understands the difference between being an activist and being a public servant.\nAt the root of Senator Ashcroft's strong views is his religious faith, which he has said is the bedrock of the principles which shape his life. Unfortunately, that faith has been dragged into the public debate and has been used to call into question his fitness for public service.\nThis sentiment troubles me greatly as an American. Senator Ashcroft's opponents have veered perilously close to implying that person of strong religious beliefs cannot be trusted with this office, perhaps with any office, on the pure basis that such a person will be unable to resist the temptation to use the office to impose his religious beliefs on others.\nThis assertion troubles me for many reasons, none more so than I would have thought that we, as a nation, had long ago transcended such prejudices. John Kennedy faced similar questions and attacks about a feared conflict between his Catholic faith and the duties of public office and demonstrated that ancient prejudices of this type have no place in our democracy. Similarly, I was heartened by Senator Lieberman's many references during the recent presidential campaign to the importance of faith in his life and in the nation as whole, and his refusal to be silenced by those who believed that mere discussion of personal faith in public life is a danger to be suppressed. Indeed, Al Gore professed wondering, \"What would Jesus do?\" when confronted with a difficult situation.\nSeveral members of the Senate have questioned whether or not a man of strong personal faith and conviction can set aside his personal beliefs and serve as the attorney general for all citizens. I would hope that this answer is obvious, not only from John Ashcroft's 25 years of remarkable service, but from the history of our nation as well.\nTo the contrary, I believe that John Ashcroft is precisely the type of individual we need in the public arena: a man of strong principles, of great integrity and intellect, who does not shirk from engaging in public discourse about the great issues of our day, and do so in a way that demonstrates not only his respect for others and divergent views, but an absolute and passionate commitment to the rule of law.\nThe system our founders designed, of course, is famous for its many checks and balances from which no public official is immune. Nevertheless, the charge is still made that these are insufficient to deal with a man of religious conviction. As such, a person cannot be trusted to faithfully execute the laws, especially those which may conflict with his deeply held belief.\nI reject such religious profiling. On this matter, let me attempt to reassure John Ashcroft's opponents by enlisting the very thing they profess to fear most: his religious faith.\nAs with every other holder of public office, John Ashcroft must take an oath before assuming his responsibilities, and in this secular age when even a hint of religion in the public sphere can arouse fierce opposition, we keep the religious element in our oath precisely because we understand the importance to the individual.\nJohn Ashcroft will raise his hand, if he is approved by the Senate and voted on to become the attorney general, and he will take an oath of office. And I think that it's great, I think that at this particular time in American history, it is so important to all of us to have people with character, with integrity, that when they raise their hand and they promise to defend and protect this great nation, we can count on them to do that.\nMr. Chairman, I have other comments and I will reserve them for the question-and-answer period and submit them for the record. Thank you, again, very much for your accommodation.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Ms. James.\nAgain, so we'll know the schedule, we'll go to 6:00 and we'll then, unless someone is in the middle of an answer of course, we'll reconvene at 9:00 and we'll go without any breaks until we finish, if that's possible.\nMs. James, I hope you heard my opening statements on these that no member of this committee makes the charge of either racial or religious bias when it refers to Senator Ashcroft. And I also stated that we all know better.\nI would like to clarify a misperception that has created some comments during the testimony of Senator Ashcroft, about the role of the late Mel Carnahan in the St. Louis desegregation case. Mr. Carnahan was the treasurer of the state of Missouri during the early 1980s. The state was ordered to make payments to fund desegregation. Under Missouri law, the treasurer can be held personally liable for making a payment without the warrant of the commissioner of administration of the state of Missouri.\nWhen Mel Carnahan was asked to sign a multi-million dollar check, he did ask, on the state's behalf, to wait for the U.S. District Court to issue an order telling the commissioner of administration to issue the necessary warrant instructing him to do it. Once he had the legal authority, he went and issued a check.\nSo, I didn't want anybody to have the impression that the late Mel Carnahan, in any way, sought to slow down the progress of desegregation in Missouri.\nMr. Taylor, during his testimony, Senator Ashcroft criticized the Kansas City school desegregation litigation. He said it was not helping children. So, let me ask you something about the St. Louis desegregation case.\nWhile then-Attorney General Ashcroft was litigating that case, he convinced the 8th Circuit that the state should not bear the cost of transferring students from one suburban district to the other. Now that part of the court's order covered only 300 students.\nTAYLOR: Right.\nLEAHY: There were just a few months remaining in the school year. I under stand that then-Attorney General Ashcroft moved immediately to cut off the state's payments for those students. It would have severely disrupted the education of those 300 children. If that's correct, is that something that would have helped the children? And how did the court react to that?\nTAYLOR: You're entirely correct, Mr. Chairman. It was during the middle of the school year that then-Attorney General Ashcroft asked that the children be sent back to the schools that they had transferred from. And it would have been enormously disruptive. And the court recognized that it would not have furthered their education. And it was probably one of the more blatant of many actions which did not serve the interests of school children.\nLEAHY: And I understand that he had called the voluntary desegregation plan, \"An outrage against human decency, an outrage against the children of this state\"--that was in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, on 6-15-84. But then I understand that he made political use of the fact that he was nearly subject to contempt of court from a federal court, saying he had done everything in his power, legally, to fight the desegregation plan and to prove his point he said, \"Ask Judge Ungate (ph), who threatened me with contempt.\"\nLEAHY: Is that the words of somebody who was supporting a plan of integration?\nTAYLOR: It is not the words of somebody who was supporting a plan. These were statements he made during a Republican primary where he was running against Gene McNary, who was another opponent of desegregation, and they were in many respects echoing words that I heard during the 1950s and 1960s during an era of massive resistance.\nI should add that Senator Ashcroft not only opposed this voluntary plan, but he also opposed other aspects of the court order that would require the state to pay money to improve the conditions of African-American children. He opposed funding for a school improvement plan in the central city and issued a press release about that.\nAnd he never, never during the course of all the years that he was involved in the case, offered any kind of alternative program that he would have suggested would work better to provide educational opportunity for minority children.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nMr. Henderson, the civil rights community's reaction to this nomination is what you've already stated. How does that compare to previous nominations for attorney general, including nominations made by Republican presidents?\nHENDERSON: Well, Mr. Chairman, I can assure you that many organizations within the civil rights community have never previously opposed an executive branch nominee for either the position of attorney general or for that matter others.\nThis is not something that is done regularly, very often, it is unusual. And what makes it especially disappointing in this instance is that many of us had hoped that with the new election the opportunity to bring the country together in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship would have been a positive gesture.\nCertainly there have been others who have been opposed, you know, in the past, but as I said to you, this is not a general matter that we undertake, and we certainly don't undertake it lightly.\nAnd we see this as an only option when issues of principle, such as those involved in the direction of the Department of Justice, are involved.\nLEAHY: The red light is on, so I yield to Senator Hatch.\nHATCH: Well, let me just say, I'm pleased to have all of you here and listen carefully to your testimony. I've been very interested in it, and that's all I'm going to say.\nLEAHY: Then we will go to Senator Kennedy.\nKENNEDY: Thank you very much. I thank the panel very much for all of your comments.\nMr. Taylor, one of the points of your enormously helpful testimony--and this is really the testimony. You were the attorney on this case. I hope, Mr. Chairman, that Senator Ashcroft will be given Mr. Taylor's testimony and be invited to make any comment on that, so that we have that record.\nBecause what you're basically saying, Mr. Ashcroft said initially the state wasn't involved, and you've indicated that it was involved. He indicated that he had complied with all the court orders. You've given us chapter and verse of the actions that were taken. And he would cast considerable question and doubt on that.\nHe had also indicated that he was just conforming to the law, trying to test the law, and doing it the way it should be done in the court of law. And your response on that is that the judges of those--that had the responsibility in the court found that these were frivolous, evidently. You use the--let me hear from you what the judges said when he kept repeating and repeating challenging the court orders that were ordering him to come up with a voluntary desegregation plan.\nWasn't he ordered in 1980, wasn't there a court order requiring Attorney General Ashcroft to submit a plan for desegregation within 60 days?\nTAYLOR: That's right. And he did not submit the plan.\nKENNEDY: Did he submit the plan?\nTAYLOR: He did not submit the plan. And that, I think, was part of what led to this court order that I have quoted which said that the state had defied the authority of the court and had resorted to extraordinary machinations in order to resist dismantling the dual system.\nKENNEDY: Now, this is how long after Brown v. Board of Education?\nTAYLOR: This is 1981, so it's 26 years after Brown v. Board of Education.\nKENNEDY: And spell out what's happening in the rest of the country. Is the rest of the country moving ahead in terms of trying to--in the complex, difficult and in many instances painful situations--I know it wasn't easy in my own city of Boston. But were they trying to move ahead in all parts of the country?\nTAYLOR: Well, certainly. And there had been widespread desegregation throughout the South after the Supreme Court decided the Greene (ph) and the Swann (ph) cases in the '70s.\nKENNEDY: Now, Missouri was one of the de jure states. It was covered by Brown v. Board of Education. And yet, in Missouri in 1980 and '81 you still had a condition of widespread segregation that the court felt it had to deal with.\nNow, is it fair to say there was over 16 years, eight years when he's attorney general and eight years as governor, that this case wasn't settled?\nTAYLOR: Well, it was settled over his objection while he was attorney general, and his appeals were rejected. And then the state continued, as Judge Limbaugh's order said, to try to obstruct implementation and not to fund the settlement that all the other parties had agreed to and that the court had entered as a consent decree and said was the law of the case.\nKENNEDY: And how--did sometime this get settled? After--when Mel Carnahan became...\nTAYLOR: Well, in the early '90s, the state moved under another attorney general to bring the case to a close, to achieve what was called unitary status. And we went to trial in 1996. And the court then appointed William Danforth as the settlement coordinator in the case. And Danforth had made his own study, found that this was a very valuable and workable plan, and he suggested and we then went--I joined him in going to the state legislature--and we got the legislature by a bipartisan vote and with Governor Carnahan's help to approve enough money to carry on the remedy. And then we entered into a new settlement, which is what you're referring to.\nKENNEDY: OK. And how are the students doing? Very quickly because I've got to...\nTAYLOR: The students are doing--most of the students are doing fairly well. The students who have transferred to the suburban school systems, I have to tell you, that contrary to what I think Mr. Ashcroft said, 75 percent of these kids are poor. They're free-and reduced-price-lunch eligible students. They are graduating high school at twice the rate of students in the city of St. Louis and students in other places. And they are going on to college at a very great rate. So they're doing well, and that program is working well.\nKENNEDY: Finally, Pastor Rice, we want to thank you for your testimony and for your presentation. You're a man of deep faith, and obviously committed to your community and equality for all.\nYesterday, we heard Senator Ashcroft respond to question regarding his interview with Southern Partisan magazine and his speech at Bob Jones University. Both took place while he was representing Missouri in the United States Senate, a state with approximately 500,000 African-American residents. Would you tell the committee what impact those events had on African-Americans in your St. Louis community? Were they surprised or hurt? Did they care?\nRICE: Yes, Senator Kennedy, we were past surprised, they were devastated, and they cared greatly. Not only did they care greatly, several petitions had been offered to the senator through several different grassroots organizations, asking him to return that honorary degree to the Bob Jones University, and, to this point, we've gotten no response.\nAnd so it was hurting and devastating to many of our community.\nLet me just say, for the record, that some say that we cannot speak in one voice. But I want to say that it was over 93 percent of the St. Louis and St. Louis area and Missouri of African-Americans that voted against John Ashcroft in this last November election. I think that's pretty close to a good voice.\nLEAHY: Senator Specter?\nSPECTER: Thank you.\nMr. Taylor, you have an extraordinary record for civil rights beyond any question. And I complement you for that.\nTAYLOR: Thank you, Senator.\nSPECTER: Former Senator Danforth testified yesterday that Senator Ashcroft, in litigation, was doing his job as a vigorous advocate. Would you have any suggestion for how a senator would evaluate the difference in judgments between you and Senator Danforth, without going into the voluminous records and practically relitigating the case, at least on an individual basis?\nTAYLOR: Well, I think--I appreciate your remarks, Senator. I think the best way is to look at what the court said about then-Attorney General Ashcroft's performance. And I'm not sure you were here when I...\nSPECTER: No, I was here. The follow-up question to that is did the court ever hold him in contempt?\nTAYLOR: I think--no, but it said that it was prepared to hold him in contempt. And it said that he had defied the orders of the court and engaged in extraordinary machinations.\nSPECTER: Did the court--I heard you say that before, and those are tough words. Did the court ever impose sanctions?\nTAYLOR: No. What happened after that was the attorney general turned in a--his responsibility was to turn in a plan--or a voluntary plan. And the court looked at it and found it so sketchy and inadequate that it just decided to disregard it and go forward with the effort without the state's participation to bring about voluntary desegregation.\nSPECTER: Mr. Taylor, I raised the question as to whether the court ever acted. They can act. They can hold you in contempt. They can impose sanctions.\nTAYLOR: Oh, that's correct.\nSPECTER: When I was district attorney, I was held in contempt of court one day for pressing a sentence on a narcotics pusher, Arnold Marks, who got a life sentence when he had several hundred thousand dollars worth of heroin. So, if a prosecuting attorney gets out of line in the eyes of the court, there are sanctions.\nSo I just wonder why, if it was all that bad, no sanctions were imposed as to Ashcroft.\nTAYLOR: Well, I think, Senator--I mean, I cheerfully concede that he was never held in contempt. And as far as I know, he was never sanctioned under Rule 11. But the courts did evaluate his performance. And the record speaks for itself about how many times he sought to file motions to relitigate questions that were already settled and to do other things that the court said added up to a record of defiance.\nAnd I don't know--you know, I think the--I don't think the sole standard is contempt. I would note that I'm not sure what kind of attention former Senator Danforth...\nSPECTER: Mr. Taylor, let me pose it from a little different angle, because there's pretty limited time here. Missouri's a pretty moderate state. In my day here, they sent Eagleton and Danforth and Bond.\nTAYLOR: Right.\nSPECTER: And shortly before I came, they sent Symington.\nIt's a state with a very moderate background. And Senator Ashcroft was elected fives times, twice as attorney general, twice as governor, then again as senator. If his conduct was so palpably outrageous, how, in a moderate state, could he be re-elected?\nIf a senator in Pennsylvania did what you say Ashcroft did, he couldn't be reelected and I think there are a lot of similarities between the states.\nTAYLOR: Well, I might defer to my friend Reverend Rice to answer that question. But I would note that moderate as it may be, Missouri has a very long-term history of racial discrimination which it has been struggling to eliminate. And some of the seminal cases, back to Jones v. Mayer, and other cases of discrimination, came to the Supreme Court from the state of Missouri.\nI can testify, Senator, because I've spent a lot of time out there, that race relations have been in a very difficult state.\nSPECTER: I have one more question on the--the warning light is on for you, Mr. Woodson--you have heard what Mr. Taylor has had to say and at least in his view, and he's a man of substantial standing in the civil rights areas, and describes Senator Ashcroft's conduct in very extreme terms. You say the African-American community doesn't speak with a single voice. How would you justify Senator Ashcroft's conduct in light of what Mr. Taylor has said?\nWOODSON: There has never been...\nSPECTER: May the record show my red light just went on.\nWOODSON: ... there has never been any single-mindedness on the issue of desegregation. Polls continually suggest, point out, that in the black community from the late '60s to forward, 50 to 60 percent of black Americans support desegregation in principle, but object to it in strategies in which it is carried out.\nSenator Kennedy's own city of Boston, 1973, Judge Garrity (ph), before he made his ruling, asked the community, Madapan (ph) and Jamaica Plain and all the grassroots people, people who suffering the problem, what they wanted. There were town meetings all over the city for about nine months.\nThe people in the community came back to Judge Garrity (ph) and said, \"We want the neighborhood schools strengthened. We do not want busing.\" But the civil rights leaders told Judge Garrity (ph), \"Forget about the will of the majority of black Americans who said they didn't want busing. Order the buses to roll.\" Even though not a single civil rights leader had their children on those buses. They were in private schools.\nAnd I recall, when I went there on behalf of the National Urban League to monitor this situation, talking to some of the white parents and some of the black parents. What we were doing, they said, is taking kids--black kids out of schools where there was a higher proportion going on to college and sending them into Southy, where one black--white parent said, \"Bring your children into these schools, they'll graduate as dumb as our kids.\"\nBut there has always been tension. In Atlanta, Georgia, the NAACP leader there struck a deal called the Atlanta Plan. They negotiated to get a higher per capita expenditure on the black schools. And they were--he was fired because--so that there is no monolithic thinking on--in the black community on the issue of busing.\nA large majority of blacks are opposed to forced busing for integration.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nTAYLOR: Senator, I need 15 seconds at the risk of offending the committee. In St. Louis, today and recent years, 12,000 to 13,000 children get on buses every day to go from city to the suburban schools. Their parents have decided that they are getting a better education that way. So whatever statistics may be cited, those are the facts in St. Louis.\nLEAHY: Senator Hatch and I said we will come back at 9:00, but I understand Senator Feingold just wanted to make a statement.\nFEINGOLD: I know that there's no time for my round at this point, but I just want to--I don't want the day to end without briefly, of course, thanking all of the panel for coming, including Ms. James. But I can't let the day end without just commenting on this notion that somehow the opponents of Senator Ashcroft have engaged in religious profiling.\nNow, I have decided to say some kind things about Mr. Ashcroft, including I made the mistake of saying I had a good working relationship with him. And as the result of that, we've had a lot of meetings with a lot of people I care a lot about, and both in private and public with every single group, every single time, not a single one has ever said anything about his religion other than to praise him, other than to admire.\nThis takes things to a level that I think is unacceptable. And as somebody that's, frankly, right in the middle of this, that is an unfair accusation with regard to the opponents of Senator Ashcroft.\nLEAHY: Well, with that, as we stated--and I have found no objection with Senator Hatch on this--there is nobody on this committee on either side that has attributed the kind of racial things on Senator Ashcroft. And I agree with what the senator from Wisconsin said, and I really resent very much we raise any question that somehow--because I hold my religion very, very dear to me--and I resent very much any much any suggestion that if you question a person's politics, their positions, their steps, the things they might do as attorney general that somehow your attacking either their race or their religion. That has not happened from either the Republicans or Democrats in this committee. And I want that very, very clear.\nHATCH: Well, let me just say this. I interpreted Ms. James as saying that some of the commentators and others have been bandying this around like it's reality.\nI haven't heard anybody on the committee or anybody in the Senate make any improper remarks.\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, on that subject, I think the tone of some of the remarks that have been repeated, like \"deeply held beliefs, deeply held beliefs,\" and things of that nature have suggested that because he has a rich religious faith that somehow he can't work within a legal system and comply to the law. That's my sensitivity to it. I think it's been suggested.\nLEAHY: You're hearing a trumpet that the rest of us don't hear.\nSESSIONS: And it's all right for this witness to reply to it. That's all I will say.\nLEAHY: You're hearing a trumpet the rest of us do not hear. Senator Hatch and I have both stated, made it very clear, that neither we heard from this panel anybody who ascribes either religious or racial bias to Senator Ashcroft, nor have we heard him say that about any of us.\nWith that, we'll stand in recess.", "timestamp": "2001-01-18", "title": "Attorney General Nominee John Ashcroft's Senate Confirmation Hearing (Day Three)"}

BINGAMAN: I had advised that we would go ahead and have a vote on the nominee for secretary of energy at this point. I'm told that we need a couple more senators to have a voting quorum, so we will have to put that off here for just another couple of minutes.\nLet me make another couple of announcements. The plan would be to proceed with this hearing on the secretary of interior nominee until about 5 o'clock this afternoon, adjourn at that time. Begin again at 9:00 tomorrow morning, and we would then hope to complete the hearing sometime tomorrow. That would be the hope.\nWe have two new members who are not official, as I understand it. They are unanimously expected to be official. And that's Senator Shelby and Senator Kyl. We welcome them to the committee. And they join with Senators Feinstein and Schumer and Cantwell as the new members of this committee.\nThe new members on this side, I'm advised, are in the Judiciary Committee at their hearing this afternoon. And that's where you may be headed--Senator Kyl may be headed. But we appreciate you being here, and we are glad to have you and hope you can participate.\nWhile we're waiting for a quorum to have a vote on the Abraham nomination, let me go ahead with an opening statement, and then, I'm told, Senator Dorgan is about to arrive and that will give us enough.\nIn keeping with the past practices of this committee in reporting Cabinet nominations made by incoming presidents prior to their official receipt by the Senate, we would recognize Senator Murkowski to make a motion with regard to secretary of energy nominee Spencer Abraham.\nSEN. MURKOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI move that the committee report favorably on the proposed nomination and recommend that when the nomination is received, the Senate give its advice and consent.\nBINGAMAN: Everyone has heard the motion. All in favor say, aye.\nCOMMITTEE MEMBERS: Aye.\nBINGAMAN: Opposed, no.\nAyes have it and the motion is agreed to.\nNow moving on to our hearing this afternoon, I would propose to follow the same format that we used this morning; that is, that I would make a brief opening statement, Senator Murkowski would then make whatever statement he would like, we would then call upon the two senators from Colorado and Governor Owens to introduce the nominee and call on Ms. Norton to make her statement.\nAnd once that is completed, we would then go to questions and have an eight-minute round of questions from each member. If there are additional questions after that first round, we will have additional rounds of questions, and they will be five minutes each.\nWith that set of ground rules, let me go ahead and make a short statement.\nThe purpose of this hearing this afternoon is to consider the nomination of Gale Norton to be the secretary of interior. The office of the secretary of interior is one of the highest positions of public trust in our federal government. The secretary is the principle steward of nearly a third of our nation's land. The secretary is the chief trustee of much of the nation's energy and mineral wealth as well. The secretary is the principle guardian of our national parks and our most revered historic sites and much of our fish and wildlife. It is the job of the secretary of interior to protect this precious legacy and to pass it on to future generations.\nWhile the president is clearly entitled to appoint Cabinet members who share his political views, the Senate has a constitutional duty to ensure that the secretary of interior will be a faithful steward of the public lands and our national treasures.\nI have no doubt that Ms. Norton is an extremely decent and capable person, and we have many recommendations to that effect. I do have doubts about some of the policies that she has promoted and whether they are consistent with the responsibilities of the job of secretary of interior.\nFor over 20 years, she has consistently championed the interests of individuals, as opposed to the public interest, in many of the issues that come before this committee and before the office of the secretary of interior. She's championed the rights of states as opposed to the federal government and the interests of economic development rather than environmental protection in many cases.\nThese positions may have been understandable for a lawyer representing her clients. It certainly may have been understandable for an attorney general of a Western state, and I have some experience in that regard, and may have been understandable for a Republican Senate candidate. But some of those positions are disturbing, at least to my mind, in a nominee for secretary of interior.\nThis hearing will afford Ms. Norton the opportunity to state her views on the role of the secretary of interior, explain how she can reconcile her past positions with the responsibilities that she would have entrusted upon her in this new position. And her answers to these questions will determine how I am able to vote on this nomination.\nSenator Murkowski?\nMURKOWSKI: Thank you very much, Chairman Bingaman. And I want to commend you and your staff, working with our staff, for the structure of this hearing. And I think that with the testimony that we're going to hear, we're going to be able to answer many of the questions that we have relative to this nominee.\nI want to commend our President-elect Bush for nominating the first woman--the first woman--for the secretary of the interior. I think it's an outstanding nomination of a candidate who has certainly the knowledge, the experience, to take on one of most challenging positions in the executive branch.\nHer responsibility is one, in my opinion, of balance. She is going to have to balance the protection of our nation's resources with the realism that we need to develop those resources using the best technology available. I think one of the themes that has been suggested is using fuels of today to get to the technology of tomorrow.\nNow, this is a balance, in my opinion, that has swung dramatically out of proportion in the last eight years, as evidenced by the energy crisis that is existing in this country today, and more particularly, in the state of California where, as a matter of fact, to some extent, the lights are out.\nNow, I've heard criticism that Ms. Norton has been identified with groups that advocate such things as more complete appreciation of the economic consequences of governmental action or a better understanding of the balance provided by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. The issue of power of the federal government vis-a-vis the states has always been a contentious issue and it isn't going to go away. But there's always been room for diversity and debate in the marketplace of ideas, and that includes the Department of Interior.\nDid his work as president of the League of Conservation Voters disqualify the previous secretary, Bruce Babbitt? Did George Frampton's lobbying for and his position as head of the Wilderness Society disqualify him? No, they both had strong advocacies for their point of view. I guess it depends on whether you happen to agree with their point of view. So it is a question of balance.\nNow, those on the ideological side of the current protesters are going to be heard through, I think, various members of this committee.\nMs. Norton has been accused only of guilt by association, has been tarred with innuendoes, and brushed with, I think, misinterpretation.\nWell, today, let us look at the record and proceed with this nomination hearing. You know, this committee has had a long history of asking tough questions on policy issues and avoiding character assassination. And I know this tradition can continue. Senator Bingaman and I have worked closely together during the time I was chairman, and, in a day-and-a-half or two, will continue to work closely together when I resume that responsibility, assuming my colleagues on the right are of that particular disposition.\nAnd if they're not, we can talk...\n(LAUGHTER)\nNo, I didn't mean that.\nI don't think the implication of the Natural Resource Defense Council, that Gale Norton is an anarchist, should have any place in this society. On the other hand, caution is in order. We need the balances I stated.\nAnd you know, I often recall with some amusement when the so-called cell phone naturalist drives his or her sports utility vehicle into the national forest. He calls home on his cell phone, looks for direction from his Global Positioning System, checks the time on his watch as he communes, I guess, with nature. He makes the decision there and then that no mining, no energy development, should ever take place in this spot. He ignores the fact that each person in this nation uses about 22,000 pounds of non-energy minerals each day, and those minerals must come--they must come from somewhere.\nNow we look at the timber resources, which is renewable. Do we want them to come from the rain forests of South America, where there's very little environmental control or do we want to bring it along in a renewable basis from our own force in this country, where we can do it right, through the regeneration process.\nAt the same time, the beauty that this so-called, I guess, cell-phone naturalist recognizes, we have to have a realistic claim on protection for future generations. So again, it's a question of balance.\nBalance is the key, in my opinion, at the Department of Interior, and I think Ms. Norton will provide that balance.\nThe secretary is responsible for our public domain, the public lands that support wilderness, recreation, grazing, forestry, mining, oil, gas development, and many, many other uses as well. If we are going to deal honestly with our energy situation, we will need carefully to examine the process for granting right of ways. How can you generate more energy sources if you don't have right of ways?\nThe same can be said for transmission corridors and the needs for rural communities for access. Unlike the various interest groups, who have the luxury of advocating only one position, the secretary has been given the mandate to balance those needs and be a steward of the land on behalf of all Americans, not just special interest groups.\nAs a consequence, I think we'd all agree that the secretary has trust responsibilities as well that go into the Indian tribes. Very frankly, the record there has not been a very good one. The management of the trust funds, in my opinion, has been a disaster.\nActivities under the mining laws, the Mineral Leasing Act, the outer continental shelf, will all come under her direction. We have the capability to develop the vast supplies of oil and gas in this nation in an environmentally sensitive manner, and we should do so. What's not being given credibility is the advanced technology that we've been able to develop.\nAs we, if you will, evaluate the risk associated with that development, I'm reminded, in my own state of Alaska, about 15 years ago, we brought in the 10th largest field, and we used 56 acres. It was called Endicott. It was the technology of 15 to 20 years ago. Given the opportunity, because of our increased dependence on imported oil, which is about 57 percent, and the Department of Energy indicated this morning it would be up to 62 percent within the next four years.\nWe have an opportunity to open up a portion of the coastal plain. That's 19 million acres up there, an area the size of the state of South Carolina. Yet industry tells us that if the oil is there, the footprint is 2,000 acres.\nThat's what's lacking in the consideration, in my opinion, by the environmental community that we, as we look at our ability, by using technology, to open up our resources in an appropriate manner.\nNow, as secretary, you're going to have the responsibility for the U.S. territories. Many people overlook that, but we can't on this committee, because we're the committee of oversight. Our record isn't very good there. The Virgin Islands are on the edge of bankruptcy. American Samoa is surviving only by borrowing against its portion of the tobacco settlement. The northern Mariana Islands has an economy that has been allowed to become totally dependent on an immigration and labor situation that simply should not exist under the American flag. And to a large degree, it's ignored.\nSenator Akaka and I have worked very hard on that. We've been over there and observed that situation. And I can tell you, it's despicable.\nAll of these areas require an openness and a willingness to undertake the balance necessary to provide for the needs of this and future generations. I am confident that she will carefully enforce the laws and work with the Congress and, particularly, this committee.\nOn a personal note, Ms. Norton has been to Alaska on several occasions, and that's several more times than some of the self-appointed experts who want to manage my state. She knows what the effect of decisions made in Washington can be on local economies, and how dependent those economies are on the federal estate. And she has, I think, a distinguished record of public service and the respect of those she has dealt with as well. She has also had a record of openness and being directly involved in decisions.\nI am certainly pleased to support her nomination. And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to add for the record the names of 12 governors supporting her nomination--the governors of Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, North Dakota, Nevada and Montana, as well as Colorado. I would ask that be included in the record.\nBINGAMAN: That will certainly be included in the record.\nMURKOWSKI: I thank the chair.\nBINGAMAN: We now have our two distinguished colleagues from Colorado here to introduce the nominee, as well as the governor of Colorado. So first I'll call on Senator Campbell.\nCAMPBELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a member of this committee, I am honored and pleased to be introducing my friend and my colleague of many years, my fellow Coloradan...\nBINGAMAN: Could you pull that mike up, a little bit, Senator Campbell?\nCAMPBELL: Yes. Sorry.\nI am pleased to introduce my friend and colleague, Gale Norton, from Colorado. She's overwhelmingly qualified, and the absolute right person for the secretary of interior post. I've known Gale, as all of us have here at this table, for many years. And let me state, right up front and for the record, she has a long and distinguished record of doing the right thing, always.\nShe is a consensus builder, which might best be illustrated by her eight years as Colorado's attorney general, where she served under a Democratic governor, and still accomplished many initiatives for the betterment of Colorado, including Superfund cleanups. For more than 20 years, she has provided leadership on environmental and public lands issues and has demonstrated a responsible, common sense approach in preserving our natural heritage.\nIn my view, in fact, she's being accused now, as you probably have read in the newspapers, of being not centrist enough. But I liken that to the current administration, which has in the last few years advocated tearing down dams. And I think, if you went to California now and talked to the people who are closing their factories, and the lights are shut off in their restaurants, and they can't see the stop lights, because they're out on the corners, and so on, and you talk to them and said, \"Is tearing down the energy producing dams a centrist view?\" they would probably say, not so, and they would agree much more with Gale Norton, who believes in the careful production of energy.\nAnother significant fact to know about Gale Norton is that she is committed to enforcing the law as it is written and not by rule and regulation. As attorney general of Colorado, she created an environmental crimes task force to prosecute the most flagrant polluters. She has played a leading role in the cleanup of pollution at mining sites to protect the environment and restore Colorado's natural resources. And she led the way in ensuring a safe cleanup of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, personally arguing and winning a landmark case in court to force the federal government and an oil company to meet Colorado standards for environmental protection and public health, which in many cases are more stringent than federal standards.\nGale Norton believes that everyone has a role to play in defending and preserving our environment. Businesses and communities, government and people, all need to have a seat at the table. As you know, in the last couple of days, nine more large tracts of land have been locked up in the West without any local input whatsoever. Gale believes that local people should be involved in decision-making and that their lifestyle, that is often dependent is often dependent on those public lands, should be considered.\nAs a researcher at Stanford University, Ms. Norton researched emissions trading approaches, like those later adopted in the Clean Air Act. These approaches created market-based incentives for businesses to reduce emissions. Gale Norton supported Colorado's audit law, a law which was co-sponsored by several Democrats and signed by a Democratic governor, to achieve better environmental protection by encouraging early and full identification of environmental problems, and most important, long-term decisions.\nAnother issue, which is important to many of the members on this committee, since they come from public land states in the West, is that of water rights. Gale Norton has championed western water rights over the years. Growing populations and changing values are placing increasing demands on our existing and limited water supplies in the West, resulting in water-use conflicts throughout the country.\nRecent conflicts are particularly apparent out where we live, where agriculture needs for water are often in direct conflict with urban needs, like the demand for water for the Endangered Species Act, for recreation and picturesque scenery. In the arid West, naturally scarce water supplies and growing urban populations have increased federal-state tensions, because states have historically had primacy in interstate water allocation.\nDebate over western water centers over the issue of best to plan for, and manage the use of this limited resource. I believe that Gale Norton will be able to use her background in water issues to build consensus, and start settling some of the disputes on water.\nShe was one of the first and early advocates of the Colorado Youth Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, commonly called the ALP, which you, Chairman Bingaman, and I both supported over the years. As the past chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, and I suppose the next chairman in a few more days again, I believe that Gale will effectively manage Indian affairs with the Department of Interior, which it has responsibility for.\nDuring her eight-year tenure as Colorado's attorney general, Gale Norton developed a strong working relationship with Colorado's two tribes, the Ute Mountain tribe and the Southern Ute tribe. Together they worked on a number of important matters including water rights settlements, environmental regulation, taxation, and a whole bunch of other complex issues. In fact, she testified a number of times before our committee. She is very knowledgeable in Indian law and she will bring that knowledge and experience of the working with the tribes to the department. I am confident that she will continue that work.\nI have two letters, I'd ask unanimous consent, from the Ute Mountain Indian tribe and the Southern Ute tribe supporting her nomination, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: We'll include those in the record.\nCAMPBELL: And Mr. Murkowski mentioned the trust fund debacle over there at the Interior Department. All of us on this committee are aware that there's $2.5 billion of missing money in the Bureau of Indian Affairs account that they say is there, but nobody can find it. She has made that a priority, to try to straighten that up and make sure the people who actually own that money, the individual Indians living on trust land, will receive their just dues.\nMr. Chairman, the Ute tribes strongly support her, but in talking with other tribes around the country, they also, all the ones I have talked to, also support her. She listens to common sense while she searches for common ground. And unlike many in Washington, she understands that real environmental solutions seldom come just from the Beltway professionals. They come from real people with honest concerns for the land and the water, people on the ground dealing with those concerns on a daily basis.\nShe will insist that the federal government work with local communities to find the best way to preserve and protect our nation's natural resources.\nI am pleased to say that Gale Norton has my full support and will make an outstanding secretary of the interior.\nAnd frankly, I'm a little disturbed about the opposition. I saw this morning's Washington Post, as you probably did, with a full-page ad taken out by some of the extreme environmental community, where they have half her face on the page and half of her face off the page, and I know that it seems to be in vogue now to disagree with the nominees by embarking on some form of character assassination.\nBut I would compare that senseless business in The Post this morning with the very thoughtful and carefully written editorial by our colleague John Breaux, who is a man that I think everybody in this body supports, who basically says in his editorial that she is a good person for the job and should be supported.\nThose shrill voices of the extreme elements of our society we're hearing now in the current process of confronting our nominees, I think they have very limited perspectives and make up in shrillness what they lack in common sense, in my view.\nMr. Chairman, as a member of this committee, I offer my support once again to Gale Norton, and I thank you.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you very much.\nSenator Allard?\nALLARD: Mr. Chairman, it's an honor for me to be here to be able to introduce to you Gale Norton, secretary-designate for the Department of Interior. I've know Gale Norton for some time. I consider her to be a very close friend. She's a great Coloradan. She was born and educated in the state of Colorado. Today, she enjoys many of the natural resources we have in our great state.\nI want to take a few moments to talk about her resume. As you might imagine, she has a long one. So what I've done is I've selected those parts of her resume which I think are very important to the committee's deliberations today as they consider her nomination by the president for secretary of the interior.\nShe graduated magna cum laude from the University of Denver in 1975. Then she went on to graduate from the college of law with a juris doctorate degree in 1978.\nShe's a member of the law school honor society.\nShe moved forward from that point with her academic credentials to become a part of the faculty the University of Denver. She is truly an academician. She knows how to evaluate issues. She knows how to talk about the pros and cons of various issues that may come before her.\nAnd because of this strong academic background, she was frequently called upon to give speeches and to talk to groups in Colorado and across the country on issues that were important to them in which she was considered an expert.\nShe went on from the University of Colorado to serve as a law clerk for the Colorado Court of Appeals. In the 1980s, she decided to come to Washington and she worked for the United States Department of Agriculture. and then moved over to the Department of Interior as associate solicitor for conservation and wildlife.\nThen she returned back to Colorado. She ran for public office and was elected by the people of Colorado to serve as their attorney general. She served from 1991 to 1999 as Colorado's attorney general.\nThe point that I'd like to make to the committee is that Gale Norton has had a broad experience in her life. It includes her having to walk in many of the shoes of somebody who's worked for a federal agency here in Washington, in the Department of Agriculture, as well as in the Department of Interior. She's had to walk into the shoes of the state from which she was born and educated, representing many of her constituents as the attorney general of the state of Colorado.\nI think that when we look at her academic background, when we look at her experience both at the federal level and at the state level, I think she is uniquely qualified to be the next secretary of the interior. And I strongly endorse her, because I think her total of 20 years of experience on environmental and natural resource issues will make her a great secretary of the Department of Interior.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you very much.\nWe're honored to have Governor Bill Owens from Colorado here also to introduce the nominee.\nPlease go right ahead.\nOWENS: Senator Bingaman, thank you very much. And members of the committee, thank you for allowing me to say a few words on behalf of Gale Norton.\nIt's good to be back in the Senate. Twenty-five ago, I served on the staff of Senator John Tower. And I regret to this day what happened to him, to that fine American, during his Senate confirmation. Years before that, I served with Jim Wright. I was Jim Wright's page in the House of Representatives. And I have a lot of respect for what it is you're charged with doing this afternoon.\nAnd I guess what I really hope is is that we don't take this fine person and tear her apart through this process. Because I know Gale Norton, I've worked with her, I've known her for 15 years, and this is a dedicated public servant who has always done what she thought was best for the people of Colorado.\nI'm going to not be redundant to what my friends Senator Campbell and Senator Allard have already said. You've heard about her distinguished eight-year career as attorney general.\nYou know, when you're looking to see where Gale Norton comes from, it's important to note that she was elected in 1990 in a landslide as a Republican in the same year that Governor Roy Romer was reelected by a landslide as a Democrat in Colorado. The same thing occurred in 1994. Gale Norton won in a landslide on the Republican side. Roy Romer again won in a landslide on the Democratic side.\nIt's because Colorado is a centrist state. It votes for the person, not the party. And in voting for Gale Norton, it was voting for a person who really represented the mainstream that I think is the reality of Colorado.\nYou're going to hear a lot today about a number of issues. Just from a Colorado perspective, we have a self-audit law in the state of Colorado, as do 29 other states in this union. And in Colorado this law passed, for reference purposes, by a vote of 60-4 in our House of Representatives, obviously bipartisan. It passed our Senate by a vote of 24-8, again clearly bipartisan. It was then signed into law by Governor Roy Romer. And it was Gale Norton's job as attorney general to defend that Colorado law in court, a defense which she performed admirably.\nBut that law was a bipartisan law, a well-intentioned and I believe successful effort to bring more companies into a partnership in terms of cleaning up the environment. And again, today it's been copied throughout these United States.\nYou're going to hear about a mine called Summitville. Summitville is a disaster which we're all familiar with in Colorado. Just let the record reflect that that mine was cited in 1983 under the administration of my very good friend Governor Dick Lamm. The environmental failure occurred in 1986.\nGale Norton was elected in 1990. She took office in 1991. She sued the owner of Summitville in 1992; sued the owner again to keep the mine filtering system open when that owner declared bankruptcy; sued the personal owner of that mine in 1996; and three weeks ago, current Attorney General Ken Salazar of Colorado, a Democrat, was able to settle with that owner for almost $30 million based on the work that he did and based on the work that Gale Norton did.\nAnd that's one reason I believe that Ken Salazar, our Democratic attorney general in Colorado, along with four other Democratic attorney generals, has endorsed Gale's nomination.\nI'm so proud of what she did with Rocky Mountain Arsenal. This is a chemical warfare plant that we have just outside of the Denver metropolitan area. She sued the federal government to force a cleaner standard, a higher standard of cleanup, actually to force the federal government to follow Colorado's standard rather than federal standards for the cleanup of that site, and she won that lawsuit. In suing the federal government, she also sued Shell Oil Company.\nShe's done the same thing with Rocky Flats, our nuclear bomb factory, which also is right outside of Denver, Colorado. She has gone to court to allow individuals to sue the federal government under the Superfund Act.\nThis is a lady that is moderate and centrist and has worked hard for our environment in Colorado, and I know would do an outstanding job as secretary of the Interior.\nOne final issue that I know you're going to hear about, and it concerns a legal case called the Aderand case in the state of Colorado. It's a case involving minority set-asides and involving a lawsuit against the state of Colorado by a gentleman named Aderand.\nColorado had in place a set of required, mandatory set-asides for construction projects. Over the years, the Supreme Court had successively weakened its standard and in fact made it clear that our Aderand case was indefensible in court based on Supreme Court dicta.\nSo there was an attempt in Colorado to pursue this case to higher courts. Our governor, Governor Roy Romer, wanted to pursue the appeals higher. Gale Norton, as an attorney and as attorney general, said we're going to lose if we do so.\nSenator Bingaman, you've been an attorney general, and I know we have a former governor, Mr. Bayh, Senator Bayh. She said to her client, we can't win this case and we shouldn't pursue it. Under Colorado law, the governor had the right to pursue it and did so by retaining outside counsel, a former supreme court justice, and we lost twice in the U.S. Supreme Court. She was fulfilling her oath as an attorney and as attorney general of Colorado in terms of following what the Supreme Court had told us was legal.\nSo, gentlemen, I really appreciate your courtesy in allowing a governor to speak to you today. I'm telling you that Colorado is proud of Gale Norton. As a state senator, I voted on 266 of Governor Romer's appointees in my six years in the state senate. I voted for 264 of that governor's appointees. I understand the constitutional responsibility you have to advise and consent. I just ask you to, as I know you will, Mr. Chairman, give this lady a fair hearing, and as you do so I'm confident she'll be confirmed.\nThank you very much.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you for your statement. I thank all three of you for your statements.\nMs. Norton, I am required to administer the oath to you, but before I do so, did you have family members you wanted to introduce before we went through that formality?\nNORTON: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce my husband, John Hughes.\nBINGAMAN: We welcome him to the committee.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe rules of the committee, which apply to all nominees, require that the nominee be sworn in connection with their testimony. Could you please rise and raise your right hand, please?\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nNORTON: I do.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you. Why don't you be seated. And let me ask you three questions. Will you be available to appear before this committee and other congressional committees to represent departmental positions and respond to issues of concern to the Congress if you are confirmed?\nNORTON: Yes, I will be.\nBINGAMAN: Are you aware of any personal holdings, investments or interest that could constitute a conflict or create the appearance of such a conflict should you be confirmed and assume the office to which you have been nominated by the president?\nNORTON: I have worked with the Office of Government Ethics to review my finances. We have determined that there is one company in which I own stock, that I will divest, and so that will not be a continuing conflict.\nI have also taken additional steps to ensure that appearances of conflict are alleviated. For example, I had a tax-sheltered annuity that was established when I worked with Mountain States Legal Foundation. I will be moving that into another program so there is absolutely no connection with the foundation.\nBINGAMAN: OK. And the final question, are you involved or do you have any assets held in blind trusts?\nNORTON: No, sir, I do not.\nBINGAMAN: OK. Why don't you go ahead with your statement then. Thank you.\nNORTON: Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and distinguished members of the committee. I am honored to appear before you today as President-elect Bush's nominee for secretary of the interior. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with you and to answer any questions that you might have.\nI am glad to have this chance to tell you something about the goals that President-elect Bush and I share, and which we hope to achieve, if you see fit to confirm me as secretary of the interior.\nAs you all know, America is a land of singular beauty. Americans are proud of the many exquisite natural treasures within our shores. President-elect Bush believes, as I do, that the top priority of the Department of the Interior must be to conserve those natural treasures.\nOne of President-elect Bush's priorities is to protect our national park system. We plan to return scientists to our parks and work with Congress to eliminate the major maintenance backlogs that have been obstacles to resource protection, and to do that within five years.\nThis initiative would help restore our national parks and ensure a positive legacy of protecting our cultural, natural and recreational treasures for Americans today and in the future.\nThe great wild places and unspoiled landscapes of this country are the common heritage of all Americans and we must both conserve them and manage them for Americans living today and for the Americans of the future, our children and our children's children. That is our goal.\nI don't think any of us here today would disagree on that goal. In that, I believe, lies the basis for common ground. We have the opportunity for bipartisan environmental cooperation and leadership.\nI've worked for more than 20 years on environmental issues. I'm proud of my accomplishments. Preserving endangered species. Cleaning up mountain valleys polluted by mining. Working to convert the Rocky Mountain Arsenal from a place polluted by pesticides and nerve gas residues to a wildlife refuge.\nBased on these experiences, I am firmly committed to a process of consultation and collaboration. We should listen to all voices and involve all citizens. That is fair.\nIt is also wise. People are a magnificent resource for ideas, for knowledge, for insights.\nI've lived and worked here in Washington. I've also lived and worked in the great American West. Those of us here in Washington need to be good partners with Americans living in other parts of this country and in our territories.\nAmerica is a stronger nation because of the diversity of its people. These people hold many different views and perspectives. We need to work with them, to involve them, to benefit from their creativity and their capacity to innovate.\nOne top priority that I want to mention to you today concerns the special responsibilities of the secretary of the interior with regard to American Indians. I think we should all recognize that the situation in Indian Country is not as it should be. There is much that I believe we can do in partnership with our nation's proud Native American tribes to improve conditions and provide a more hopeful future.\nPresident-elect Bush has said many times that he will leave no child behind. To accomplish that requires that we improve the schools that serve more than 50,000 Native American children. A good education is the key to a better life for any child, whether that child lives in Washington, D.C., or Miami, Florida, or on a reservation in New Mexico.\nRecognizing the historic relationship of the federal government and Native American tribal governments, I will work very hard to achieve real results for every Indian child.\nPresident-elect Bush has proposals to build conservation partnerships to help states, local communities and private land owners to conserve wildlife habitat, watersheds and open space. I'm excited by the chance to work together on these proposals. Working together, there is much that we can do to promote conservation in the United States.\nMr. Chairman and members of the committee, I will be candid in telling you that I am both a conservative and a conservationist. I see no conflict there. In fact, I am a compassionate conservative and a passionate conservationist. I believe that, too, is entirely consistent.\nIf confirmed as secretary of the interior, I intend to make the conservation of America's natural resources my top priority. Using consultation and collaboration, forging partnerships with interested citizens, we can succeed in our effort to conserve America's most precious places. What's more, we can achieve this while maintaining America's prosperity and economic dynamism, while respecting constitutional rights and nurturing diverse traditions and cultures.\nIt won't always be easy. It will require a lot of hard work and the willingness to be creative, to think outside the usual boxes.\nThat is the mission that President-elect Bush has asked me to undertake. With your help, your wisdom and your cooperation, I believe that we can succeed.\nThank you very much.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you very much.\nLet me start with some questions.\nYour statement about your priorities is welcome and I certainly heard that with great interest.\nA few years ago, according to a writing that you did, you described yourself as a free market conservative, an advocate of judicial restraint, as well as a champion of state's rights. And over the years you have taken some positions on the takings clause, for example, on the federal taxing power, on the 10th Amendment, on the now long-discredited theory about economic due process, which seem, at least as I read some of those earlier writings of yours, to be at odds with mainstream legal thought.\nCan you give this committee assurance that, if confirmed, you would feel comfortable enforcing the existing laws and regulations of the Department of Interior as they now stand?\nNORTON: Mr. Chairman, I have served in eight years in the capacity of a state attorney general, enforcing the laws of Colorado and of the United States, and I feel very comfortable in enforcing the laws as they are written. I will be fully committed to ensuring that our nation's environmental laws and laws for the protection of natural resources will be fully enforced.\nBINGAMAN: Many of the Republican members of Congress, some on this committee, have been sharply critical of the environmental initiatives and policies of Secretary Babbitt and of President Clinton and his administration. Which, if any, of those legal or policy positions that have been adopted by the Department of Interior during this last eight years would you depart from or attempt to change?\nNORTON: There are many things that have been adopted over the past few years. We will be looking at what needs to be changed, in our views, and at the many things that will remain the same. We will examine issues across the boards and apply the best legal standards, as well as the views that I believe many of us would share, to ensure that we are doing the best to preserve our natural resources.\nAt this point, I'm not sure where we may depart from the past administration. But we will carefully examine those things and work with this Congress in order to examine issues.\nBINGAMAN: One issue that the president and the secretary of interior--the current secretary of interior had been roundly criticized about by Republicans here in the Congress is this issue of designation of national monuments. I believe this president has designed 19 areas as national monuments under the authority that he has under the Antiquities Act.\nDo you believe that President Clinton's use of that Antiquities Act was appropriate or not?\nNORTON: The goal of preserving lands is an admirable goal and I share the goal of trying to be sure that we are identifying those areas that ought to be natural treasures and setting those aside.\nThe process in which those decisions were made is one that causes me concern. Many of those decisions were made through a top-down process without consulting the people who are most affected by those decisions.\nPresident-elect Bush has established his view, and I certainly share that, that decisions about the land should be made in a process that includes the people who are affected by those decisions. And I would certainly hope that in the future we would hear input from those of you on this committee, from governors, from local communities, before we take actions that are going to deeply impact people's lives.\nBINGAMAN: Would you advocate repeal of the Antiquities Act or some changes in that basic statute?\nNORTON: The Antiquities Act is something that has been very useful in the past. It has shown its ability to preserve some of our most important national monuments.\nI would like to see a process of involvement of the people most affected by decisions. That certainly would be the practice that would be followed in a Bush administration if I am selected to be secretary of the interior. Whether that would require changes in that statute for the long term is a decision that I have not made in terms of what we would advocate, and obviously would require congressional action in order to make any of those changes.\nBINGAMAN: On this issue of water rights, do you agree that when the federal government reserves land from the public domain, that it also impliedly reserves a sufficient quantity of water to fulfill the primary purposes of the land that it has reserved, thereby creating a federal reserved water right?\nNORTON: The U.S. Supreme Court has established clear standards for determining whether a federal reserved water rights is established with any particular reservation and it depends on an examination of each particular area and the purposes for that.\nWhat it boils down to at the core is the intent of Congress and whether Congress intended, when it set aside some land, or whether in a presidential proclamation setting aside land, the purpose of that proclamation, whether the intent of Congress or of the president was to create a reserved water right. And that's a decision that needs to be made on a case-by-case evaluation for each particular reservation.\nBINGAMAN: In the case of areas designated as wilderness, do you have a general view as to whether an implied federal reserve water right is intended to be created with the designation of an area as wilderness?\nNORTON: Obviously, it's important for us to preserve wilderness areas and to be sure that those wilderness areas are able to preserve the values that we want to see. One of the issues that I will need to address as secretary of the interior, if I am confirmed, is exactly that issue of water rights in wilderness areas.\nAs you know, the Idaho Supreme Court recently held that Congress did not intend to set aside water rights when it created wilderness areas. And so that decision will be coming up for review.\nI will carefully study that and work with the Department of Justice. Of course, it is their decision as to what position the United States would take. And I will work with them to evaluate that case and determine what the course of action should be following from that.\nBINGAMAN: My time is up.\nSenator Murkowski?\nMURKOWSKI: Thank you very much, Chairman Bingaman.\nAnd again, Ms. Norton, let me welcome you to the committee. I was particularly pleased that you chose to mention the plight of the American Indian reservation and the manner in which the Department of Interior has handled its responsibilities. And I would encourage you to evaluate the system within the Department of Interior in recognizing that there's a great deal of technology and expertise to be contracted for, as opposed to trying to maintain a function that a trust department or a notarized public accounting firm would guide you into expert procedures for reporting back to the individual native tribes, because it is an unbelievable set of circumstances.\nI would also call your attention--as I indicated in my opening statement--to the plight of some of our territories that are going to require your attention. The Virgin Islands--I hope that, Chairman Bingaman, that we can take some of the members down there and see the difficulty and the debt load that those folks are under, and their inability to have any realistic relief, other than the reality that we're going to have to recognize some debt forgiveness, and try and help them restructure. It's a tragedy that's been overlooked. And the same is true in American Samoa. I've been out there, and these are territories that we've simply ignored.\nYou're going to have to bring together, I think, in order to develop a policy that President-elect George W. Bush has indicated, relative to the energy situation in this country. We have lacked a cohesive policy. We've lacked a direction, and I think, partially due to a management style.\nYou know, you've got the Department of Interior that controls land, controls access. Then you've got the Environmental Protection Agency that's concerned, as they should be, with air quality, and environmental sensitivities. And then you've got, say, the Department of Energy. And in many cases, the secretaries have been going different ways, as opposed to coming together to say, \"All right, within the administration, we're going to have to address this crisis.\"\nAnd as we look at the hearing that we held this morning, a good deal of discussion was on California, and the fact that the lights are about out. People are getting stuck in elevators. Traffic lights don't work, in revolving blackouts, which suggests we're going to have to do something about the problem, that somebody's going to have to make some decisions. And that's why I have mentioned a great deal of effort's going to have to go into balancing this process.\nDo you feel that you can bring together, within this new administration, the wherewithal, and the policy-makers to resolve and make some decisions about how we're going to relieve our dependence on imports--56 percent, going up to, we heard this morning, 62 by the year 2004?\nOur greatest source seems to be coming, now, from Saddam Hussein. We fought a war in '92; we lost 147 lives. We can't address what to do with our nuclear waste. Oil prices continue to go up. We're looking towards natural gas, now. We're using it faster than we're finding it.\nYou're going to have to come up with some of these answers, with your collective colleagues. How do you propose to do it?\nNORTON: The issue of Americans being so dependent on foreign oil is, obviously, a great cause for concern. The idea that people in California, this very day, are facing serious shortages of energy, is another great cause of concern. We will have to pull together all of our resources, and work across departmental lines, to find ways of addressing those issues.\nObviously, it's going to be difficult to find short-term answers. We'll have to do a lot of planning to find long-term answers. We would hope to work with you to find the right kinds of solutions that would balance environmental protection, as well as finding ways of providing the kind of energy resources that need to be available.\nMURKOWSKI: I think it's appropriate that I bring up the issue of ANWR, because some would be disappointed if I didn't. And in any event, many members of our environmental community have opposed your nomination, because of the president-elect's position on environmentally responsible oil and gas exploration in that small portion of the Arctic coastal plain, in my state of Alaska. However, the reality is that you, nor the president, currently has the authority to open up this area; only Congress has that authority.\nAnd in this regard, I have two questions for you. If Congress is to undertake the debate on this issue, will you commit to aid those debates with the very best science available from the Department of Interior?\nNORTON: Absolutely. I view the role of the Department of Interior as helping provide the information to this Congress so that you can make an informed decision. We hope to look at the issues of how we can provide the best scientific evaluation of the environmental consequences, how we can do any exploration and production, if it is done, in the absolute most environmentally conscious way that we can have that happen.\nMURKOWSKI: My second question is, if Congress approves a measure to allow exploration and development of the coastal plain and it becomes law, will you uphold the law Congress passes and use all the powers afforded to you to mitigate any potential negative environmental consequences?\nNORTON: I will certainly follow any laws that are passed to be sure that the protection of the important resources of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preserved at the same time that any exploration or production would take place.\nMURKOWSKI: Thank you.\nNow, moving over to Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered 30-some-odd years ago. In the search for oil in Prudhoe Bay--which has been providing this nation with about 20 percent of the total domestic crude oil produced for some 27 years and it's falling off now as Prudhoe Bay declines. But, not looking for it, but as a sidelight, we found some 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Nobody paid much attention to it because of the cost of getting that gas out when gas was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet, which is what it was a year ago. Now gas is $8.40. And as we look at our reserves and the fact that we're pulling down our reserves, there's more and more thought given to marketing that gas.\nIn order for this to become a reality, it's going to take a transportation system. And it's going to require an investment of about $10 billion, the largest single construction product that would be on the horizon and larger than anything that we've undertaken in this country. Should the owners of the gas decide to move forward with such a project, the Department of Interior, through the Joint Pipeline Office, will have an awful lot to say about the permitting and development.\nMy question to you is, if confirmed, will you act, in your role as secretary, to provide all the resources needed to the Joint Pipeline Office in Alaska to help expedite a project of this magnitude, if indeed it becomes a reality?\nNORTON: I'm aware of the important need for natural gas, not just because our economy is expanding and there's more demand for energy, but also because natural gas is seen as one of the ways of having the cleanest supply of energy. So it's important for us to have some mechanisms to be able to draw upon gas resources.\nI will look forward to working with you to learn more about that issue. It's not one that I have had the opportunity, obviously, to discuss the details on. I will look forward to working with you so that we can resolve that issue.\nMURKOWSKI: February or March are a good time for a visit to Prudhoe Bay because you can see it as it really is nine months of the year.\nMy last appeal to you is please come visit us in Glacier Bay. Glacier Bay is the number two tourist destination in our state. Number one is Denali National Park, both of which are maintained by the Park Service.\nBut there seems to be a great reluctance in the Park Service to allow the entries of passenger ships during the season, which is only 90 days of the year, to allow two ships a day so that the visitors can see this. And to suggest that the environmental damage would be more than an occasional cigarette butt that somebody might throw over the side of the ship, it's pretty hard to make a case that there's not a more compatible environmental way to see this beautiful area than by cruise ship. And for the life of me, the Park Service just doesn't want to let access in. And they have no good scientific, justifiable reason.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: Senator Dorgan?\nDORGAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\nAnd Gale Norton, welcome to the committee.\nAs we hear the public debate that occurs on this nomination, it occurs to me that various groups describe two different Gale Nortons. One of them is described as bright and charming, interesting, soft-spoken, confident, reasonable, thoughtful and moderate.\nAnother some describe is a nominee who thinks on the political fringes, favors polluters, cares little about the environment, is unsympathetic to endangered species, is a friend of both lead paint and James Watt. And so, the question is, who's Gale Norton?\nI don't know Gale Norton except to have met you last week. We need to separate the fact from the fiction in this debate. And saying that, I recognize that the spotlights that shine on public lives these day can sometimes offer almost perfect vision and other times offer a pretty warped view of what is real.\nI'm going to ask you a series of questions about things that have been said about you and things that you have said and I'd like to get some response. I kind of feel about the same way as Senator Bingaman feels; I've not made a decision about this nomination, but I do believe that presidents have the opportunity to send us their candidates and we have an opportunity, of course, under the advice and consent responsibility, to ask questions.\nAnd you have a very distinguished record, you've done a lot of things. I'm a graduate of the graduate school of the University of Denver, and I'm pleased to hear that you were on the faculty.\nLet me ask you some questions and I'll try to do a number of them quickly. Global warming: You have written that there is little consensus over whether global warming is occurring. Do you think there is any kind of a scientific consensus at all that there is some significant climate change occurring or global warming occurring?\nNORTON: Thank you very much for the opportunity to begin to reconcile the parts of my record and to have the opportunity to explain myself so that, perhaps, the picture of me that emerges at some point will be a little more clearer.\nGlobal warming is an issue that has seen scientific information developing over time, and the further we go through the process, the more information we have available. The article that you referred to is something that was written several years ago. I will maintain an open mind and receive new scientific information as it is put forward.\nDORGAN: But, my question is, do you think there is a consensus on any side of this issue? Some would say, \"While there are doubters certainly, and some respected doubters, there seems to be a fairly overwhelming consensus among most scientist that something is occurring in the area of global warming.\" Do you share that view?\nNORTON: It does seem, based on my evaluation, which is not a scientific one, that there is beginning to be more of a consensus that global warming is occurring. There is still disagreement as to the causes and the long-term future, and, obviously, there is disagreement about what ought to be done in that regard. I will certainly rely on scientific information as it becomes available and evaluate the information as it is presented to me.\nDORGAN: Thank you. Let me ask you about the issue of the Fifth Amendment takings clause and some of the comments that have been made about your position on that. You have indicated that the government must pay compensation when its actions interfere with private property rights in an article you wrote or speech you gave, and you talked about that may even extend to a property owner's right to pollute. Can you tell us what you meant by that?\nNORTON: The issue of private property rights is something that is important to me, beginning from the time that I worked with farmers and ranchers who feel very strongly about the land that belongs to them, and who care very much as stewards for that land. I think it's important for government to be able to work with the people who feel closest to land and to try to find ways to reconcile with them ways of protecting the environment and allowing people to enjoy their property.\nIn an article, I once was talking about extreme examples of environmental analysis and the analysis of takings laws. The idea of a right to pollute is not something that I support. That was actually a phrase that is taken from some work that I did earlier on the concept of emissions trading. The idea of emissions trading, of the ability to find economic incentive ways of dealing with pollution, is something that early on called an emissions credit a right to pollute, and that is a tradable concept that has now been embodied in the Clean Air Act and it has very mainstream acceptance.\nIt is absolutely not clear from that article that that was the way in which I was using that phrase, and I recognize that. I do not support the concept of the right to pollute as many people have tried to characterize that.\nDORGAN: I'll try to come back to that in the future. But, let me just ask, on the takings issue, you believe that local governments have a right to be involved in zoning? For example, if you have a home in Denver and I buy the lot next door and put up a sheep barn and bring in 2,000 sheep, you have a right to complain about that because I've violated zoning? Or because they say I can't put up a sheep barn and house some sheet next to your house, have they taken something from me?\nNORTON: The concept of zoning and of the way in which we use our property are things that do require an evaluation of property rights. I think it's certainly appropriate for a local government to say you can't put a sheep ranch right next to a residential community.\nDORGAN: And that is not a taking?\nNORTON: That is not a taking. Going back to the ancient aspects of common law, there have always been limits on using property. You cannot use property in a way that harms the property of your neighbor. And that's a concept I wholeheartedly agree with.\nMy view of property rights is, as it applies to the Department of the Interior, what inspires me to want to find ways of working cooperatively with landowners to have incentive-based approaches to encourage them to enhance the habitat on their property or to protect endangered species on their property.\nI think we can find very cooperative ways of working with farmers and ranchers and other landowners that are based on recognition of the importance of property rights and to tie that in with protection of the environment.\nDORGAN: Mr. Chairman, I'm just about out of time.\nLet me--I want to just ask two very brief questions you can perhaps answer them at the same time. One is, do you support the Endangered Species Act? Give me your thoughts about that. And second, can you just briefly describe your feeling about states' rights overriding tribal self-governance rights with respect to Indian nations?\nNORTON: I support the Endangered Species Act and the preservation of endangered species. I've been privileged to work on the protection of species like the California condor, on the endangered fish species in the Colorado River. I think we've seen some accomplishments there that hopefully will allow those species to survive, so I do support that.\nAs to states' rights and tribal sovereignty, those are complex legal questions. It boils down, I think, to the idea that decisions of government are often best made when made closest to the people who are affected by those decisions. And what is true for states is true for tribes. Self-government is very important and I support that as a concept.\nDORGAN: Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time.\nThank you very much for your responses.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you.\nSenator Domenici?\nDOMENICI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nFirst of all, let me say to you that I did not know that you were also a Denver University graduate. I can say it that way because I graduated from their law school a long time before you ever got involved.\nFirst, I want to thank the three public officials who testified on your behalf. I think each one of them contributed in a very special way, two senators first, in, kind of, shedding a view of you that, from my standpoint, I had already arrived at.\nI read most of the attacks and allegations, and then I read the reality of them. And I had already concluded that President Bush wants you to be his secretary of interior and that you ought to have the job; that you see more of what you feel and see and think about public land issues are in tune with his philosophy and that's as it should be.\nIf, as a matter of fact, that does not suit every single senator, then they have prerogatives. But to bring up ideas that would diminish the fact that you can serve him well by doing what he thinks is the right thing, to me does not make any sense; I believe you're entitled to the job.\nAnd I'd like to say I read the newspapers that are associated with your history, that would be the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post. And I'm actually very pleased with both of their editorials. And I would say to anyone that thinks the negative record that is being made here as the other side of Gale Norton that they ought to read these editorials.\nI mean they say, in the first three paragraphs of each one, that you are competent, you're a wonderful legal scholar, you bring people together. And while the environmentalist community does not agree with you on everything, that in many instances, such as the reserved water debate, that you are in tune with the legal issues and that you have indeed been on the right side of most of those issues even if there are some who would not like that view.\nI would ask that those two editorials be made part of the record, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: They'll be included in the record.\nDOMENICI: Now I would say for the record, from this senator's standpoint, I read the Summitsville (ph) mine issue in its entirety. I believe you have done everything appropriate in that regard and the state of Colorado is lucky to have you represent them in that issue.\nAnd now to the third person that testified in your behalf, let me say to the distinguished governor who I've recently had an opportunity to meet, everyone should know I met him in the campaign of George W. Bush, right so there's no doubt about it, we are on the same side.\nAnd I think today, for those who are thinking that there are two sides to this very, scholarly attorney general, I think you have convinced me and you should convince most Americans that you know her best. And the side that you have described as the positive side of her is the real Gale Norton, and I don't think there's any question about it; you did a marvelous job and I thank you.\nNow Madam soon-to-be-Secretary, I would be very upset if you didn't disagree with the secretary of interior who is leaving in some respects and on some issues. As a matter of fact, if you choose to be as mellow about the way you feel about some of his decisions, I might not vote for you.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI mean you ought to honestly tell us that many of the things he has done and that he put on the books of this country are not exactly what George Bush for president wants. But you will comply with the law and hopefully you can make some changes.\nChanges in what? Changes in the endangered species law. Not that it should be abolished, but we are so timid and so frightened, we won't even consider and amendment to it when now, when even the administration and the Republicans agree because somebody is fearful that you shouldn't tinker with that law.\nWell, it's not working very well. If you want to know about it, come down to my state and see how the Bureau of Reclamation is about to determine that our water is all federally controlled because of an endangered species. And we aren't going to let that happen. We don't believe the endangered species, in that case a minnow that's preserved there, that we should let the government run all of our water up and down the Rio Grande, our only real water supply. And we're not going to let that happen.\nAnd I'm very pleased this election occurred because I believe you're not going to let it happen. When you see the equities of that, you're going to work toward some habitat and cut out the fighting that has been going on down there.\nMy last observation is if you weren't willing to take some new views on energy supply, as it pertains to your properties, the properties you will run for all of us, then I would not be voting for you, because I believe we need some changes. We have a detailed report of energy supply from the public domain. It was issued only two months ago. I urge that you read it.\nIt says on properties that have been withdrawn, there are 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It is worth looking at those in light of our energy dilemma when we use 20 trillion a year, that's 10 years supply. There ought to be a darn good reason for locking it up when California got their lights out today and maybe tomorrow they won't have any industry left.\nIn conclusion, I assume you would be willing to be tasked by the president to work on energy issues as you work on the other issues and to look at those in light of your policy decisions; is that correct?\nNORTON: Senator Domenici, I would be proud to work on trying to solve those difficult problems.\nDOMENICI: My last one has to do with Indians. You talked about what you might do and you left out one big thing so I would ask you to include it, because you talked about what the president-elect said. He said to the Indian leaders in New Mexico as a public statement that he would put $1 billion in this year's budget for Indian public schools. And I think you should add that to your testimony. And since he said it, I would hope you would agree that you will support it.\nNORTON: I will strongly support that.\nDOMENICI: What we've got now is a school system where the buildings are falling down. The Indian kids are in buildings we would not have other than Indians in and he wants to get rid of the problem in five or six or seven years. We've been working on it for five or six. I laud him for it and I think you should support that.\nNORTON: The concept of zoning and of the way in which we use our property are things that do require an evaluation of property rights. I think it's certainly appropriate for a local government to say you can't put a sheep ranch right next to a residential community.\nDORGAN: And that is not a taking?\nNORTON: That is not a taking. Going back to the ancient aspects of common law, there have always been limits on using property. You cannot use property in a way that harms the property of your neighbor. And that's a concept I wholeheartedly agree with.\nMy view of property rights is, as it applies to the Department of the Interior, what inspires me to want to find ways of working cooperatively with landowners to have incentive-based approaches to encourage them to enhance the habitat on their property or to protect endangered species on their property.\nI think we can find very cooperative ways of working with farmers and ranchers and other landowners that are based on recognition of the importance of property rights and to tie that in with protection of the environment.\nDORGAN: Mr. Chairman, I'm just about out of time.\nLet me--I want to just ask two very brief questions you can perhaps answer them at the same time. One is, do you support the Endangered Species Act? Give me your thoughts about that. And second, can you just briefly describe your feeling about states' rights overriding tribal self-governance rights with respect to Indian nations?\nNORTON: I support the Endangered Species Act and the preservation of endangered species. I've been privileged to work on the protection of species like the California condor, on the endangered fish species in the Colorado River. I think we've seen some accomplishments there that hopefully will allow those species to survive, so I do support that.\nAs to states' rights and tribal sovereignty, those are complex legal questions. It boils down, I think, to the idea that decisions of government are often best made when made closest to the people who are affected by those decisions. And what is true for states is true for tribes. Self-government is very important and I support that as a concept.\nDORGAN: Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time.\nThank you very much for your responses.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you.\nSenator Domenici?\nDOMENICI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nFirst of all, let me say to you that I did not know that you were also a Denver University graduate. I can say it that way because I graduated from their law school a long time before you ever got involved.\nFirst, I want to thank the three public officials who testified on your behalf. I think each one of them contributed in a very special way, two senators first, in, kind of, shedding a view of you that, from my standpoint, I had already arrived at.\nI read most of the attacks and allegations, and then I read the reality of them. And I had already concluded that President Bush wants you to be his secretary of interior and that you ought to have the job; that you see more of what you feel and see and think about public land issues are in tune with his philosophy and that's as it should be.\nIf, as a matter of fact, that does not suit every single senator, then they have prerogatives. But to bring up ideas that would diminish the fact that you can serve him well by doing what he thinks is the right thing, to me does not make any sense; I believe you're entitled to the job.\nAnd I'd like to say I read the newspapers that are associated with your history, that would be the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post. And I'm actually very pleased with both of their editorials. And I would say to anyone that thinks the negative record that is being made here as the other side of Gale Norton that they ought to read these editorials.\nI mean they say, in the first three paragraphs of each one, that you are competent, you're a wonderful legal scholar, you bring people together.

I laud him for it and I think you should support that.\nThank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield.\nBINGAMAN: Senator Wyden?\nWYDEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd Ms. Norton, thank you for the chance to have visited with you. I believe the American people will vigorously resist the exploitation of public lands by private interests.\nI also believe that they will not resist, and, in fact, will welcome, an interior secretary with creative ideas for forging consensus so as to protect bout our treasures and be sensitive to economic needs.\nAnyone who believes it can't be done ought to just take a look to my right--he likes to say he's always to my right--where Senator Larry Craig sits. He and I worked together to resolve one of the most contentious natural resources issues last session, dealing with timber harvest and payments to rural counties. So it is possible to find consensus on these issues.\nAnd I can tell you as a Westerner, I share the view that one size does not fit all. When you're trying to comply with environmental law, what works in the Bronx may not necessarily work in Prineville, Oregon.\nBut you have to convince me in these hearings, that as you provide flexibility to the states and various other parties, your bottomline will be unwavering: All federal environmental laws must be complied with and you have to enforce them.\nFinally, I will tell you I am concerned about the approach that you have supported in the past with respect to self-policing. Here again, it's a matter of degree. I like the idea of having people come forward and take the initiative but I am a concerned in a number of cases, like Summitville, where that approach was allowed to go on for too long and I hope that you will take a different position.\nNow for purposes of my question, I would like to follow up on what Senator Bingaman asked about in terms of enforcing the law. You said categorically you would and we appreciate that.\nBut I have an article that I'd like to submit for the record from the Denver Post, where when you disagreed with the affirmative action program in Colorado, they had to go out and hire outside counsel to represent the state.\nNow I know absolutely nothing about the affirmation action law in your state. I am against quotas. Affirmative action can certainly be improved. But would you do that again, or have your attitudes changed? Because when you told Senator Bingaman you would carry out the laws of the land as they are written, and I have in front of me the governor having to go out and hire outside counsel to carry out a state statute, that doesn't seem to square.\nNORTON: Senator Wyden, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the questions that you have raised. Let me begin with the last points on affirmative action.\nAs Governor Owens described in his comments--and I thank him for his warm comments toward me--the program in question was not a state law. It was a program that was adopted on a discretionary basis and that program was later held to not comply with the standards established by the federal courts, and so that program was essentially thrown out by the courts.\nAs attorney general, it is my responsibility to advise the agencies of state government and I provided that advice to them. They felt that--and I concurred that it would be stronger for them to have someone else who had not provided the advice that I did to them, and they went forward with a different attorney and they were not successful.\nI think my position on that was vindicated.\nAs to Summitville, I think there has been some misconception that Summitville was an example of self policing. It was not. It was a situation that was a company that did not comply with the laws that were in effect. My office took a very vigorous role in trying to deal with the Summitville mine situation.\nWhen we heard that that company was going into bankruptcy and had plans to just walk away and not operate the water treatment system, that cyanide would be flowing down into the river, we immediately stepped in to get a court order to prevent that from happening. We worked in the bankruptcy courts to obtain as much as we could through that company's bankruptcy to try to use that money for the clean-up process.\nWe cooperated with the EPA, with the other state agencies to try to have a coordinated approach. And as a result of that coordinate approach, working with the states and the federal regulators, we have taken actions to deal with what was a disastrous and awful situation.\nWYDEN: I know you cooperated with the federal government, but my concern is, when it was in your court, my sense is you were slow to deal with the issue.\nAnd, for example, the Denver Post, on November 10 of 1995, took you to task when they said that the environmental task force, of which you worked closely with, was debating whether to extend the statute of limits on environmental crimes. You ultimately decided not to press the issue. They thought you should, rather than take it to the federal government.\nAnd I guess my concern is, as with the answer on affirmative action, I gather there, you felt you would lose, so you shouldn't challenge the law. The law is on the books. On the Summitville, you know, question, I think there was an opportunity for the state to have demonstrated leadership earlier on. And these are some of the philosophical, you know, questions that, I think, need to be explored.\nNow, in your comments to Senator Dorgan, you touched on an area that is very important to my constituents, and that's the Endangered Species Act. And I happen to believe that we can protect these species, and be sensitive to local communities. You challenged the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act in an amicus brief, that you filed in the Sweet Home case. Now, I would like to know whether you would no longer file that brief today, given the opportunity to serve in this position, and whether that's what you meant when you told Senator Dorgan you supported the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act.\nNORTON: Let me first address an unfinished point, as to the Summitville matter. And that is that criminal prosecutions did occur. My office worked with the federal agencies. And yes, we were frustrated by the fact that we had a short statute of limitations. We felt that, in that situation, working through the environmental crimes task force that my office took the initiative in establishing, that it was best for us to work cooperatively with the federal agencies. And that has resulted in, I believe, the strongest possible action being taken against the operator of that mine. We have recovered--and just recently, they've recovered millions and millions of dollars against that operator, that will go into the clean-up of that site.\nAs to the Endangered Species Act, I was involved in a piece of litigation that dealt, primarily, with the interpretation of the act, and how that would be applied. The states of Arizona and Colorado filed a brief in which we've said that it should be interpreted in one way. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that it should be interpreted differently. I will certainly uphold the position taken by the U.S. Supreme Court, and will enforce the Endangered Species Act.\nWYDEN: I have a number of other questions, Mr. Chairman, but the light is on, and I appreciate it.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you very much.\nSenator Craig?\nCRAIG: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\nGale, it is really an honor for all of us to have you before this committee for your confirmation hearings.\nAs the crowd was gathering, I had never seen so many photographers in my life. Now, as a politician, I was extremely jealous.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI mean, I work at trying to get a crowd out like this, and they never come. I couldn't imagine that that crowd had assembled for you. Really, I thought they'd come to see Ben's new bike.\n(LAUGHTER)\nIf you don't know, Ben's got a beautiful new bike that he's going to have in the inaugural parade the day after tomorrow. And it is a gorgeous sight to behold, I'm told. And I was quite confident that's why all of you photographers had assembled. Not the case.\nThe case was that you had been promoted in a way that just does not meet the standards of the record. And it is exciting for me, not only to hear your governor, but your colleagues, your two senators begin to set that record straight. And we have heard repeatedly again, here today, that somehow what has been said about you over the last good number of days, when literally has placed a gag order on your colleagues, simply doesn't seem to match.\nAnd so it's always fun, exciting and appropriate that we have you here to speak in your own words as you are so well doing at this moment on these kinds of issues.\nMy colleague from Oregon, Ron Wyden, mentioned the success that he and I had recently on a piece of legislation that dealt with public lands and communities of interest that had been dramatically depleted of their resources, for schools and counties and roads and bridges over the last decade because we have reduced logging on our national forests by over 80 percent.\nNow, having said that, I am not going to suggest that you come and return to that. But what I am of the belief of, and you've mentioned at least three times in your statements, and I've kept track. You've used the word \"collaborative.\" That is an exciting term that the national preservationists shutter at. Ron Wyden and I implemented it for local communities to begin to work together with all the stakeholders of interests at those local community levels to resolve the current crisis and the relationship between economies and local communities and public lands around them.\nNow, the reason the national preservationists don't like that term, and the reason the photographers have assembled today, and the reason the word has gone out about you, is that they are losing their top-down authority to control the way decisions are made without public participation, without the collaborative process, and, most importantly, without this community or this committee of jurisdiction.\nI find it interesting, Gale, that your predecessor, who is soon to be leaving his office, treated this authorizing committee in this way. He said it is, \"a highly partisan debating society staffed by munchkins that wrangle a lot.\" Now, I know that aggregated the \"H\" out of me, and my guess is if you continued to treat us like your predecessor has, it would begin to aggregate the heck out of my colleagues on the other side.\nYou see, collaboration not only is important for local communities of interest today, it is extremely important for all of us, working with you to arrive, under the law, at the way we resolve these public land disputes when they occur, but, most importantly, to establish long-term policy that impacts our states and these valuable lands and the treasures upon them.\nAs you know, yesterday the president, again in great pride and gesture, announced new monuments. Let me tell you, briefly, the story of one that occurred in Idaho in the last few weeks. It is to recognize internment camps where Japanese-Americans were held during World War II. It was a time in our nation's history we will not repeat and we are embarrassed about. And, that area, an internment camp in Minidoka County, south central Idaho, should be recognized. I agree on the whole of the delegation, and our governor agreed.\nHerein lies the problem. And as I describe it to you, you will know all so well why I had to publicly oppose the designation, not the intent, not the purpose, and not the value.\nWe were told it was going to happen; some 70,000 acres set aside for the designation. I said to the gentleman at Interior and the Council of Environmental Equality, \"Do you realize that within your area there is an irrigation canal and a right of way for that canal for the Minidoka irrigation district? Do you realize there is also a road right of way? And that you're creating a new level of bureaucracy and a whole new relationship that this irrigation district and road right of way, county in this instance, will have to establish with the National Park Service? If you move your lines a little bit and you adjust a little bit, you can still have the purpose, but you avoid the conflict.\"\nThere answer was basically they didn't care. They wouldn't hold a public hearing. They wouldn't listen to the public. They wouldn't incorporate the interest of the broader area to adjust the boundaries to avoid the conflict. They seemed to be an awful lot interested in politics and not very interested in local involvement and collaboration and, if you will, a rather democratic process.\nSo it is exciting to me that you would use the word \"collaborative.\" Oh, it's inflammatory, because it suggests that all of us ought to be involved in decision-making on the resources of our public lands.\nI find it also interesting that you're being attacked over state's rights and Tenth Amendment issues. We are not a democracy. We are a representative republic. We are a union of states. And we are still that, even though some would like to deny that. And that means that states should and must have equal standing when it comes to deliberations that involve them, their resources and their people. And somehow over the last eight years, we've just forgotten all about that. Or at least some have who preside within the Beltway of this city.\nYou and I may differ a little bit on states rights. But I think we understand the relationships; the value of states and governors and our responsibility to them, but also our responsibility to the nation and to the resources involved.\nI look forward to working with you. I think you will be confirmed by a large and substantial vote of the United States Senate because the billing that you're getting isn't holding up. The record will set you free, because it is an outstanding record of service to the public, service to the resources and to the environment that we all love.\nI thank you for your willingness to commit yourself to what you have committed to for the next four years. And I'm confident that we will have a collaborative working relationship that involves both Democrats and Republicans, that we will not see king-like actions being dictated to us by a Bush administration recognizing that all of us ought to have a piece of the action. That's the way our country works in a republic through a democratic process.\nThank you for being with us.\nNORTON: Thank you.\nBINGAMAN: Senator Graham?\nGRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd welcome, Ms. Norton.\nI would like to talk some about the issue that Senator Craig has just explored, and that is collaboration. And my particular interest is your views on the role of the states and the federal government, and particularly the department that you've been nominated to head, in the management of natural resources which are either within that state or adjacent to that state.\nCould you give us some general statement of your philosophy of what should be the role of the states in determining uses of natural resources that are in properties owned by the federal government but either within or adjacent to those states?\nNORTON: Thank you, Senator Graham. The very difficult issues of trying to manage public lands are best illuminated by the information that comes from the people who know those lands the best. The federal government, obviously, has control of its lands, and constitutionally it is the federal government that makes the decision about those lands. And there's no mistake that it is Congress and the federal government that have control over those issues.\nWe ought to have, though, a cooperative working relationship with the states. And when decisions are made in a way that involves the states, those I think are the best decisions in the long run.\nA few years ago, I worked with Senator Hank Brown, when he was in your midst, on the issue of wilderness areas in the state of Colorado. As state attorney general, I worked with him in trying to deal with some of the water issues that came from the designation of that wilderness area. And we worked with environmental groups and local governments, trying to find the best way of handling those issues that was really tailored to what we needed in Colorado to be able to preserve our wilderness.\nNORTON: What you need in Florida is, obviously, different than what we needed in Colorado. There are no one-size-fits all solutions. So I would hope to work with the states to be able to find the things that would best fit each state.\nGRAHAM: Well, I am pleased at that response. The particular issue--or application of that issue that I'm concerned with is the use of the Outer Continental Shelf which is adjacent to our state. For 20 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations here and in Tallahassee, if there has been one issue which has united our state it is an appreciation for the potential vulnerability of both our environment and our economy to oil and gas development in that Outer Continental Shelf. For approximately 20 years, the Congress has repeatedly passed a series of moratoriums against any additional grant of leases in that--off the coast of Florida.\nI was concerned when I saw an item issued by the National Ocean Industries Association urging the Minerals Management Service to include offshore moratoria regions in the agency's next five-year Outer Continental Shelf leasing program. Could you comment as to what you feel should be the significance of a state's determination in opposition to further Outer Continental Shelf leasing in areas adjacent to that state?\nNORTON: Consistent with the idea of trying to take into account the wishes of local communities, President-elect Bush has made clear that he supports continuing the moratorium on offshore leasing, as to California and as to Florida where the states have opposed that offshore activity.\nThere are, as you know, some areas that are not covered by that because the process has already taken place. And those issues will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\nGRAHAM: Would you believe that if other states, such as North Carolina, which has taken a similar position, would be accorded the same treatment that California and Florida would be accorded?\nNORTON: We would work with the officials from those states to try to reach an appropriate solution.\nGRAHAM: During the administration of the first President George Bush, there was not only the continuation of the moratorium on existing leases, but a buy-back program for leases, particularly in the area of the Florida Keys. Would you support an expansion of that lease repurchase program to other areas adjacent to states which have taken a position similar to Florida?\nNORTON: That, Senator, is an issue that I will have to explore more and learn more about as I move into the position of secretary, if I am confirmed. I will be happy to work with this committee and with you to try to resolve that issue.\nGRAHAM: All right. I would hope that, early on in your administration, that we would have the opportunity to sit down and develop a plan that would be acceptable to the administration and to the states affected for that purpose of eliminating the threat that is represented by leases, many of which are many years old, to the environment and economy of those states.\nThere is an immediate issue now and that is a proposal for the grant of a drilling permit on one of those leases in the vicinity of Pensacola, Florida. Would you plan to work with the--with my state and other states that might be subject to such a potential drilling to assure that the wishes of the state are fulfilled?\nNORTON: Yes, Senator Graham. I would be quite interested in working with those states and in learning more information about that issue so that we can make a good decision.\nGRAHAM: When we met in my office, we talked about some of your principles as they relate to private property rights, and I tried to suggest a few hypothetical cases in order to elucidate how those principles might apply in a reality case.\nIf I could suggest another of those hypotheticals, assume that the unfortunate situation should occur that a drilling permit were to be granted for one of these currently outstanding leases. The effect of doing so would have an adverse effect on the value of private property adjacent to where those wells might be drilled. It would also have an adverse effect on commercial activities, such as hotels and motels. Would you support federal compensation for commercial and private owners who experienced a reduction in the value of their property as a result of the federal government first granting the leases and then granting the drilling permits to utilize those leases?\nNORTON: Senator, it's important to realize the impact of any federal action on the people who are affected by it. There are legal standards for determining when compensation is appropriate. And that kind of situation is probably not the, sort of, situation where direct compensation is normally paid under the court system. The issue of compensation is usually a legal issue that depends upon the statues and the court analysis.\nWe also need to bear in mind that sometimes ways of trying to compensate people, whether that is direct compensation or whether it's ways of trying to mitigate harms that are caused by an action, are also things that ought to be taken into account from a policy perspective in trying to be sure that, when we have a benefit to society, the burdens of that are appropriately and fairly spread across other people within society.\nTo the extent that there are impacts upon people who are affected by a government program, whether it's people in Florida in the kind of situation that you describe, or whether it is people in the West who are affected by government decisions about federal lands, those are things we ought to take into account. And we ought to look at the whole range of different ways of trying to make sure that everyone is as satisfied as we can have with the decisions that are made.\nGRAHAM: Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I'd like the next round to come back and pursue this a little further. Thank you.\nBINGAMAN: Very good.\nSenator Campbell?\nCAMPBELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nGale, have you read the papers lately and read some of the paid-for advertisements that have been put in the paper about how bad you are?\nNORTON: I've seen a few of those unfortunately.\nCAMPBELL: Did it hurt your feelings?\nNORTON: Well, I have to say it doesn't hurt my feelings that much because it doesn't sound like me.\nCAMPBELL: It didn't sound like you to me, either. But I have to tell you, I was--as one who was in that pool for interior for a while, am I glad you got it.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMy wife's particularly glad you got it. I am seriously glad because I know you could do a better job than I could anyway.\nMy colleagues have talked about a lot of things. I want to focus just a little bit on Indian issues, since I'm the chairman of that committee. And one in particular that you're familiar with and you've worked on yourself for years and years the so-called Animus Laplata.\nYears ago when secretary--the last secretary came in for his confirmation, he made a commitment that he would do everything he could to get that built. But unfortunately because the environmental community did sue under the Endangered Species Act, everybody over there in Interior went kind of limp and lost their spine and decided not to pursue it.\nAnd so we had to redo the whole thing and Senator Bingaman, Senator Allard and I worked--and Senator Domenici, the four of us worked hard on this revised bill that you're now familiar with that the president recently signed as part of the omnibus package. I just wanted to get your commitment that you're going to do the best you can to get that thing built.\nAs you know, in 1988, when we first passed it, it was supposed to be built by the year 2000. And if we did not, the tribes would have the opportunity to go back and pursue a lawsuit against the federal government. They signed off on the lawsuit. We actually paid them to give up that lawsuit on condition we build it. We paid them and the thing wasn't built.\nWell, under this new bill now we're off on a whole new direction and hopefully we'll get it built. And we wrote the bill as tight as we could but there's no doubt in my mind the environmental community do not want any compromise or consensus. They want to kill that project, end of story. They want to kill that project.\nThey're already talking about going back to court and saying that the Justice Department was involved with discussions and a whole bunch of other things to try to stop it in the courts again. I would hope in your tenure that we'd have a little more courage over there and not just simply knuckle under the first threat of the environmental community going back to sue to stop that project again.\nIt's the right thing to do. The states of Colorado and New Mexico have collectively spent over $50 million on building water projects, pipelines as their part of the agreement. We've given the tribes over $57 million. In fact, there'll be $10 more million under this bill; it goes to them as part of the agreement to get them to relinquish some of their rights. And we know, those who have worked on it, it's the right thing to do. But we have not been able to get the past administration to show some courage and get that thing built. I would hope you would do that.\nNORTON: Senator, as you well know, the history of Animus Laplata reflects so much of the tragic history that American tribes have faced in the past. There was a settlement reached. It was approved by Congress. And yet that settlement was completely disregarded when it came time to really carry through.\nAs the attorney general of Colorado, I looked at that from the issue of the water rights for the tribes, and warned that we would be back in litigation that would go on for decades if we did not keep some of the commitments that had been made to the tribes. And I support the efforts that you have engaged in and I personally participated in meetings that if it had the attendance of the number of people here today who are concerned about Animus Laplata and about trying to reach further resolution of the issues in a way that would carry forward the commitment to the tribes.\nAnd I look forward to working with you to be sure that we can follow through now that Congress has reached a resolution.\nCAMPBELL: Well, we detailed in some depth in this bill all of the environmental things that we've complied with. In fact, we've complied with everything that we had to from the federal level, and so that will be in your corner if you have to end up in court defending the thing.\nLet me also mention that Senator Domenici talked a little bit about the president's commitment to Indian school construction. I was with him when the president made that commitment in Las Cruces in front of 13 tribal chairmen. He did commit $920 million to $1 billion the first year that he's in office.\nAnd Senator Dorgan has taken the lead many times around this place in committee and on the floor too talking about just the horrendous conditions of Indian schools where children are expected to learn with broken windows and drafty walls and just unbelievably unsanitary and dangerous conditions. They can't learn in conditions like that. It's as simple as that. They can't.\nAnd I'm just very pleased that the president-elect has made a commitment to doing something about that construction. But that construction will come through your department, and so I just wanted to alert you to that. And I would hope you would support that, too.\nNORTON: That has my wholehearted personal commitment.\nCAMPBELL: Thank you.\nAnd last, Senator Murkowski and I spent a good number of hours and, in fact, even introduced a bill to try to straighten out this mess with the trust assets that you're aware of, this missing $2.5 billion that I mentioned in my opening statement. The administration opposed that bill, and we couldn't get the thing moving because they think for some reason there they have the expertise to be able to do it.\nBut just yesterday, in the Denver Post, there was another article, another story about how they are not straightening it up. It is still a mess. I mean they've got--they estimate over 100,000 missing documents. They've got documents stored in trash bags and old cardboard boxes full of rat feces in warehouses in New Mexico and around the country. And I just am still not sure that they're going to be able to straighten it up in-house.\nBut I would hope you would also make that a priority and work with Chairman Murkowski and Senator Bingaman and I, who are all very concerned about that.\nNORTON: It's alarming to hear that we have such large amounts of money that ought to belong to the Indian people themselves that has become lost somewhere in the bureaucracy of the Department of the Interior. And I will do what I can to work to straighten that out. I will work with this committee to try to find the best way to resolve that so that we can see that it's all straightened out at some point in the future.\nCAMPBELL: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: Senator Bayh?\nBAYH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd Ms. Norton, thank you for being with us. I want to express my appreciation for the courtesy you paid me of coming to visit and acknowledge that we have several friends in common who I have a great deal of respect for, including the former attorney general of our state, who I happen to be having dinner with tonight. So maybe I'll continue my queries with him this evening over dinner.\nLet me just give to you my framework that I would ordinarily apply for hearings like this in making decisions on confirmations like this. I customarily would feel that the president is entitled to a great deal of deference in choosing members of his Cabinet for a couple of reasons; first at that in most circumstances would express support for the will of the American people as demonstrated by at least a plurality in the recent election.\nAnd secondly, because the remedy for public policy disputes is almost always or almost always should be take it to the next election. If you have a difference of opinion, take it to the voters. Let them decide.\nThere'd be a caveat for that, though, when it would come to examples of public policy that might have long-lasting consequences not susceptible of being remedied in the next election or anytime soon.\nSo just to give you, sort of, the parameters of my thinking it would be short-run policy differences, take it to the next election; long-term consequences for policy changes not susceptible of remedy anytime soon, maybe not quite as much deference in those sorts of cases.\nSo with that as a background, I'd like to start by asking you some questions of broad policy or philosophy and then get to a couple of specific examples. And I'm going to start by--Ben had to leave but I think, and Governor Owens, several others alluded to some of the ads that have been running, to some of the characterizations comparing you to Mr. Watt and that kind of thing. Those sorts of things, I want to make clear, are unfortunate.\nAnd from our personal interaction, I can tell you're a very--a person with a very pleasant demeanor and conciliating manner which I think is good. I don't know Mr. Watt so I can't speak to him, but some people have said there's a stylistic difference.\nMy concern is more of a substantive nature. Based upon his actions when he headed this department or some of the positions he's taken publicly or in the institute that he helped to found, can you give us an example of an important public policy with which you disagree with Mr. Watt?\nNORTON: Senator, that is difficult for me in a respect that you might find surprising. And that is, I don't know everything that Jim Watt thinks about issues. I have only, really, spoken with him once in the last 10 years. I am not in constant communication with him and discussion of policy issues.\nI think we might have issues in common, but in the 20 years since I worked at Mountain States Legal Foundation at the same time Jim Watt did, I've had a lot of different experiences.\nMy experiences at Mountain States Legal Foundation were in defending some wonderful people of the west, defending ranchers and farmers and small business people who were very earnest about the things that they did and who, in good faith, really felt strongly about their land and their ability to make decisions.\nSince that time, I've also had the opportunity, as attorney general, to deal with people who did not have that kind of a regard, to deal with people who thumbed their noses at the environmental laws, who flagrantly violated those laws. Those people, some of them are spending time in prison because of our prosecution of them. We recovered tens of millions of dollars in fines and penalties against those who violated Colorado's laws.\nI think the reality of who I am is different from the characterization of who Jim Watt his. I mean him no disrespect, but I am my own person.\nBAYH: Thank you. I think you know that some of Ray's questions want to draw analogies between you and Mr. Watt because of your association long ago and you can understand why they would--I think you answered my question sufficiently and I appreciate that. But I think you can understand why they would be looking for, perhaps, some specifics to say, \"Look, I wouldn't be like him,\" or the philosophy in some particular respects. I recommend that to you.\nSecondly, again from a broader philosophical term, you've been an eloquent spokesperson for the rights of individuals, of states, of businesses. As a former governor, I can certainly--the interests of states certainly resonates with me. You've expressed some doubt about some different federal statues, the Endangered Species Act, the Surface Mining Act, the Clean Air Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act.\nMy question would be that if there is not a compelling national interest in these cases, when would you find--when is there a compelling national interest in protecting the American people in these or other areas? And philosophically speaking, when should the national interest predominate?\nNORTON: As an attorney who has dealt with constitutional issues, and dealt with those issues from the perspective of a state attorney general and as someone who has represented other states as an attorney, I look at the ways in which laws are structured. Because I might disagree with the way in which a law is structured and the kinds of mandates it puts onto a state, I don't necessarily disagree with the goals of those laws.\nI support the endangered species goals of preserving and protecting endangered species. I think that mining operations ought to be reclaimed as the Surface Mining Reclamation Act requires. I think that we ought to provide opportunities for people with disabilities. In fact, the second law review article I ever wrote was about providing access to mass transportation for those with handicaps.\nThere are many things where we may disagree about the ways in which laws are structured where the states might like to see more control in their own ability to make decisions; the federal government might like to see more control lodged with it. But there is a broad national consensus behind those laws and that should not dissuade us from pursuing the goals of those laws. And where...\nBAYH: Your concern was not that there was not a legitimate national interest or even that national legislation was inappropriate, it was simply in the specifics, the details of the different acts?\nNORTON: There are often times ways in which the federal government can reach the same result in two different ways.\nAnd one of those results can impact very heavily on the states, and cause problems for states in being able to implement it, while another way of reaching that same endpoint is one that allows the states and the federal government to work cooperatively together. I've tried to work for those areas where that kind of cooperation can take place.\nBAYH: Thank you. I'd also--is there a light? I don't want to go on and on here, over my time, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: You have 13 seconds.\nBAYH: Thirteen seconds--ah, well, I can't do more in that amount of time, Ms. Norton, than thank you again, and say that, perhaps in a round of questioning, tomorrow--and I apologize for having to slip out--we've got multiple balls we're trying to keep in the air, around here. But I noted that Senator Graham was asking about some aspect of takings. And I'm interested in some of your thoughts about that, perhaps we can pursue in the next round of questioning.\nBut again, I appreciate your presence here, today, and your visit, and your willingness to address our questions. Thank you.\nBINGAMAN: Senator Thomas?\nTHOMAS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nIt's an interesting--welcome, Gale. So nice to have you here. It's interesting how sometimes you're asked to differentiate yourself from mountain states, but seldom do we ask others to differentiate themselves from the League of Conservation voters. It would be something we probably ought to try.\nI agree with my friend from New Mexico, that you know, we need to take some different approaches to resolving the problems that are involved in resource management. Taking a different approach than a previous secretary in solving these problems, however, doesn't preclude concern for our natural resources. And I think that's what you've said. For the last eight years, this previous administration, the relationship between the agency and the people in the West, has been pretty marked by mistrust. And I think we need to change that.\nIt's time, I believe, for a new chapter in the Department of Interior, which reflects cooperation, as we search for conservation goals, and public access, which, I think, is one of the things.\nI'm particularly interested, as you know, in parks. In our last budget, the administration put more emphasis and more dollars into acquisition than they did on maintenance. And yet we talk a lot about backlogs, which are real, and we need to do something about that. Would you support a plan, and the management necessary to carry out a plan, to maintain the current needs, and pick up on those needs, in order to safeguard our parks?\nNORTON: Senator Thomas, I was very surprised to learn that, despite the fact that we have an almost $5 billion backlog in maintenance and care for our national parks, the outgoing administration cut back on the budget for maintenance of our parks. I think it's very important--and President-Elect Bush has made clear, that it is very important to him--that we adequately maintain our national treasures.\nTHOMAS: I certainly agree. One of the issues, of course, in states that are 50, 60 percent owned by the federal government, is the question of multiple use. It's very important. We've talked about it, generally. How would you, sort of, intend to guide the Park Service and Bureau of Land Management with regard to access and multiple use of those resources?\nNORTON: I value the preservation of our lands. And I value the ability of people to use those lands in an appropriate way. Now, you recognize that where we come from, in the West, often the only way to effectively live people's lives is to have access to the public lands. When vast portions of many of our states are owned by the federal government, the ability to have access to those federal lands is very important. And I will work to be sure that, again, those local issues are resolved with an eye to what makes sense on a local basis, in trying to figure out those things on a collaborative basis that are going to work best in each of those states.\nTHOMAS: I can't resist a follow-up, on an issue that's now involved in Yellowstone and Teton, with respect to snow machines in the winter. I don't think anyone suggests that we continue to do what's been done, in terms of the machines, in terms of the noise, in terms of the exhaust. But, in fact, rather than to seek to find clean machines, to change the management, why the department has just wanted to terminate that kind of access. What would you think about taking a look at seeing if it couldn't be changed, so that access, and preservation of the resources couldn't go together?\nNORTON: I've been out cross-country skiing in the quiet of a snowy day in the forest and had snowmobiles go by, and I know that people can be disturbed by that. I also know that wildlife can be disturbed by snowmobiles. But I'm hopeful there are ways that we can reconcile those issues.\nI would look forward to working with you, to see if there are avenues of trying to allow us to use our resources so that all of that can be satisfied.\nTHOMAS: There's an interesting--and the process is more the issue, than called Jack Morrow Hills in Wyoming. And they studied for about three years, in terms of EIS and the NEPA project, to figure out how to handle it. They came up, after all the public input, and so on, with some plans. And then the secretary arrived, took a look at it, and suggested a different plan, and they discarded all that's been done.\nNow, this is pretty destructive to the NEPA process, and to the EIS process. Do you think that's an appropriate way to deal with those kinds of issues?\nNORTON: Obviously, I'm not familiar with the details of that particular situation. But we would hope to use correctly the processes that call for scientific study and public input, to reach the right, kind of, well-thought-out result.\nTHOMAS: We've delved again, in the endangered species, for 10 years, at least, on de-listing grizzly bears. And all the scientists have indicated that there is, indeed, numbers that exceed what the plan was. The difficulty is, of course, designing some, sort of, rules on habitat. In any event, it's gone on forever. And I've suggested, and will probably introduce again, the proposition, where when you list an endangered species, you also have to have a plan for recovery, so that there is some effort to--which is the purpose of endangered species, is to find recovery. But it just goes on and on. What's your reaction to that?\nNORTON: Well, I would look forward to working with you to study that issue in more detail.\nTHOMAS: Well, it's a tough one.\nWe also--I'm sharing all our little problems with you--wild horses. It's, you know, pretty clear, when you have any critters out on a range of some kind, there's a limit to how much grazing there can be, and how many units can be there. But--and, of course, in years past, why, they starved to death, or whatever, which we don't want them to do now. We haven't seemed to be able to come up, despite a lawsuit--which was in favor of doing some limitation--to finding a solution. It just seems like we need to commit ourselves to coming up with an answer, and getting the question resolved.\nI don't know that I expect an answer, but I do want to share that situation with you, and I hope you'll take a look at it.\nI'm excited about your opportunity to be interior secretary, and certainly I'm delighted that you're here. And thank you.\nNORTON: Thank you.\nBINGAMAN: Senator Smith?\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMs. Norton, welcome to this committee. In 2002, one of the loveliest places in the state of Oregon is going to celebrate a 100th anniversary. It is the Crater Lake National Park. Can you commit to me today, that we will have an appropriate celebration, and that Ron Wyden and I will be invited?\n(LAUGHTER)\nNORTON: I would be happy to see Senator Wyden and you, Senator Smith, at that.\nSMITH: Gale, I appreciated the chance to visit with you the other day. And I think I mentioned to you, my hope that you would find a way to enforce our environmental laws, to keep an environmental stewardship, but that you would remember a human stewardship that we have as well.\nI commend to you a model that the Oregon delegation--Republican and Democrat alike--pursued with Bruce Babbitt, that separated our state from, as far as I know, all the others, in terms of these national monuments that have been designated. We found a way to create 170,000 acres of wilderness in the high Steens. And we did it without destroying the economy of Harney County. We respected the heritage of the people that were there, that are there. And I think it's a credit to the joint goal that we ought to have of leaving the environment better, but remembering that people count in the environment as well.\nAnd I could go over tons of local issues, like the Umatilla Project, where we exchange water--we leave water in rivers. So many creative things can be done if we just work together, instead of yell at each other. The Oregon Salmon Plan, our governor developed that with a Republican legislature.\nSMITH: It has not had any standing in the environmental community because it's not driven by Washington, D.C.\nA lot of things can work if we will start working together. And I hope you will bring that spirit to this job. I have reason to believe you will.\nI am going to submit a written question to you about fiber optic facilities on public land and I hope you will give us a response on that. It will require a more detailed answer than you're probably able to do now. But it matters a great deal to fiber optics spreading throughout the West and how the BLM and the Forest Service respond to those.\nI would like to quote in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, a person that I know is more than just a Democrat, a person I know is something different than just a committed environmentalist, a person that I know is more than just a Coloradan--his name is Representative Mark Udall. I know him as a cousin. My mother is Jessica Udall.\nMark Udall said and I quote, \"She is articulate, highly intelligent and hard working. She is certainly knowledgeable about natural resource law and is regarded as someone who can work effectively in a bipartisan way.\"\nIt's good enough for Mark; it's good enough for this Udall. And I hope my colleagues will vote for you in a bipartisan way.\nAnd I noted with interest this rag with your--half of your face on it and I thought back to my own political experience in seeing things like this. I even saw one about my colleague Senator Wyden, because he did a bill with Representative Craig, by some of these same outfits. And I've got to tell you it's not helpful, because it isn't true. This at best fall of half-truths, and, in fact, I believe it is a gross defamation of a public servant.\nI look forward to casting an enthusiastic vote for you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you.\nSenator Burns?\nBURNS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would ask that my full statement be made part of the record and...\nBINGAMAN: It will be made part of the record.\nBURNS: Gale, thank you for stepping forward and doing this, because public service is very good service, and you've chosen to do it in a very difficult area in time of a need of where we have to reevaluate some things that happened with our natural resources.\nIt seems as though the last administration, they did not manage resources and it seems like their policies intentionally set up areas where there will be conflicts, and so they managed conflicts. And I like your approach much better, that we manage our resources and we also do at the local level.\nI was interested in remarks of my friend from Oregon, Senator Smith, because he is coming on the Commerce Committee and I chair communications. I've always held that just because a kid is born in Rifle, Colorado, or Jordan, Montana, or Embler (ph), Oregon, remote as those areas are, those kids deserve the benefit of distance learning and the same educational opportunities as those who are born in more urban areas and have a broader spectrum of curriculum.\nWe have been denied--and when you hit the word access, that is key, because of not only the siting of powers for wireless, broad-band access to the Internet, or ability to interact in distance education with our learning centers like, in his case, Oregon and Oregon State and our University of Montana, and Montana State and our other Rocky Mountain College and MSUB, but access to actually use those lands as a connector of communities. And I think that's what we're all about is bringing communities together, not only the guise of education, but also how we interact on environmental problems, how we deliver and manage health care for our elderly that live in those remote areas because we know that is changing every day. Telemedicine is a real part of the fabric of each one of us in our small communities. So I'm very, very excited about your approach to those kind of issues and how they serve rural America.\nI am not blessed with a great urban area in the state of Montana. I said this morning I represent a state that has a great deal of dirt between light bulbs...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... and we have to deal with that. And our--if you look from Eureka, Montana, to Alzada, Montana, it is further than it is as the crow flies from Chicago to Washington, D.C. And those people deserve all of the benefits that this free land offers and they should have them.\nAnd through that is through this thing of communications. I've always been on the Commerce Committee. I have worked in this area of communications and distance learning and tele-medicine and those areas of hooking communities together to where we can solve problems in those areas. So I welcome your approach.\nI, too, have been fallen victim to the Antiquities Act. I am sure that we can work together on some of this area because it has taken--in some areas which I think is very sensitive to those people that live in that area--everybody in Washington, D.C., and I regard this place as 17 square miles of logic-free environment.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut we are hammered by groups that do not believe that the people that live along the Missouri River or in eastern Montana or the western Dakotas have faces. What about their next generation? What about their kids and their kids and their grandkids?\nWhat about our Native Americans that are on our reservations that we can't even build schools for and build water systems? And I've been very lucky, I've got two big water systems going in on the Rocky Boy and the Fort Peck--the basic thing of water.\nAnd Gale, your approach, as was mentioned awhile ago about water, how many of us have created a vision of what will this country look like in 2015, 2020, 2030 and our demand for fresh water and where will we get it? Water management, as in spectrum management, as in management of hooking together communities.\nI think that is part of our responsibility here is to be a part of vision. It doesn't hurt to stop and dream a little bit and to think where we want to be in 20 years. So--and I think you've thought that out.\nI thank you for your visit. I thank you for your visit with our group down there. We're just a rogue group, but nonetheless, we appreciate your commitment to what we think are the values that I think all Americans embrace.\nAnd so I appreciate--national parks; we are behind. Glacier and Yellowstone and you know, the area in between in one of our greatest resources in the state of Montana. We want to maintain that as we build the Going to the Sun Highway and we do some things on infrastructure that allows people to enjoy that tremendous view, and a tremendous uplifting of American values that is represented in the grandeur of those two parks. So we really appreciate you.\nAnd I was taken by Senator Graham who wanted to make sure you wanted to honor the moratorium of no offshore drilling as far as the state of Florida was concerned. And I'm sure that the senator from California is also concerned about the same thing. I would also ask them if they would support us if my state wants access for exploration and management of our natural resources. We want access, so ours is another request. If we honor theirs, will they honor ours? And I think that's a logical question.\nAnd thanks again for coming, and I'm going to support you wholeheartedly and I look forward to working with your department and working with Ben Campbell. And we've done some great things for reservations. We've got water settlements to do and we must do that and deal with the area of jurisdiction to make sure that every people, all of the people who live on reservations, are represented evenly and fairly.\nAnd thank you for coming.\nNORTON: Thank you .\nBURNS: If you want to respond to that, I don't know--you may.\n(LAUGHTER)\nNORTON: I think I will let your statement speak for itself. And thank you very much.\nBURNS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you.\nSenator Cantwell, you will ask the final set of questions.\nCANTWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that opportunity, being the new member on the committee.\nAnd Ms. Norton, welcome to the committee. Again, I have heard compliments by former colleagues of yours, our attorney general. So I appreciate your work.\nObviously, the secretary of interior is a very significant position for our entire country, but has a significant impact on the Pacific Northwest. So I would like to--I know there's been a lot of conversation, dialogue about your statements, but I actually was curious about your thoughts on a comment that President-elect Bush made recently. It was in the New York Times on the 14th of this month, in which he said, \"I understand the Western mentality and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration.\"\nHe went on to say that, \"We've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity to reverse the actions Mr. Clinton has taken in the waning weeks of his presidency.\"\nSo I wanted to get your thoughts about that comment because, obviously, I look at the Western mentality maybe from a little bit different perspective although I don't think that means that I have munchkins working as my staff, or I'm joining the debate society here. I just believe, for many parts of Washington state, where we've had explosive growth, that those environmental policies have allowed us to grow and preserve a great quality of life.\nIn fact, the last five years I've spent hiring a lot of people in a company that grew from about 15 in five years to over 1,000 and I can tell you that one of the number one questions they asked was about the environmental quality in the Northwest. In fact, had to convince a candidate at one point in time to join the company because we really did have urban growth boundaries in the state of Washington and the Puget Sound area to protect the quality of life, and the state that that person was coming from didn't have those urban growth boundaries.\nSo to me the Western mentality means also preserving a great quality of life and I know that that's a hard challenge.\nMy specific questions come on two areas where the Northwest has managed, because of these policies, to implement good plans. And the first of that is under the Endangered Species Act, the Habitat Conservation Plans. In fact I was just in the state last week and heard from some of the timber industry, who wanted to brief me on now much success they had made under those HCPs.\nSo my first question is, do you plan to request the necessary funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service so that those HCPs and further HCPs, the Habitat Conservation Plans, can continue to be implemented?\nNORTON: Thank you for that question. President-elect Bush has said that he very much values the efforts being made to preserve the salmon, and it's certainly consistent with the philosophy that I have discussed of trying to work with the locals to recognize the important efforts that have gone into the Pacific Northwest efforts to maintain the salmon population.\nAnd while I don't know all of the specifics about that, that's something I certainly plan to study if I am confirmed as secretary of the interior.\nBut I do know that President-elect Bush has made clear his desire to work towards the efforts recognized by the governors of the states affected by the salmon issues in the Pacific Northwest to try to have preservation of the salmon.\nCANTWELL: The--thank you for that answer. The second question is similar situation where I feel like we've made great progress. We would have--on protection of the Hanford Reach, that was designated. I know you had some questions earlier about the Antiquities Act. But our community was working well before the development of that as a national monument trying to work out an agreement. And so there had been a lot, in fact, there had been developed a local plan.\nSo while not 100 percent consensus, there had been a local plan. So in that regard, this is a particular area playing a vital role on salmon recovery and has--covers over 195,000 acres of the last undammed stretch of the Columbia River. So, in thinking about moving forward, in some of the statements, what will you do to make sure that we preserve that as a national monument? And will you commit to not making any changes in that unless consulting with the Northwest delegation?\nNORTON: Well, I, again, look forward to learning more about that. I'm not really familiar with that particular area and with what the status of that area is. So, I'll look forward to learning more from you about that.\nCANTWELL: So is that something that we could get a comment--again, not to take the rest of the remaining few minutes of the committee's time, but is that something we could get a comment giving you more details on, because it is a project that we would want to know your support of?\nNORTON: We could certainly look at providing some comments for the record on that--some written comments.\nCANTWELL: Thank you very much.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for that indulgence.\nBINGAMAN: Thank you very much.\nWe'll plan to recess to recess until 9:00 tomorrow. And at that time, we'll continue with any senators that haven't had a chance to ask the first round of questions. If they're not here, we'll start with the second round.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2001-01-18", "title": "Secretary of the Interior Nominee Gale Norton's Senate Confirmation Hearing"}

Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.), Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Attorney General-designate John Ashcroft.]\nLEAHY: As those who have spent time in the Senate know, it's the luck of the draw where you end up for hearings. Today we're in the historic Senate Caucus room, the site of so many important Senate hearings, hearings into the sinking of the Titanic were held here. As you look around this room, you'll probably never see another public room anywhere in the country made like this. The McCarthy hearings, a number of hearings of the Supreme Court nominations and others were held here.\nYesterday we began the hearings with opening statements from nine Republican senators and seven Democratic senators. We heard from both senators from Missouri, who introduced Senator Ashcroft, and an additional Republican senator who testified in support of his nomination.\nWe heard the nominee's opening statement and his responses to the beginning round of questions. Today when we resume, we will begin with Senator Kohl and then go to the distinguished senator from Iowa. We'll try to conclude these opening rounds of questions for the nominee by sometime this evening. Now, I know that a number of senators have a number of questions and concerns. I want to give the nominee opportunity to respond to each of these, and we're willing to stay as late tonight as necessary, but it's going to take some cooperation.\nI'd like to conclude the official witnesses today, if we can. There's a lot of shifting demands going on, some from the other side. But I also want to make sure--there was a suggestion yesterday by the nominee that sometimes questions come very rapidly. As I said during the hearing yesterday, if he feels he did not have a chance to fully answer a question, he can answer that to us, and, of course, the senator asking the question can do a follow-up. He also has, as any nominee does, an opportunity to correct any answer, if he chooses to do so.\nFor example, yesterday Senator Ashcroft testified that the state of Missouri was not a party to the school desegregation litigation in St. Louis, and the state had done nothing wrong and there was no showing of a state violation. However, the state was a party defendant in that litigation since at least 1977, and the courts repeatedly held that the state was legally liable. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals noted in 1981: The state of Missouri vigorously contends that it should have no part in paying for the costs of integration because its actions did not violation the Constitution. This contention is wholly without merit.\nWe specifically recognize the causal relationship between the actions of the state of Missouri and the segregation existing in the St. Louis school system.\nThe next year, on another appeal in that case, the Eighth Circuit wrote that the state had substantially contributed to the segregation of public schools in St. Louis.\nAnd in yet another opinion, in another appeal in that case, the Eighth Circuit termed the state a primary constitutional violator and noted that the state's constitution and statutes mandated discrimination against black St. Louis students on the broadest possible basis.\nNow, that is my understanding, and I would ask, is there any disagreement with that understanding?\nASHCROFT: Well, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the situation, which involved the discussion of both the case in St. Louis and some of the case in Kansas City, which outlined and sort of defined the state's involvement some orders regarding the funding of desegregation plans in both of those communities.\nAnd when the state was initially ordered to do things, I argued on behalf of the state that it could not be found legally liable for its segregation in St. Louis because the state had not been made a party to the litigation.\nSubsequent to that time, the state was drawn into the litigation, and, obviously, by the time we had the case of Missouri v. Jenkins, which was what happened eventually in the Kansas City situation, the state was fully a party and, obviously, one of the named parties in the Supreme Court lawsuit.\nAnd I thank the chairman for making it possible to clarify that there was a time at which the state became a party, but that the state was originally...\nLEAHY: You were attorney general at that time, is that correct?\nASHCROFT: I believe that's correct.\nHATCH: I wonder if we could go to the regular order, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: I just wanted to--well, the answer...\nHATCH: That's the answer he gave yesterday, as well.\nLEAHY: Yes, but I think, as he pointed out, it needed a correction, and I'm trying to be fair to the nominee, because the answer was not...\nHATCH: I don't think it needed a correction. I mean, it was the answer he gave yesterday, and I think it was as plain as the nose on any of our faces.\nLEAHY: I...\nHATCH: Well, let's just have regular order.\nLEAHY: Well, we--the nominee just said he thanks me for the chance to correct it.\nBut go ahead, Senator Kohl.\nASHCROFT: Sir, in all due respect, I thank you for the opportunity to clarify.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Kohl?\nKOHL: Thank you, Senator Leahy.\nSenator Ashcroft, I believe that we failed the Senate and our constituents when we put politics above policy and bitterness above compromise. In an equally divided Senate, we have a terrific opportunity to give the public faith in democratic institutions. It's not clear whether or not you fully agree.\nYesterday, Senator Leahy read a 1998 quotation of yours.\nQuote: \"There are voices in the Republican Party today who preach pragmatism, who champion conciliation, and who counsel compromise. I stand here today to reject those deceptions. If ever there was a time to unfurl the banner of unabashed conservatism, it is now,\" unquote.\nAnd that year you were also quoted as saying, quote, \"There are two things you find in the middle of the road--a moderate and a dead skunk, and I don't want to be either one of those.\"\n(LAUGHTER)\nAs someone who works the middle of road, myself, I find these statements troubling. Tell us why we should believe that as attorney general, you will accept those voices in your own party who counsel compromise.\nASHCROFT: Well, I thank the senator for that question. I'm still getting adjusted to this, to hearing myself. It's like talking in the shower in this room. It's a little bit different, but I thank you.\nThe first quotation was a quotation about whether, in my judgment, a party should set forth a clear agenda. And I think it's important for the party to be in a position to debate. And I would expect the Republican party to be stating a clear, conservative position. And I generally expect people on the other side to state a more predominantly liberal position.\nAnd the process in the collision of those ideas is what I appreciated as the process in which we were able to work together in many instances to get legislation.\nWhen different ideas come from different quarters, those differences enhance the ultimate quality of what we do, and--pardon me for lapsing back into my \"we do.\" I'm no longer a member of the Senate, and I understand that. But at the time, I was a member of the Senate.\nAnd I think that when there are people who state a strong position on one side and a strong position on the other representing their parties, and then they come together in the process to reach a conclusion, it's valuable.\nAnother way of putting it would be that if we were all right there in the middle together, we wouldn't need the legislative process. The legislative process is the process of disagreement. It's the process of debate. It's the process of stating these and examining the various positions from one end to the other and then harmonizing those differences by working together.\nSo I expect the Republican Party, generally, to state a pretty strong conservative view, and to start the negotiations from that view with the understanding that, by the time you finish, we're going to have something that's going to be an enactment that results in something that the people can generally support and that will have good values expressed from a variety of significant perspectives.\nI'll have to say this, that I mean no injury or disrespect to those individuals who don't have my views in that respect. I just wanted to encourage people to not to think they always had to think what other people thought. They were free to have a position at one end of the spectrum or another. And that in the collision of those views, we hope that out of that collision the truth emerges and good policy and legislation emerges.\nThe joke about what you find in the middle of the road, I really regret it, if anyone is offended by it. I had one of the individuals who intends to testify against me tomorrow come up to me this morning and say, \"You know, I agree with you about the middle of the road. I'm on the other side of the road, and I tell the same story.\" Now, I don't know whether she will want to confess that when she is testifying tomorrow. But she said, \"I understand the joke. I'm from Texas and we didn't say dead skunk, we said armadillo.\"\nFrankly, I would be the first to say that I do not intend to impugn people for their political positions. And I'm sorry if that is to be taken in that respect. It was meant as a humorous sort of aside to say that I generally have been characterized fairly as a common-sense conservative and I haven't been right in the middle of the road.\nKOHL: Well, you're likely to be confirmed, as we all know, as the next attorney general of the United States. How will you be, or will you be, a different kind of an advocate as attorney general than you have been as a senator, in the sense that we in the Senate have seen you consistently very much on the right on virtually every issue? And that's fine. I mean, you know, you campaigned as that kind of a senator-to-be. You were elected and you've been that kind of a senator, and a very respectable senator, obviously. Is there a different kind of a person within your obviously strong philosophical background and views--but is there a different kind of a person who we might well expect to see as the attorney general of the United States?\nASHCROFT: Well, I thank you for that question, because these are vastly different roles. I mean, if a person is playing in the power-forward position he has one approach to the basket. If he is playing as the distributor of the ball, as the play-maker, he has another approach.\nWhen I was in leadership responsibilities with the National Association of Attorneys General, I understood that it wasn't my position to be in--I had to sacrifice some of my advocacy roles and some of what otherwise would have been my approach, to be responsible in those positions.\nSimilarly, when I was chairman of the National Governors Conference, or when I was elected to be the chairman of the Education Commission of the States, which was an education organization that involved, not only all the governors, but members of all the state legislatures and all the state school organizations that dealt with education.\nAnd there's another important difference with the attorney general, in that, as it relates to policy matters, he is referenced to the president of the United States. And it would be my responsibility to carry forward on things that this president of the United States would expect me to advance.\nNow, that's not inconsistent with what an attorney does, because an attorney represents individuals all the time. That's part of what we are trained to do. But I would say to you that I would expect, in the role of attorney general, to enforce all the laws vigorously; and as it related to policy matters, to reflect the administration's policy and effort to achieve the kinds of things that this administration was elected to achieve, by the American people.\nSo I understand the distinction. I think my past indicates that I've been capable on a number of occasions in making the difference in adjusting the way that I approach things to fit my responsibilities in the role that I'm expected to play.\nAnd I can pledge to you that I will work--to work with all people at the attorney general's office, and I will welcome the participation and conversation and involvement of all kinds of individuals.\nIn that respect, it may not be totally different from what I've done here in the United States Senate, because I've had the privilege of cosponsoring legislation with a lot of individuals, the chairman, in particular. And, obviously, we're not, what you would call inseparable twins on policy, but there are areas in respecting privacy...\nLEAHY: Separated at birth.\nASHCROFT: Separated at birth? Yes, OK.\nThat have made it possible for us to work together. And I would expect to work with a broad range of individuals, especially be honored to do so with members of this committee.\nKOHL: OK, thank you.\nIn 1979, as attorney general of Missouri, you brought an antitrust case against the National Organization of Women for sponsoring a boycott of states that had not yet ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. You lost the case all the way up to the Supreme Court.\nIt is a basic principle of antitrust law that when boycotts involve noncommercial concerns, the Sherman Act does not apply.\nAnd yet even if you lost the case, you still disputed the ruling. In 1981, you wrote a Law Review article that said, quote, \"The decision created a potentially disastrous exemption from the antitrust laws,\" and that \"parts of the decision severely strained antitrust laws.\"\nYou seem to have pursued a highly unusual use of the antitrust laws. Some have argued that you chose to further your political views above the Equal Rights Amendment by using your office as state attorney general. Furthermore, you kept appealing the case despite well-established Supreme Court precedent against you.\nCan you explain to us why you chose to pursue that case so vigorously?\nASHCROFT: I thank you for the question, and it's a valid one.\nIn response to the fact that the elected representatives in the legislature of Missouri chose not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, a boycott was organized of the state of Missouri which would have curtailed the state's ability to attract conventions and provide employment to individuals who populate the convention industry.\nThis lawsuit took place over 20 years ago, and I'm not sure I can recall all of the details. We filed the lawsuit, to the best of my recollection, because the boycott was hurting the people of Missouri, and we believed it to be in violation of the antitrust laws. The lawsuit had nothing to do with the ERA--we didn't sue the ERA--or with the political differences that I might have had with NOW. It simply was with the practice of saying that we're not going to--we're going to curtail convention business, and for individuals in my state who relied on that industry, they were to be hurt.\nNow, I litigated that matter thoroughly, and frankly, other states attempted it. One other state attempted a similar lawsuit, and not too long thereafter, I think a similar lawsuit was launched by an organization that questioned whether or not commercially directed boycotts were susceptible for achieving political ends.\nI think the law is well-settled and clear. After our case was resolved, and in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals one of the judges found in our favor and two of the judges found against us, so that it was a matter which had some acceptance in the courts. But obviously, I didn't carry the day.\nI think the law is clear now and has been clear in the aftermath of that decision. And from that perspective, I don't think it's an issue and can't be an issue. And there is and has been a well-established, subsequent set of circumstances that have demonstrated that commercial boycotts targeting individuals or industries to force third parties to vote or to conduct themselves in some way politically are acceptable.\nAnd since that's the case, that's the situation and the rule of law at this time. Having lost the case 2-1 in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court having denied cert, and other cases having been resolved, I accept that fully and have not recently alleged that there ought to be any change in the law in that respect.\nIt is a part of the way, I've come to believe, America resolves these issues.\nKOHL: Antitrust, Senator Ashcroft. Last week, American Airlines announced that it will buy TWA and enter a joint agreement to run D.C. Air and operate the Washington-New York shuttle. Meanwhile, the US Airways-United merger is under scrutiny at Justice. By mid-spring, we might see four airlines turn into two, and these two merged airlines will control a tremendous share of airline travel in the United States.\nThe combined US Airways-United and American-TWA share will be nearly one half of the domestic airline market. These two airlines will collectively dominate no fewer than 13 hubs, including many of our major, major airports.\nThis fast-moving consolidation in the airline industry doesn't leave the head of the Justice Department much time. Before we know it, we could have a domino effect in the airline industry take place. There's a real chance that transition and paralysis could result in a merger wave that won't stop until there are only three or four airlines nationwide.\nHow concerned should we be about this pending airline consolidation? When confirmed--if confirmed--how quickly do you intend to act? Is it something that's on your radar screen in a very major way? What can we expect from you by way of some action? Do you have something beyond the comment that it's a serious matter and you'll have to consider it? Can you tell us a direction in which you might very well go?\nASHCROFT: I consider it serious. I will study the issue very carefully. I do not know all of the facts and circumstances. I think it would inappropriate for me, not fully aware of this, to be announcing a position or a direction.\nI can tell you that I believe that competition is very important. And the absence of competition, I have witnessed, and it's a serious problem. In the absence of competition, I think you have very serious problems with rates. We've all seen what happens when there is only one way out of town. And we've watched how, in those settings, rates go way up. We've watched when Herb Kelleher comes to town with Southwest Airlines, and we've watched happens to rates in those situations. And my view is that it's very therapeutic when you get competition.\nI will do what I can to make sure that we maintain the right competition, but I'll have to base what I do on the responsibilities of the Justice Department. It has to be based on facts and a thorough investigation of the situation.\nKOHL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: The senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, I am told by Senator Hatch, is in another confirmation hearing, where he's questioning the witness, and so we will turn to the senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, I didn't realize how important this hearing was, until it was scheduled hear in the Senate Caucus Room. We haven't been here since Justice Thomas and Judge Bork. This is a very famous room for major matters. It's the room where President Kennedy announced for president back in 1960, so it's a commentary on the importance of the hearing.\nPermit me to go to a key issue on the choice issue, a woman's right to choose, and concerns which have been expressed about your enforcing the law, which I thought you stated very positively yesterday, and move to the area of prosecutorial discretion where there is substantial leeway for an attorney general, or even a district attorney, as I was for many years, dealing with the prosecutors' discretion on what cases to prosecute and how to handle them.\nAnd what I think many Americans are looking for, beyond your assurance that you will enforce the law, is your commitment to exercise your discretion to carry out the intent of the law on a woman's right to choose within the confines of existing law, which you have promised to support.\nOne of the votes that you cast that I thought was particularly significant was the one in the bankruptcy context; interesting that it should have an application to a woman's right to choose. But when protesters blocked abortion clinics, there have been some very substantial verdicts handed down, one in excess of $100 million.\nAnd when that issue came before the Senate, you voted that those individuals who had those verdicts against them would not be permitted to have a discharge in bankruptcy.\nWhat assurances can you give, Senator Ashcroft, that your discretionary calls as attorney general will be to enforce the intent behind existing law on a woman's right to choose?\nASHCROFT: Well, any constitutionally protected right is an important right. And I think people who interfere with the exercise of constitutionally protected rights should be the focus of attention by prosecutorial authorities.\nIt's my understanding that there are anticipated several dozen cases a year in terms of the violence or obstruction or coercion around abortion facilities or other reproductive health facilities. And I would think that it should be the responsibility of the attorney general to be able to respond aggressively in every one of those situations.\nSPECTER: Well, if you say aggressively, that is a good assurance. Aggressive has a well-accepted meaning. I like aggressive prosecutors.\nLet me pinpoint the issue on constitutionality of the statute--the freedom of access to clinic entrances. There have been some 24 cases which have challenged the constitutionality of the act under the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause, and all 24 of these cases have been decided favorably to the constitutionality of the act. The job of the attorney general, just like the job of the district attorney or state attorney general, is to uphold the constitutionality of the act, and I note you're nodding in the affirmative. Would you commit to the attorney general's generalized responsibility to support the constitutionality of existing legislation, like the freedom of access to clinic entrances?\nASHCROFT: Let me just say that I would support the constitutionality of the act. I don't believe there is a First Amendment right to coercion and intimidation. I think that's the clearest thing I can say. When people say that this act interferes with their First Amendment right, I don't think that's what the First Amendment provides.\nThe First Amendment does not mean that you have the right to intimidate a person who is exercising their constitutional rights. The First Amendment doesn't provide you with the right to violate the person, and safety and security of an individual in that respect. So I will vigorously enforce and defend the constitutionality of--of course, that's my responsibility.\nWhen this Senate acts and makes a determination through enactment signed by the president that something should be the law, that places a very high level of responsibility on the attorney general to carry that out.\nSPECTER: Let me move to freedom of religion, Senator Ashcroft, an area, again, where substantial concern has been expressed. There have been many quotations of your speech at Bob Jones University on, \"We have no king but Jesus.\" And I view that as a personal comment which you have made. We all have our own views on religion. And the question is not what John Ashcroft or Arlen Specter hold as religious views, but whether the sacrosanct provisions of the First Amendment on freedom of religion will be maintained or enforced, and the attorney general has a very vital role there.\nPolitical speeches frequently contain a lot of references to religion. This happens on both sides of the political aisle, and some of us may not do it and some of us may. But political speeches are one thing and personal views are another, but the most important factor is the enforcement of the law.\nNow, I note that, as attorney general of Missouri, you had acted to prohibit the distribution of religious materials on a campus. And what I would like to know is your determination, putting aside your own views, your resoluteness to enforce the sacrosanct provisions for freedom of religion of the First Amendment, and perhaps if there are other instances that you could show, in addition to that one where you stop the distribution of religious material on a campus.\nASHCROFT: Well, first of all, I am committed to the right of individuals to worship freely in accordance with the dictates of their own conscience or not to worship at all. And I will work assiduously to defend that right for all Americans.\nThe phrase, \"We have no king but Jesus,\" was a representation of what colonists were saying at the time of the American Revolution in a number of instances. And it became a bit of a rallying cry when people came to collect taxes on behalf of the king of England, and the American colonists would respond with that phrase.\nI was putting in that speech in context the idea that the ultimate authority of the ultimate idea of freedom in America is not governmentally derived. It basically went to something that was reflected when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. He didn't write: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men get from government equality...\nSPECTER: Senator Ashcroft, because of limited time...\nASHCROFT: Sure.\nSPECTER: ... would you pinpoint what you did specifically as attorney general of Missouri in not permitting religious matters to be handed out on campus?\nASHCROFT: Well, the question was raised about whether Christian groups could distribute Bibles on school grounds. And the Missouri Constitution happens to be even more adamant about church and state, and requiring separation far more clearly, even than does the U.S. Constitution. And I looked at the Constitution and these groups, obviously, were groups that I had some favor for, but, obviously, the law has to be followed.\nI simply...\nSPECTER: Did you stop the distribution of those...\nASHCROFT: I issued the opinion that indicated that distribution was unlawful.\nSPECTER: And what did you do?\nASHCROFT: Well, distribution ceased based on that.\nSPECTER: Let me move to Supreme Court nominations. Senator Ashcroft, President-elect Bush has already said that he would not employ a litmus test on pro-choice, pro-life on Supreme Court nominees. On this panel, many of us who are pro-choice have supported candidates for the Supreme Court who were known to be pro-life, and many senators who vote pro-life have supported nominees who have been known to be pro-choice.\nTo the extent that you have any rule in the selection of Supreme Court nominees, would you make a commitment not to employ a litmus test on the pro-choice, pro-life distinction?\nASHCROFT: I have not had a substantial discussion with the president-elect of the United States about my role in terms of judicial selection. I know the Constitution allocates clearly the appointment authority to the president. I know that he has indicated that he would not have a litmus test, and I believe that in my service to him, it would be important that I reflect that clear indication of his, that no litmus test would exist.\nSPECTER: So you would make a personal commitment not to apply a litmus test to Supreme Court selections to the extent that you may be involved in that?\nASHCROFT: To the extent that I have the authority, I'm going to do--I'm going to work with the president and his framework for developing Supreme Court justices. The answer is clear: No litmus test. I think he stated that clearly and that would be my position.\nSPECTER: Your position as well. OK.\nThe issue on antitrust has been broached by Senator Kohl, and I would like to pursue that a little further. I share Senator Kohl's concerns about the airline mergers. I'm concerned about what OPEC is doing. Just this morning these was an announcement of raised prices by OPEC curtailing production.\nI would like to make available to you a letter signed by six members of this committee to the president in April of last year setting forth a basis for litigating with OPEC antitrust violations.\nASHCROFT: I simply...\nSPECTER: Did you stop the distribution of those...\nASHCROFT: I issued the opinion that indicated that distribution was unlawful.\nSPECTER: And what did you do?\nASHCROFT: Well, distribution ceased based on that.\nSPECTER: Let me move to Supreme Court nominations. Senator Ashcroft, President-elect Bush has already said that he would not employ a litmus test on pro-choice, pro-life on Supreme Court nominees. On this panel, many of us who are pro-choice have supported candidates for the Supreme Court who were known to be pro-life, and many senators who vote pro-life have supported nominees who have been known to be pro-choice.\nTo the extent that you have any rule in the selection of Supreme Court nominees, would you make a commitment not to employ a litmus test on the pro-choice, pro-life distinction?\nASHCROFT: I have not had a substantial discussion with the president-elect of the United States about my role in terms of judicial selection. I know the Constitution allocates clearly the appointment authority to the president. I know that he has indicated that he would not have a litmus test, and I believe that in my service to him, it would be important that I reflect that clear indication of his, that no litmus test would exist.\nSPECTER: So you would make a personal commitment not to apply a litmus test to Supreme Court selections to the extent that you may be involved in that?\nASHCROFT: To the extent that I have the authority, I'm going to do--I'm going to work with the president and his framework for developing Supreme Court justices. The answer is clear: No litmus test. I think he stated that clearly and that would be my position.\nSPECTER: Your position as well. OK.\nThe issue on antitrust has been broached by Senator Kohl, and I would like to pursue that a little further. I share Senator Kohl's concerns about the airline mergers. I'm concerned about what OPEC is doing. Just this morning these was an announcement of raised prices by OPEC curtailing production.\nI would like to make available to you a letter signed by six members of this committee to the president in April of last year setting forth a basis for litigating with OPEC antitrust violations. And I ask you to take a look at that and give us a view of it a little later.\nStaying with the antitrust issue another moment or two, without expressing any view on the Microsoft case, because it is a very complex issue--it has been decided in the District Court. It is on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The question which I would like your response to is to what extent you would honor the court process. It would be one thing if the matter was considered ab initio by Attorney General Ashcroft, if confirmed, contrasted with an action which is already under way.\nHere you have a district court judgment, and you have the matter on appeal. To what extent--and here again I emphasize, I'm not commenting on the merits; that's something different. I'm only on the process as to the extent of recognition that, as attorney general, if confirmed, you would give to the existing legal status of the case.\nASHCROFT: Well, I'm very pleased to answer the question. The Microsoft case is a very important case. And the maintenance of competition in our culture is a very important aspect of what we need to make sure that we get the right output.\nI would first say that I'll have to confer with the people in the antitrust division. I don't know the facts of the Microsoft case. It is a very complex case, from what I've heard about the case. It relates to tying arrangements and the integration of various aspects of software. The judgment of the district court, obviously, would have substantial consequences.\nI would look very carefully at this case, relying on the expertise of the department, in deciding strategy for the case. And I'm not in the position to assure you that I would do anything other than that at this time.\nSPECTER: My yellow light is on, so I have less than a minute.\nI would conclude this round, Senator Ashcroft, by noting your sensing of humor, noting your membership among Singing Senators. In a senatorial role on official responsibilities, there is very little opportunity for a senator to display any sense of humor when you're talking about the death penalty or your talking about the weighty legal issues that come before the Congress of the United States, but I think it's something that ought to be noted.\nI have some concern, only slight, not about the fact that you don't drink or smoke, but that you don't dance...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... and some sense of wonderment as to how that fit in with your being so extraordinarily capable as a Singing Senator.\nAnd I would come back only for a moment to the middle-of-the-road question, and there are a lot of moderates who have asked me--I talk to some from time to time--about...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... the only people in the middle of the roads being dead skunks and moderates. And I've seen your sense of humor in the hearing room, which I think is exemplary. And I've noticed it a lot when you were on this side of the bench where you might have felt a little more comfortable, and sometimes your quips may get you into a little trouble.\nI think you've already explained it, but I have some explaining on that particular one with some of the people in the so-called moderate group.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Specter.\nI would not for the record the current chairman of this committee does dance, but that's probably disputed by my wife of 38 years.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI turn to the distinguished senior senator from California, Senator Feinstein.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, I must tell you, I am deeply puzzled by what I heard yesterday and what I hear today. I'm one that believes that, in political life, of which you've been part for 25 years, it's very hard to change your stripes or change your spots.\nAnd I see a kind of metamorphosis going on, a mutation, if you will, that somebody who has been really on the far right of many of the issues about which senators have spoken today or yesterday--civil rights, a woman's right to choice, certainly guns--is now making a change. And, quite frankly, I don't know what to believe.\nI'd like to confine my questions to choice and to guns.\nYou have a long history of vigorously criticizing the pro-choice position.\nIn 1998 you wrote, \"If I had the opportunity to pass but a single law, I would ban every abortion except those medically necessary to save the life of the mother.\"\nIn 1983, while you were attorney general, you told the Missouri Citizens For Life annual convention that you would not stop until and amendment outlawing abortion is added to the United States Constitution.\nWhen you spoke at the National Right to Life committee's annual convention, you said, and I quote, \"The Roe decision is simply a miserable failure, and I hope that the Supreme Court announces it is overturning the Roe decision and giving back to the states the right to make public policy.\" While governor in 1989, you declared the 16th anniversary of Roe v. Wade a day immemorial for aborted fetuses.\nSo you have in fact been an implacable foe of a woman's right to choose for a quarter of a century. You have supported legislation and even a constitutional amendment that would define life at the beginning of fertilization, which would not only criminalize all abortions and take away a woman's right to reproductive freedom and choice, but would also outlaw and criminalize many forms of the most common birth control options.\nI frankly don't know what to believe. You said of Bill Lann Lee, one of the reasons you voted against him was because he had the kind of intensity, and I quote, \"that belongs to advocacy, but not with the kind of balance that belongs to administration.\" And I might respectfully say the same thing about you and your record.\nI want to ask you some specific questions.\nWe talked in my office about a rape exception, and let me ask this question: Each year more than 32,000 women become pregnant as a result of rape, and approximately 50 percent of these end in abortion. Given the circumstances surrounding any rape, and certainly a resulting pregnancy, can you tell us why you feel there is no need for a rape exception to a ban on abortion?\nASHCROFT: Thank you for your question. I understand these are deeply held views of yours, and my opposition to the aborting of unborn children has been a deeply held position of mine. I have sought in a number of ways through the years to reduce and to curtail the abortion of unborn children, and I understand that reasonable people do differ on these things. And that's been not only my understanding, but it has been a bases for my seeking to act in concert with people to cooperate to move toward a variety of different ways to reduce the level of aborting unborn children in our culture and in our society.\nI have voted on numerous occasions for rape and incest exceptions and have voted for much broader exceptions than that. One time when I was governor I proposed that we only ban second abortions or abortions for second or third times. We banned abortions for racially mixed children, because people were wanting to abort a child for being racially mixed, or we banned abortions for sex selection.\nSo I think it's fair to say that, over the course of my time in office and with the prerogatives I've had as a public servant, I have adopted a variety of positions to try and reduce the number of children being aborted.\nI think it is also fair to say that I know the difference between an enactment role and an enforcement role. During my time as a public official, I have followed the law, and my following of the law has been clear.\nWhen I was the attorney general of the state and pro-life groups wanted to insist on the publication of abortion statistics for particular hospitals and they asked that those abortion statistics be published, I went to the law, and a fair reading of the law didn't allow for the publication of those statistics which could have made those hospitals the target for pro-life forces. I followed the law in saying that I would not force the state or rule that the state had to publish those statistics when I think the law was clear that it shouldn't.\nSo I have a record of being able to say, I know the difference between enacting the law, the debate about the law. My involvement in legislation has, very frankly, in recognition of the law, centered, in real terms, on trying to do things like get parental consent and other things like that. Those are the kinds of things which I have focused on--the ban on partial birth abortion.\nBut I will enforce the law fairly and aggressively, firmly. I know the difference between the debate over enacting the law and the responsibility of enforcing the law, and that's been clear in my record as a public servant.\nFEINSTEIN: Will you maintain the Department of Justice's task force on violence against health care providers and give it the resources it needs to continue?\nASHCROFT: There have been, I think, three different task forces in this respect. I will maintain such task forces and provide them with the kind of resources that they need in order to make sure that we don't impair the constitutional right of women to access reproductive health services.\nFEINSTEIN: Will you, 100 percent, investigate and prosecute activities that block the entrances to facilities where abortions are performed, even if the conduct is nonviolent?\nASHCROFT: If the conduct of anyone violates the law regarding the access of women to reproductive health services, I will enforce the law vigorously, I will investigate the alleged violations thoroughly, I will direct U.S. attorneys to devote resources to that on a priority basis.\nFEINSTEIN: When you said yesterday that Roe was a settled question, does that indicate that you accept this adjudication and that you will use all of the elements of your office to support it?\nASHCROFT: I believe that both Roe and Casey and, I guess--is it Stenberg; is that the most recent case that related to the Nebraska statute?--are settled law.\nIn the application for certiorari, I think on the Stenberg case, there was a request by one of the parties that Roe be reconsidered. The Supreme Court has signaled very clearly it doesn't want to deal with that issue again.\nI would say that I do not want to devalue the currency of the solicitor general of the United States by taking matters to the Supreme Court on a basis which the Supreme Court has already signaled: We don't want to deal with and were unwilling to deal with.\nI think, you know, the solicitor general of the United States has some standing and prestige in the United States Supreme Court, and to consistently go back to the court insisting that the court do what the court has indicated that it doesn't want to do devalues the ability of the solicitor general in other matters. It not only is thus a losing proposition, but it is counterproductive as it relates to the ability to succeed on other issues in the Justice Department. And therefore, accepting Roe and Casey as settled law is important, not just to this arena, but important in terms of the credibility of the department.\nFEINSTEIN: Let me change to guns for a moment. In this body, I was the main author of the assault weapons legislation in 1993. I feel very strongly and very passionately that assault weapons have no role in this society on the streets of our communities.\nThat law is supported by virtually every federal and local and state law enforcement agency across our land, and I think law enforcement recognizes that there is no legitimate reason for civilians to have military-style weapons that are useless for hunting or, really, for self-defense.\nNow, the National Rifle Association, on the other hand, opposed and continues to oppose the federal assault weapons ban in court in suits in which the Justice Department took the other side defending the statute. You called this ban wrong-headed in a response letter to Sarah Brady in 1998. If you become attorney general, will you maintain the Justice Department position in support of the assault weapons ban?\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nFEINSTEIN: Will you support its reauthorization when it sunsets in 2004?\nASHCROFT: It is my understanding that the president-elect of the United States has indicated his clear support for extending the assault weapon ban, and I would be pleased to move forward with that position and to support that as a policy of this president and as a policy of the Justice Department.\nI might add that I had the--I don't believe the Second Amendment to be one that forbids any regulation of guns. In some of the hearings that I conducted when I had the privilege of serving on this committee and was the chairman of this Constitution Subcommittee, we discussed those issues.\nAnd, for instance, in the Juvenile Justice bill, I sought to amend the Juvenile Justice bill so as to make semi-automatic assault weapons illegal for children, just as handguns are illegal for children.\nAnd there are a number of enactments which I would not prefer as policy, but which I believe would be constitutional. As a policy-maker, I may not think that a particular weapons ban would be appropriate, but as--whether--I could have voted against a number of things which I thought constitutional but which I might have thought bad judgment.\nWhat I'm trying to clarify here is that I believe that there are constitutional inhibitions on the rights of citizens to bear certain kinds of arms. And some of those I would think good judgment, some of those I'd think bad judgment.\nBut as attorney general, it's not my judgment to make that kind of call my judgment. My responsibility is to uphold the acts of the legislative branch of this government in that arena, and I would do so and continue to do so in regard to the cases that now exist and further enactments of the Congress.\nFEINSTEIN: Now let me ask you another question on guns. I was a cosponsor of the Juvenile Justice bill, with Senator Hatch as the main author. We wrote the gang abatement section of the bill because I am deeply troubled by gangs that have moved across state lines. Some of the gangs that have originated in California are now all over the United States.\nAnd in that bill, we use the RICO laws to set some predicates. And some of the crimes I was interested in adding were trafficking in guns with obliterated serial numbers; possession of machine guns; knowingly transferring a smuggled gun to be used in a drug or violent crime; importing guns with intent to commit a drug or violent crime; stealing guns; transportation of bombs, machine guns or sawed-off shotguns by an unlicensed person; transporting stolen guns; possession of illegal assault weapons; and stealing firearms from a licensed dealer, importer, manufacturer or collector.\nThe point of adding these crimes as RICO predicates was to give law enforcement the ability to seize the assets of violent gangs and increase penalties for gangs conspiring to commit these and other crimes.\nNow, it is my understanding that you worked to strip the bill of these predicates. My question is why.\nASHCROFT: Well, first of all, let me say that in the event the bill passes with those predicates, I will defend the bill and instruct the department to defend the bill and its constitutionality.\nThere were a number of individuals that expressed to me serious reservations about the RICO applications in the bill. RICO has been a controversial matter that has been questioned by members of this committee on both sides in terms of potential abuses, even gaining the attention of ACLU, which has challenged the application of RICO in these settings.\nThose were the reasons that I had challenged the wisdom of including those in the bill and the effect of its inclusion on the ultimate passage of the bill.\nAs attorney general, I would provide instruction to the solicitor general, and others in the department, in the defense of actions to support the bill. It's clearly within the range of items that would be the responsibility of the attorney general to support.\nFEINSTEIN: I believe my time is up.\nThank you very much, Senator, I appreciate that.\nLEAHY: Senator Grassley, who is the ranking member and incoming chairman of the Finance Committee is still tied up at the secretary of the treasury hearings.\nWe will go to the distinguished senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\nIncidentally, I would note before Senator Kyl starts, when Senator Grassley is able to rejoin--we all understand he has to be gone. When he does, I've discussed with Senator Hatch, he would then become the next Republican to ask questions.\nKYL: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman, I'd like to cover three things, if I could, in this round of questioning. First of all, I'd like to make a comment about some statements that Senator Kennedy made, and if Senator Ashcroft wishes to respond, to afford him the opportunity. Secondly, to ask a question about nomination standard. And third, if there is time, to get into the issue of victims' rights.\nFirst of all, Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy in his opening statement launched a litany of attacks against Senator Ashcroft, some of which Senator Ashcroft had an opportunity to address. In my opinion, most of these attacks had the effect of distorting Senator Ashcroft's record, and I think that they were unfair.\nFirst of all, Senator Kennedy said that Senator Ashcroft--and I'm quoting now, these are direct quotations from the transcript--\"strongly opposed school desegregation.\" Now, that's not true from what I understand. And Senator Ashcroft did have the opportunity briefly to testify that he strongly supports desegregation, believes in integration and protecting everyone's civil rights.\nSecondly, Senator Kennedy said that Senator Ashcroft, and again I'm quoting, \"strongly opposed voter registration in St. Louis.\"\nNow, apart from being obviously incorrect on its face, Senator Ashcroft also had some opportunity to explain that he does not oppose voter registration in St. Louis. In fact, the etiology of that charge was legislation that he vetoed having to do with voter registration policies in the state, one of the bills being strongly recommended for veto by predominately Democratic public officials.\nThird, Senator Kennedy charged that Senator Ashcroft did not support our laws concerning access to contraception and a woman's right to choose. Here I simply note that while I don't think that Senator Kennedy was inaccurate in the way he described Senator Ashcroft's positions necessarily, there is an implication that's left that is inaccurate.\nWhile it is true that Senator Ashcroft, as a legislator, sought to change some of the law, he said then and has had further opportunity and amplify, in response to Senator Feinstein's question, that in his very different role, as the lawyer for the American people, that he would fully enforce the law as it exists.\nFourth, Senator Kennedy said that Senator Ashcroft, and again I'm quoting, \"is so far out of the mainstream that he has said that citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against a tyrannical government,\" end of quotation. Now, the way that that charge was made, made it sound very irresponsible for anyone to take such a position and it made it sound like this was something that Senator Ashcroft was very concerned about and, therefore, very much distorted his views.\nThe charge was obviously out of context. The correct context--and this is something that Senator Ashcroft did not have an opportunity to respond to. If my characterization is inaccurate, I ask him to please to add to what I say. But the remarks that he's referring to, I believe, are those that occurred before a hearing of the Constitution Subcommittee of this committee, which Senator Ashcroft chaired, and during which he observed that the Second Amendment conferred individual rights upon citizens.\nAnd here is his quotation, the full quotation from that hearing--it was a resuscitation of the views of James Madison the father of our Constitution--and here's what Senator Ashcroft remarked: \"In Federalist 46, James Madison, who later drafted the Second Amendment, argued that the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possessed over the people of almost every other nation, would deter the new central government from tyranny,\" end of quotation.\nAs we know, James Madison was the primary author of much of the Constitution. And I frankly think it's a stretch to consider the founders and James Madison out of the mainstream, but don't take it from me.\nSenator Feingold, during his questioning, among other things, said this--and this is a quotation from the transcript: \"I listened carefully to every word you,\" meaning Senator Ashcroft, \"said. And I reserve the right to change my mind after the transcript, but I believe I agree with every single word you've just said.\" Continuing the quotation, \"The purposes of the Second Amendment includes self-defense, hunting, sport, and some certainly would say, as would I, the protection of individual rights against a potentially despotic central government. The Second Amendment was clearly intended to counterbalance a distrust of and to protect the right to defend against an oppressive government.\"\nMr. Chairman, while there is certainly room for us to debate Second Amendment and gun control issues--and we've had robust debates about that--I think it goes too far to characterize a position that was held by President Madison, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Feingold and a lot of other scholars on the issues, as outside the mainstream.\nAnd, in fact, I suggest it may say more about Senator Kennedy's locus in the spectrum of American public opinion.\nFifth, Senator Kennedy said that Senator Ashcroft, quote, \"opposes virtually all gun control laws.\" And he had some opportunity yesterday to explain his view that that is not true and to further expand in his answer to Senator Feinstein just a moment ago. He supports the Brady law; voted to require mandatory background checks for all gun purchases at gun shows; to prohibit firearms in a school zone; to prohibit those convicted of domestic violence from possessing a firearm; drafted the juvenile assault weapon ban that passed the Senate 92 to 2; and supports President-elect Bush's policies to aggressively prosecute those who buy guns illegally, sell them illegally or commit crimes with guns.\nAnd finally, Senator Kennedy said that Senator Ashcroft, and I'm quoting here again, quote, \"doesn't respect the right to free speech under the First Amendment.\"\nNow, Mr. Chairman, you can differ with Senator Ashcroft on some issues, but I think it's not responsible to charge that he doesn't respect the right to free speech under the First Amendment. I think he's made it very clear that he will enforce the law and that he's been an outspoken defender of the First Amendment for many years.\nSenator Ashcroft, I hope that I have correctly characterized your views. Have I done so and is there anything you would like to add?\nASHCROFT: Well, first of all, I'm grateful to you for having been so careful in your approach to these matters, and I appreciate the opportunity for the clarification.\nKENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I would hope that, after Mr. Kyl's time has been allocated, that I'd have a chance to respond, in terms of fairness.\nLEAHY: Under the normal practice, when there is such direct reference by one senator to another senator on the panel, the senator from Massachusetts will be given time to respond. That time will not come out of either Senator Kyl's or Senator Kennedy's time.\nKYL: Mr. Chairman, I would hope that we could establish a process here, however. It is not appropriate to throughout charges, and when there is a response to those charges by a senator rather than Senator Ashcroft that that would unbalance the time that each of us on the committee have to present our questions and our statements.\nLEAHY: We are trying to find our process and neither senator will lose on their time as a result of that.\nKYL: Senator Ashcroft, let me ask you. There were attempts yesterday to define, by senators here on the dais, an Ashcroft standard for confirmation of Cabinet nominees. Perhaps rather than defining that standard for you, it would be appropriate for you to define the Ashcroft standard.\nCould you tell the committee what you believe is the appropriate standard for the confirmation of Cabinet or sub-Cabinet nominees?\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator.\nI think it is one of the solemn responsibilities of members of the Senate to make judgments and to participate with the president of the United States in providing the staffing of the Cabinet-level positions and a variety of other positions.\nIn my six years in the United States Senate, approximately almost 1,700--I think it's 1,686--presidential nominees have come before the Senate, both judicial and nonjudicial, of course. Of that 1,686, I opposed 15 of them. Of President Clinton's 230 judicial nominees, I voted to confirm 218.\nIn fact, I never opposed a president's Cabinet nominee. Larry Summers, Alexis Herman, Bill Richardson--clearly, there were policy differences in that respect, but I never opposed the nominee. The president is entitled, in my judgment, to assemble a Cabinet that reflects his policy views.\nNotwithstanding these facts, Chairman Leahy suggested that my opposition to these nominees reflected an inappropriate standard of review. And the suggestion seems to be that any nominee with whom I differed failed to garner my support. I just want to make it clear that differing with a nominee did not mean they didn't get my support.\nConsider the case of Bill Richardson. In 1996, he was nominated by the president to be the United States ambassador to the United Nations. As Senator Biden and others will recall, he came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I sat. I had real policy concerns. We differed on important issues, such as international family planning, UN peacekeeping operations, and the U.S. funding of a rapidly expanding UN bureaucracy.\nWhen asked about administration plans to help retire the U.S. debt, Richardson asked the committee to keep an open mind, and I did.\nI supported his nomination despite a significant lobbying effort by some groups. Richardson was not an exception. He was part of a larger role--in Chairman Leahy's words, \"a standard.\" I examined the candidates' record in light of the position for which they were nominated, then I made an objective determination based on the facts.\nFor federal judicial nominations seeking lifetime tenure, I looked for individuals that understood the difference between interpreting the law and legislating from the bench. For the position of surgeon general, I looked for someone whose career reflected high ethical standards of the profession. Finally, in the case of William Lann Lee, I considered carefully whether the nominee would enforce the Supreme Court's most recent ruling on racial quotas.\nAlthough my review contemplated the nature of the job and the varied responsibilities, the standard consistently ensured that the candidates understood the requirements of the job. I simply wanted to ensure that a judicial candidate understood the judicial role, that law enforcement candidates understood the responsibility to enforce the law of the land, and this was not an overly demanding standard in my judgment. It led me to approve 1671 of the president's nominees and every one of his Cabinet nominees.\nKYL: So, Senator Ashcroft, would it be fair to say--and I do not mean to put words in your mouth--that simply differing on ideological grounds with a nominee was not, in your view, a reason to vote against a nominee?\nASHCROFT: I think it would be a real stretch for members of this committee to think that I agreed completely with 218 judicial nominees of the president which I voted for. I, obviously--I doubt if the Clinton administration would be doing the kind of job it wanted to do had that been the case.\nBut I believed that it was appropriate to have differences of opinion with those individuals and differences in philosophy and differences in understanding, and to recognize and respect them, and to vote for their confirmation.\nKYL: Thank you.\nI'd like to conclude with the matter of victim's rights, something that both Senator Feinstein and I have worked on very hard--and I must say, with your strong support, which I appreciate very, very much. And I know Senator Feinstein does as well.\nLet me go back. You actually worked to gain support of a Missouri constitutional amendment on crime victim rights, is that correct?\nASHCROFT: That's correct. Missouri has a very substantial victims' rights framework, which I think would be enhanced by a federal victims' rights amendment. And that's the reason I had worked to try and find a way to try to get that kind of thing in place federally.\nKYL: And just so members of the committee will know, I came to you. You chaired the Constitution Subcommittee. I had to talk to you about our amendment, and you were very willing to conduct a hearing so that we could get our amendment to the full committee and to the floor of the Senate for it to be considered. Again, I thank you very, very much for your cooperation in that regard.\nASHCROFT: Well, I hope I was very accommodating to you.\nKYL: Well, you were, but also you helped us to do that in a very timely fashion. I appreciate that.\nMy time is just about up. But perhaps you could just make a conclusory statement. There is a long list of things that you have done to assist us in the development of the constitutional amendment and to gain funding for victims' rights, to add to the law other protections for victims' rights, a whole litany of things that we could talk about here. But perhaps, just a short comment on your commitment to supporting victims' rights would be appropriate here.\nASHCROFT: Well, if the Justice Department is to be focused on justice for all Americans, there is a need for justice for those who have been offended, as well as those who are the offenders. And the victims' rights amendment and the victims' rights movement is designed to help us have balance in this respect.\nAs you well know, one of my clear efforts was to make sure that we have a recognition that people can be victimized even if they are not physically abused or assaulted, particularly older Americans who are victimized by fraud and other scam situations. They need to be protected in victims' rights legislation, and that was part of one of the things I sought to do.\nI commend both you and Senator Feinstein for your effort in this respect.\nLeaving the enactment arena was not a matter of my choice. And so, I will no longer have the ability to sort of advocate in a way for issues like that, that I did previously, but I commend you for your efforts.\nKYL: Thank you very much.\nKENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to have time to respond to the senator, without the time being charged to either side, please, since there was a direct assault, in terms of representations that I made.\nLEAHY: Following the normal procedure, you can.\nKENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, this is the condemnation of the messenger. My good friend from Arizona doesn't like the message, but the message is out there. And that is what the message is we have to have, what is before this committee. And let's just come back for a minute. I know that the senator has asked about state involvement in the desegregation cases, in the voluntary cases in St. Louis, and he has responded yesterday and he responded today, and he's wrong. Plain, simple wrong.\nNow, this is what the 1980 Adams case says. Senator Ashcroft says the state was not involved in that case. This is what the Adams v. U.S., 1980--the city and the state were jointly responsible for maintaining a segregated school system. In reaching this decision, we note that Missouri state Constitution had mandated separate schools for white and colored children through '76, and the state--of which he was attorney general--had not taken prompt and effective steps to desegregate the city schools in Brown.\n1982, the state again protests liability for this. We again note that he--the state and the city board, already adjudged violators of the Constitution, could be required to fund the measures, including measures involving a voluntary participation of the schools. The state was involved.\nThe fact is, Senator Ashcroft didn't listen to the judges, saying that the state was involved. That's the fact, Senator. And I don't retreat on that. I said it yesterday and I'll say it again today.\nAnd I would hope that he'd have a more complete answer, because it is clear, and any fair-minded person reading those cases will find that to be so.\nSecondly, I don't retreat in his opposition to failing to meet his responsibilities to register voters in St. Louis. He vetoed one bill, and the senator listed various Democratic officials saying, \"Well, we're glad we vetoed it because it was only targeted on St. Louis.\"\nThen, the next year, did Senator Ashcroft do anything to try and include registration? No. What happened? The legislature in the state said, if he's going to veto it because it just applies to St. Louis, we'll apply one that goes to the whole state. And what does Governor Ashcroft do then? Veto it again.\nAnd what's been the bottom line on it? The fact that tens of thousands of blacks were not able to participate in the voting. That happens to be relevant, Senator, because we've just gone through a national debate and discussion and focus on the question of whether minorities are going to be able to vote. And there are current investigations on that issue.\nThat might not be important to you, Senator, but I think it's important to the quality of the person that is going to be the head of the Justice Department. And I don't retreat one step on it.\nNow the Senator comes back to the question on guns. The questions on guns, fine. We talk about the questions, the list, on the questions on the guns.\nNow, Senator Ashcroft voted against closing the gun show loophole, said he would have voted to oppose the assault weapons ban. He'll have an opportunity to give this president, whether they want to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. I wish he had, in response to earlier question, to show how interested he is in enforcing it, say, \"And I'd be glad to recommend to the president, when it expires, when we're going to recommend that he extend that the next time.\" I would have given him an opportunity to say that.\nHe's voted twice against child safety locks. He's voted against the ban on the importation of high ammunition magazines, voted twice to weaken existing laws by removing background checks. And he led the campaign for concealable weapons that even child molesters who've been convicted in Missouri would be able to acquire, that was defeated by the people of Missouri. And you wonder why we bring up the issue?\nAnd, Senator, he used those words that I quoted yesterday. Senator Ashcroft used those words, besides calling James Brady, who was shot in the assassination attempt of President Reagan, a loyal Republican, distinguished citizen whose life has been battling those wounds, and you call him the leading enemy of responsible gun owners.\nAnd then you went on, and I said that Senator Ashcroft is so far out of the mainstream, he has said citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against the tyrannical government in our government. Our government tyrannical? If the senator from Arizona doesn't know the difference between the British insurrection at the American Revolution and this government that has been formed under James Madison and the Constitution--there is a significant one.\nNow listen to this. Listen to what he said is--indeed--and this is quote. This is Senator Ashcroft. \"Indeed, the Second Amendment, like the First, an important individual liberty that in turn promotes good government. A citizenry armed with the right both to possess firearms and to speak freely is less likely to fall victim to a tyrannical central government than a citizenry that is disarmed from criticizing government or defending themselves.\"\nListen just to what Gary Wills, a Pulitzer Prize winner, wrote about that. Gary Wills, a Pulitzer Prize winner, has written, \"Listen, only a madman, one would think, can suppose that militias have a constitutional right to levy war against the United States, which is treason by constitutional definition under this.\"\nI think this nominee owes an apology to the people of the United States for that insinuation, talking about our government now being the source of a tyrannical oppression. That's what I think, Senator. I don't retreat. I don't retreat on any one of those matters.\nI could take other time, but, Mr. Chairman, I will close at this time.\nKYL: Mr. Chairman, I'll be brief, if I could as a matter of personal privilege...\nKENNEDY: Well, then I'll reserve time too then...\nLEAHY: Following our procedure, the senator from Arizona has a chance to respond.\nKYL: Simply because Senator Kennedy made some comments directly to me about matters not being important to you, Senator--meaning to me--I respond that all of these matters are important. It is totally appropriate to raise the issues. What I objected to was what I considered to be the mischaracterization of Senator Ashcroft's positions. And every one of my references to Senator Kennedy were direct quotations taken from the transcript. Nothing was misquoted at all.\nWithout getting into each of the different substantive issues, which Senator Ashcroft ought to have the opportunity to do, I simply would note here that it is important for us to raise the issues, as Senator Kennedy and others have done, to have a calm and rational discussion of all of the import of those issues with respect to Senator Ashcroft's nomination, and to carefully examine how he will apply and follow the law as attorney general.\nBut I think as--primarily since most of us are lawyers here--it's very important for us to be careful about the language that we use. And therefore, Senator Kennedy, when you say, \"Well, that may be important to you, Senator,\" of course it's important to me. And when you talk about--you wonder why we bring up these issues, of course it's appropriate to bring up the issues.\nI'm concerned here about mischaracterization, and I would assert that when you just now suggest that Senator Ashcroft was asserting that the United States government is an tyrannical government, that that is not an accurate representation of his views under any reading of what he has said or listening to what he has said.\nSo, I'll conclude in that.\nKENNEDY: Well--15, 30 seconds--these issues are perhaps painful to be examined. Perhaps they are. But they should be. They should be. Each and every one of those issues ought to be examined, Senator.\nAnd I, with all respect, I reject--if you don't appreciate the way that I present it, I can accept that. But I want to make it very clear that I would restate those. And I would be glad--I won't take the chance at this time; I will on the floor of the United States Senate--to take as much time as necessary, and it may take some time to debate those particular issues.\nLEAHY: The chair is about to take a five-minute break, unless the nominee wishes to respond to any of the colloquies that have been going on between the distinguished senator from Massachusetts and the distinguished senator from Arizona.\nASHCROFT: I side with the chair.\nLEAHY: I thought you might.\nWe're taking a five-minute recess.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: Let us get back in.\nThe distinguished senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, is recognized for his round of questions.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, we worked together well and cooperatively on the Constitution Subcommittee of this committee, and I can't help but say, after the exchange earlier, that I'll miss working with you on that subcommittee. But I am relieved that you will not have a vote on those constitutional amendments anymore, because we had a very strong disagreement on that, but it was a very polite disagreement.\nI'd like to spend my time in this round talking primarily about judicial nominations and civil rights.\nAnd, first, on judicial nominations--I've said this to you before--I think the actions of the this committee with respect to the judicial nominations of President Clinton were inappropriate. I believe the committee acted inappropriately in allowing nominations to languish for months and years without even a hearing. It seemed, as I've said before, that some didn't even accept the results of the 1996 presidential election. I think a terrible wrong was done to qualified judges and lawyers, like Bonnie Campbell and Helene White and Kathleen McRee Lewis.\nSenator Ashcroft, one person whose nomination was never acted upon in the last Congress is Roger Gregory, a lawyer from Richmond, Virginia. President Clinton nominated Mr. Gregory for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I know that you're familiar with that because we did discuss it in our meeting.\nLast month, President Clinton appointed Mr. Gregory to fill that Fourth Circuit position during the congressional recess, and, under this recess appointment, Judge Gregory will serve until the end of this congressional session unless he is confirmed by the Senate, in which case, of course, he would be on the bench for life.\nHe has therefore become the first African-American to serve on the Fourth Circuit in history. And, Senator Ashcroft, recess appointments have been used in the past to integrate the federal bench. A. Leon Higginbotham and Spotswood Robinson, the first African-Americans to sit on the Third and D.C. circuits, respectively, were both recess appointments by President Johnson in 1964. And President Kennedy used the recess appointment power to make Thurgood Marshall the first African-American judge on the Second Circuit in 1961. All of these appointments were ultimately confirmed to full life terms.\nSenator Ashcroft, do you see a problem with the circumstances that, in the year 2001, there is not a single African-American who has ever been confirmed for a life-time appointment to the court of appeals for the Fourth Circuit?\nASHCROFT: Senator Feingold, I believe that we should try to get the best-qualified individuals available for judicial positions, and that we should try make sure that our judiciary reflects the kind of population that we have in the country. It's important to do.\nWhen I was governor of the state of Missouri, I took special care to try and make sure that we appointed individuals who hadn't previously had access to judicial positions. That's why I appointed the first two women to the Court of Appeals benches in Missouri--the first black to the Western District Court of Appeals, the first woman to the Supreme Court--and why I set a record in appointments during my time as governor for appointing African-Americans to the bench.\nI think it is important that we have individuals and I think there are high-quality individuals representing every quadrant of our culture, and I want to make my understanding and firm belief in that clear. And I would hope that we would have a capacity to see in virtually every aspect of our judicial system--in every aspect--scratch the word virtually--the kind of racial diversity which makes up America.\nSo I don't see any problem in--maybe I've forgotten the question--I would welcome--I would like to see greater diversity in settings like that.\nFEINGOLD: Given your record as you've described it, surely the fact that there has never been an African-American in the Fourth Circuit, which I understand is the largest percentage of any circuit in the country, would trouble you. So I would specifically ask you, to the extent you will be involved, will you support Roger Gregory's nomination and press for confirmation by the Senate so he can serve for life as do the other judges on the circuit? And, therefore, would you recommend that President Bush not withdraw the nomination?\nASHCROFT: When the president of the United States announced his designation of me as the next attorney general, he indicated to me he expected me to give him legal advice in private and to give it to him. I owe him that respect and that honor.\nI think I can say to you that the kind of advice I will give him is likely to be reflected in the kind of effort that I've made when I've had appointing authority. And if the president of the United States chooses to send that name forward for nomination, I will enthusiastically work to make sure that confirmation is achieved.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. I have high hopes for that one.\nAnd now I'd like to turn to the federal death penalty and the broader subject of the death penalty. President-elect Bush supports the use of capital punishment, as I understand you do. While a majority of Americans continue to support the death penalty, a majority of Americans are also increasingly alarmed by the lack of fairness and reliability in the administration of this ultimate punishment. The system is prone to errors.\nFor example, since the 1970s, our nation has sent--at last count--93 people to death row who are later found to be innocent.\nSenator, do you acknowledge that our justice system has made mistakes and that innocent people have been convicted and even sentenced to death?\nASHCROFT: I acknowledge that individuals have been sentenced to death and have been convicted whose convictions have been overturned, and their convictions and sentences were inappropriate when made.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you. And then, let me follow that by indicating, as you well know, on December 22, 2000, at the press conference announcing your nomination to be attorney general, you and President-elect Bush were asked a question about the federal death penalty system and whether a moratorium on executions is warranted at the federal level. And I was relatively pleased with President-elect Bush's measured response. He says he supports the death penalty when it's administered fairly, justly and surely.\nAnd in that regard, I would ask if you agree with President Clinton that the gravity and finality of the death penalty demand that we be certain that, when it is imposed, it is imposed fairly?\nASHCROFT: I think it is a very serious responsibility, and it should be only after a very reliable process of integrity has been undertaken. When I served as governor of the state of Missouri, I had a rather awesome responsibility, when the death penalty was reinstituted in my state, of being the last evaluator of the fairness and integrity of the system.\nHaving sat in that setting and having felt that responsibility, I take very seriously doing what we can to make sure that we have thorough integrity and validity in the judgments we reach.\nFEINGOLD: Well, in light of that answer, I will ask if you will support the effort of the National Institute of Justice that is already under way to undertake the study of racial and geographic disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty that President Clinton deemed necessary.\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you for that.\nWill you continue and support all efforts initiated by Attorney General Reno's Justice Department to undertake a thorough review and analysis of the federal death penalty system?\nASHCROFT: I thought that's what you were referring to in the first instance, but the studies that are under way, I'm grateful for them. When the material from those studies comes, I will examine them carefully and eagerly to see if there are ways for us to improve the administration of justice. I have absolutely no reason, in any respect, to think that we want to turn our backs on a capacity to elevate the integrity of our judicial system, especially in criminal matters, and most importantly in matters that are capital in nature.\nFEINGOLD: So those studies will not be terminated?\nASHCROFT: I have no intention of terminating those studies.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator.\nNow, let me turn to a third area that you and I have discussed on a number of occasions, the issues of racial profiling. At the hearing on this bill last year, I was very pleased to hear you say that you believe the practice of racial profiling is unconstitutional, and I believe you've repeated that several times this week. You also said that we need to find out how big the issue is and that this bill--the one that I sponsored with Senator Lautenberg--represented a good start. You said that with some suggested changes you could support the bill. And we had some discussions following that hearing in which we talked about your changes, and frankly we agreed to your changes, but in the end you never joined as a cosponsor of the bill. But here we are today.\nIf confirmed as attorney general, would you support this bill and encourage its passage in the House and Senate?\nASHCROFT: First of all, I want to commend you for your work in this respect. The hearing which you assembled was my hearing, I was the chairman, and you came to me and asked me if I wanted to address this serious issue and I said, \"Please, you move forward to do it. You know the territory.\" It was the first hearing, I believe, in the United States Senate on this practice. And not only were you there, but Senator Kennedy participated, Senator Torricelli was present.\nI stated at the hearing that I think racial profiling is wrong. I think it's unconstitutional. I think it violates the 14th Amendment. I think most of the men and women in our law enforcement are good people trying to enforce the law.\nI think we all share that view.\nBut we owe it to provide them with guidance to ensure that racial profiling does not happen. I look forward to working together with you to try to find a way to do that.\nThe president-elect of the United States--unless I heard him incorrectly in one of the debates that I was watching--said very clearly that he rejected the idea that people would be dealt with on the basis of their race. In my current position, I can't endorse any specific legislation, but I worked with you and you know that I felt good about what you were doing and that, frankly, I talked to you about specific items. I believe that I suggested some ways that the bill could be improved, clarifying that the study is compiled from materials voluntarily collected, which I understand is the intent of the bill.\nFEINGOLD: Absolutely.\nASHCROFT: Expanding the kind of data that the attorney general reviews and clarifying that nothing in the bill changes any burdens of proof for parties in litigation...\nFEINGOLD: In light of those points, which we certainly agreed to, would you support this legislation?\nASHCROFT: Those were the kinds that I personally thought were appropriate and would have made the bill, if in fact they finally got done. My recollection is not clear. I don't know how I can more clearly say to you that this is a matter that troubles me.\nThere was an indelible moment in the hearing, as a matter of fact. And it wasn't the sergeant that came; it was the videotape of his son. He had the sergeant who was taking his son across one of our states stopped twice. And I certainly agree with that.\nFEINGOLD: Let me just repeat though, because I think you're going as far as you can to say you'll support this bill; Senator Kennedy said at the hearing, this bill couldn't possibly be more modest. All it is about is collecting data. If there is any seriousness on your part or the part of the president-elect about racial profiling, this is a very easy bill to support. I again have high hopes.\nAs attorney general, what other steps would you take to eliminate racial profiling?\nASHCROFT: Well, as it relates to enforcement by the Department of Justice, I would do my best never to allow a person to suffer solely on the basis of a person's race. As you well know, there are responsibilities for enforcement that are intended to the Justice Department. While we have talked about responsibilities of state and local law enforcement officials, it is important that the federal government be leading when it comes to respecting the rights of individuals and the Constitution. I will do everything I can to make sure that we lead properly in that respect.\nFEINGOLD: Will you make racial profiling a priority of yours?\nASHCROFT: I will make racial profiling a priority of mine.\nFEINGOLD: Switching to another area, should a law called the McCain-Feingold law pass and come to the president's desk and he signs it, will you vigorously support that law in your role as attorney general in terms of its constitutionality, your role in advising the solicitor general?\nASHCROFT: Well, there are lots of things that I disagree with that I believe it would be the responsibility of the attorney general to defend vigorously in court. I have to look at specific legislation with that in mind.\nI disagreed in policy on that bill, but I believe it's most--it would be hard for me to imagine that the bill does not survive the kind of scrutiny which would provide an instruction to the solicitor general to defend the bill in every respect.\nI failed to support the bill because of policy reasons and reservations about the Constitution, but I had not concluded that it couldn't survive muster. And I would expect, depending on the bill, how it comes out, it's my responsibility to defend the enactments of the United States Senate.\nThere's another little caveat on that. If the enactment of the United States Senate seriously impairs the prerogative of the executive, that presumption in favor of Senate and House abates somewhat. And that was true as it related to this Justice Department, which had a different view of the line item veto than did many members of the Senate and the House.\nPardon me. I've misspoken again. I was thinking of my time as a senator, and I correct myself. I'm sorry to have done that.\nBut I would expect to defend the laws enacted by the Congress vigorously. And I wouldn't see any reason to expect that McCain-Feingold or Feingold-McCain--pardon me, sir--would be any different.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nAnd as I announced earlier, the distinguished senator from Iowa, wearing his hat as incoming chairman of the Finance Committee, has been at the hearing for the secretary of the treasury this morning. And he has been able to come back with us, and I understand there's no objection for him to ask his questions at this point.\nGRASSLEY: First of all, to the chairman and to my colleagues, allowing me this special privilege to probably go out of turn, I appreciate very much the opportunity and want to congratulate the attorney general-designee on the forthrightness with which you have answered questions thus far. And I have only heard more on television than have heard in person, but I think you're doing what needs to be done, and that is to show your ethical and moral uprightness, and that is to do what the oath of office requires.\nAnd you're trying to quell the concerns of the members of this committee, as you should, and I think that you're doing it adequately. And I hope as time goes on, more members will feel your sincerity.\nFirst of all, there's already been some questions on antitrust asked. One was on airlines, mergers and the enforcement of the antitrust laws in regard to that, so I'm not going to get into that area. But I do want to associate myself--I think it was Mr. Kohl, my staff told me, that had asked those questions. I want to associate myself with those concerns. I'm sure that those are concerns, being from small-town Missouri as you are, you understand the same concerns that we have in Iowa.\nI would also start with the issue of agricultural antitrust, agribusiness antitrust. And here, again, I think serving with you in the United States Senate and knowing a large part of Missouri's economy is agriculture, I'm sure you have sympathy towards some of the things I am going to ask. But at the same time, I know that we have antitrust laws that are 110 years old and to some extent I think that they need to be amended. But that's not really so much the issues I'm going to discuss with you, but how you look at the existing law.\nI'm extremely concerned about increased agribusiness concentration: reducing market opportunities, obviously, fewer competitors in the marketplace and then, consequently, the inability of farmers and producers to obtain fair prices for their products. I've also been concerned about the possibility of increased collusive and anticompetitive activity and I know that the farmers in Missouri are also worried about these issues and that you share the farmers' concerns about competition in agriculture.\nThe Antitrust Division of the Justice Department enforces federal antitrust laws. The current administration, while it paid lip service to farmers, really hasn't dedicated time and resources to agriculture competition issues. So I'd like to get a commitment from you, as much as you can give me, understanding you work for the president of the United States, that the Antitrust Division, under your watch, will pay heightened attention to any possible negative horizontal and vertical integration implications of agribusiness mergers and acquisitions that come up for review before your department.\nI'd also like a commitment from you that the Antitrust Division will aggressively investigate allegations of anticompetitive activity in agriculture and that would include agribusiness, a step above the producer of agriculture. Could you give me an assure that the agricultural antitrust issues then--this would just be one question--would be a priority for this Department of Justice, your Department of Justice?\nASHCROFT: Well, I thank you for your leadership in this area. You rightly mentioned that, as a neighbor, when I had the privilege of serving in the Senate, some of the difficult times that producers have faced because of consolidations and mergers, which have limited the sources or the places into which they can sell their products, have been a real challenge, and my record is pretty clear on this.\nI sponsored legislation to try and elevate the understanding of the Antitrust Division in the Justice Department about agricultural issues.\nLegislation would have placed people solely responsible for focusing on agriculture in that position.\nI also would indicate that I'm aware of the fact that there are other agencies that act in this respect. The Packers and Stockyards Act needs enforcement, and we need the right personnel, I think. And at least that has been my position legislatively when I had the privilege of being in the Congress.\nI thank you for framing your question with the understanding that I'll be part of an administration. And when it comes to policy issues, I'll be guided by the administration.\nBut this is a law enforcement issue. And I think it's fair for me to say that I'll enforce, to the best of my ability and with a perspective that understands some of these challenges that I don't think have been thoroughly understood previously in the antitrust evaluations, merger evaluations. At least, I'll want to make sure that they are understood. Whether or not they have been previously is a matter for debate.\nI want people who are assessing proposed mergers and consolidations to not only look on the consumer for impact but to look at the producer for impact because I think competition has to be viewed on a pretty broad scale.\nIt is with that in mind that I will try to work with the antitrust laws to make sure that we continue to have a competitive marketplace for agriculture.\nGRASSLEY: I have already written to the present attorney general and the antitrust division about my concern about the Tysons-IBP merger. And I know that you aren't there yet. You can't do anything about it. And all I can do is urge adequate enforcement of the laws. So I would ask you to take a special look at and, as bet you can today, assure me that the Antitrust Division under your watch will carefully scrutinize this specific transaction so that farmers and consumers can be confident that competition will not be harmed.\nASHCROFT: I am pleased to say to you that I will welcome you letters when I'm--if I am confirmed and if I have the privilege of serving as the attorney general, and that I will give attention to the enforcement of these laws.\nI don't want to make a statement in this hearing today, which would affect the value of these entities in any way...\nGRASSLEY: I know you can't.\nASHCROFT: ... positively or negatively as they are significant enterprises.\nBut my intention is to enforce the law relating to antitrust effectively and appropriately. And can assure you that if you call upon me for status reports or advising me to give matters complete and thorough attention, I'll welcome those communications.\nGRASSLEY: You refer to some special attention that you would give agriculture the extent to which is appropriate in the table of organization. Right now there happens to be a position in the Antitrust Division that focuses specifically on agricultural antitrust issues. This position was created by the former assistant attorney general, Joel Klein, last year. Would you retain that position?\nASHCROFT: You know, I'll be very eager when I get to the department to assess the way the resources are allocated. And I don't want to start to redraw the organizational chart as it now exists. It would be presumptuous on my part; I've not been confirmed.\nI can assure you that I will devote the kind of resources that are necessary to address merger and consolidation issues in the agribusiness community.\nGRASSLEY: Some time ago I requested the General Accounting Office to review the Packers and Stockyards Act enforcement efforts of the Agriculture Department's grain inspection packers and stockyards program that's referred to by the acronym GPSA. The General Accounting Office found that the Clinton administration, despite official warnings and internal recommendations made both in 1991 and then again in 1997, had not made critical changes to GPSA's administrative structure and staff as recommended in these two previous reports; one, previous General Accounting Office report; a second one, the inspector general within the Department of Agriculture.\nSo then we have a General Accounting Office as much as eight years later saying, \"You didn't do what we told you to do way back then.\" As a consequence, we find the U.S. Department of Agriculture being very ineffective in carrying out its statutory responsibilities to prevent anticompetitive practice in the livestock industry.\nYou happened to join me in introducing a bill which mandated implementation of the General Accounting Office report's recommendation to strengthen the U.S. Department of Agriculture's packers and stockyards program within a one-year timeframe, so that's law.\nOne of the legislation's provisions requires that what, hopefully, will be your department, the Justice Department, is to assist the U.S. Department of Agriculture in investigating livestock competition violations and enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act during the timeframe of implementing those recommendations.\nWould you be sure that your Justice Department carries out the requirements of that law?\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nGRASSLEY: In addition, could you assure me that the Department of Justice will consult with the packers and stockyards division as it formulates effective competition policies and procedures to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act?\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nGRASSLEY: Now I'd like to move on to another interest of mine, because I got legislation passed in this area maybe 15 years ago, and this law, called the False Claims Act, is always under attack.\nAnd this is not something to answer, but I want you to be aware of people in the health care industry, people in the defense industry who will be trying to, through your department, get you interested in amending this act. And if they follow the procedures of the last seven or eight years that they've been trained to do this, as simple as it might sound, the end result is gutting the impact of this legislation.\nAnd this legislation, for instance, in the last month or so, produced an $843-million recovery of fraudulent use of taxpayers' money that went back to the Treasury.\nWell, I talked to you privately about this in my office, and so I said I would ask some questions for the record. This act is under constant attack.\nNow, the Justice Department can file its own suits, or you can join qui tam-type suits under this legislation.\nThus, you as attorney general would be in charge of a good bit of legislation involving the False Claims Act. In fact, all that you want to be involved in, what you don't want to be involved in, a private citizen can bring, and they can do that even if the Justice Department does not intervene. And then, consequently, they are entitled to a share of any judgment or settlement as an encouragement for them to bring forth information about the taxpayers money being wasted.\nI would ask one question. I'm concerned that the key people that you will include on your team, meaning the political appointees of the department have a positive attitude toward the False Claims Act. I am referring to the deputy attorney general, the associate attorney general, the solicitor general, and most importantly, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Division.\nBefore I ask the question, at times during the last eight years that I asked these very same people who were being appointed by President Clinton the constitutionality of the act had not been tested by the Supreme Court. It has been tested and the constitutionality upheld. So previously when I asked questions, I was asking them if they would defend the constitutionality of it. Soon the message got through and I got the message that they would defend it, and they did defend it. And consequently, thank God, the courts backed it up.\nSo now, I'm asking you that we have the constitutionality of it in place, that you will simply see that your people don't do any destructive action to what is already constitutional.\nASHCROFT: Senator, I believe that the law is in place, the constitutionality has been affirmed and we will treat the law with respect.\nGRASSLEY: Thank you.\nOn bankruptcy, President Clinton vetoed a very important bankruptcy reform bill at the end of the last Congress. Senator Torricelli and I introduced that in a bipartisan way. It passed with a veto-proof margin. But it was pocket vetoed so we didn't have a chance to override.\nI hope to reintroduce that legislation in the next few weeks. I anticipate that bankruptcy reform will continue to enjoy broad support in the Congress. Could I count on you to be an ally in getting the executive branch to support this bill and to work with us in Congress to finally get it enacted?\nASHCROFT: Senator, you well know that during my time as the United States senator, when I had an enactment responsibility not just an enforcement responsibility, I supported the legislation and worked to achieve its passage. In terms of determining an agenda, I will work closely with the president of the United States, but I will advise him privately to the best of my ability to help him achieve the agenda that he pursues.\nAnd if the president were to agree to pursue this course of action, I would have no difficulty whatever in advancing and supporting this measures.\nGRASSLEY: Could I please ask one question? It will just be a short answer, because it's on bankruptcy, but...\nLEAHY: The chair will give extra time. Go ahead.\nGRASSLEY: Well, just a little while. Now, without the reform bill, the Justice Department, through the executive office of the U.S. trustees, has the power to dismiss bankruptcies that are abusive under Section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code. This administration hasn't made this a priority. Would you direct the executive office of the U.S. trustees to make enforcement of Section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code a priority?\nASHCROFT: Senator, this is not an area of expertise for me, and I would have to study this and confer with you and ask for advice from people in the department before I could make a determination about it. I simply have not studied this. And this is an \"I don't know\" answer.\nGRASSLEY: OK. Well, what I'll do is I'll follow up with you, because you will study it, I know. And then, we'll be able to discuss it.\nASHCROFT: If you ask me to study it, Senator, I can assure you that I will.\nGRASSLEY: Would you please study it? And would you discuss it with me again?\nASHCROFT: I'd be delighted to, Senator.\nGRASSLEY: And it doesn't necessarily have to be before I vote for you for attorney general.\nASHCROFT: Well, that's good to know. Thank you.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: In case the nominee is keeping count--I thank the senator from Iowa. I know he's trying to juggle two important things today, and I appreciate it.\nI was thinking, we'll go to one more Democrat and one more Republican, and we have two of our--well, one former colleague and one current colleague here. I thought we'd have the two members do their questioning. That would be Senator Schumer and Senator DeWine.\nASHCROFT: And if the president were to agree to pursue this course of action, I would have no difficulty whatever in advancing and supporting this measures.\nGRASSLEY: Could I please ask one question? It will just be a short answer, because it's on bankruptcy, but...\nLEAHY: The chair will give extra time. Go ahead.\nGRASSLEY: Well, just a little while. Now, without the reform bill, the Justice Department, through the executive office of the U.S. trustee, has the power to dismiss bankruptcies that are abusive under Section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code. This administration hasn't made this a priority. Would you direct the executive office of the U.S. trustee to make enforcement of Section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code a priority?\nASHCROFT: Senator, this is not an area of expertise for me, and I would have to study this and confer with you and ask for advice from people in the department before I could make a determination about it. I simply have not studied this. And this is an \"I don't know\" answer.\nGRASSLEY: OK. Well, what I'll do is I'll follow up with you, because you will study it, I know. And then, we'll be able to discuss it.\nASHCROFT: If you ask me to study it, Senator, I can assure you that I will.\nGRASSLEY: Would you please study it? And would you discuss it with me again?\nASHCROFT: I'd be delighted to, Senator.\nGRASSLEY: And it doesn't necessarily have to be before I vote for you for attorney general.\nASHCROFT: Well, that's good to know. Thank you.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: In case the nominee is keeping count--I thank the senator from Iowa. I know he's trying to juggle two important things today, and I appreciate it.\nI was thinking, we'll go to one more Democrat and one more Republican, and we have two of our--well, one former colleague and one current colleague here. I thought we'd have the two members do their questioning. That would be Senator Schumer and Senator DeWine.\nThen, we'll hear from Senator Collins and former Senator Danforth.\nSenator Schumer, you're recognized. And then we'll break for lunch.\nSESSIONS: When do I get to talk?\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: Well, we wanted you to be special.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSo we thought probably as soon as we come back from lunch--we have senators to go. I mean, we got Senator Durbin hidden down here at the end, too. And you have two more down there. So we--and Senator Cantwell and Senator Brownback. And so, trust me you all are going to get a chance. This is not going to be an early evening, I would suggest to everybody here. But when we do break, we'll take a one-hour break.\nGo ahead, Senator Schumer.\nSCHUMER: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Senator Ashcroft.\nYou know, Senator, I sit here and listen to the hearing, and my jaw almost drops. Senator Ashcroft believes Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land. Senator Ashcroft believes that the assault weapons ban should be continued.\nYou know, Senator, we fought a lot of these battles in the Senate over the last two years. Where were you when we needed you?\nAnyway, let me ask a few more of these specifics to flesh out some of these because they are very important.\nThe first question is: When did the law become settled--I guess in your mind, I guess. In 1998, you introduced, along with Senators Helms and Smith, a resolution calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban abortion, even in the cases of rape and incest. And the amendment would also outlaw several of the most common contraceptive methods. In that same year, you said: \"As a legal matter, the absence of any textual foundation\"--this is a quote--\"for the trimester framework established in Roe has resulted in an abortion jurisprudence that is marked by confusion and instability. It demonstrates the dangers of building a legal framework on the quicksand of judicial imagination rather than the certainty of constitutional text.\"\nSo I guess the first question that gnaws at me some is: In your testimony you said it was settled law, and yet fairly recently you were fighting hard to change it, to overturn it--a position I disagree strongly but respect your view on it.\nCan you explain the evolution in the belief?\nASHCROFT: Thank you for the question. We do disagree on this and, obviously, this is one of those questions upon which I believe reasonable people can disagree.\nFrankly, if the law weren't settled, one wouldn't need a constitutional amendment to change it, if one were wanting to change it. And so the fact that I've proposed a constitutional amendment indicated to me that it's not something that's going to be adjusted in another way. And in so doing, that was part of a role that I had as a member of the Senate as an enactor of the law, rather than an enforcer of the law. There are lots of settled laws and there are constitutional amendments designed for the specific purpose of overturning settled laws.\nI think the court has been signaling an increasing--and this makes reference to--I'm forgetting which of the members of the panel asked me earlier. But in its most recent case the court signaled it denied certiorari for reconsideration. And I think the Supreme has said--that's the Stenberg case, I believe.\nSCHUMER: That's what I think, too.\nASHCROFT: It said, we don't want to be bothered with this. Frankly, I think it is not wise to devalue the credibility of the solicitor general in taking things to the court, which the court considers settled. And that's why I explained my other answers the way I did.\nSCHUMER: I appreciate the answer.\nASHCROFT: I just want to indicate that if you think I have changed to believe that aborting unborn children is a good thing, I don't. But I know what it means to enforce the law, and I know what I believe the law is here, and I believe it is settled.\nSCHUMER: So let me ask you this just to follow up. So if the solicitor general came to you and you were attorney general and said I'd like to argue a case to overturn Roe--for instance, in the Nebraska case, in the Stenberg case I think it was Justices Thomas and Scalia who, in dissent, it was just a 5-4 case, encouraged more cases to overturn the law. Would you urge the solicitor general or would you not allow the solicitor general, who would be under your jurisdiction, to bring such a case?\nASHCROFT: I don't think it is the agenda of the president-elect of the United States to seek an opportunity to overturn Roe. And as his attorney general, I don't think it could be my agenda to seek an opportunity to overturn Roe.\nSCHUMER: And would that apply if, let us say--because that was a 5-4 decision, the Nebraska case, the Stenberg case. But let us say one of our Supreme Court justices stepped down and a new appointment was made and it was at least speculated or viewed that that new justice and a different--and one of the justices who stepped down would be one of those in the five majority--that this new justice would have a different view, would have sided with the dissent. Would you still urge the solicitor general to not bring the case?\nASHCROFT: Well, as I said before, I don't think it's the agenda of this administration to do that. And as attorney general, it wouldn't be my job to try and alter the position of this administration.\nSCHUMER: Let me ask you a second one related. Let us say that Governor Thompson becomes the secretary of HHS and he seeks your legal advice on banning stem-cell research, research where we've had great divisions about, but research extremely important to hundreds of thousands of people and their families with Parkinson's Disease and other diseases. Would you urge Governor Thompson, but then Secretary Thompson, given that Roe v. Wade is settled, to continue to allow stem-cell research to continue?\nASHCROFT: I will provide him the best assessment and instruct the Department of Justice to provide him with the best assessment of the law as it exists, upon which he can base a decision within the parameters of the statutory framework guiding his activity.\nSCHUMER: But pursuing that a little, sir, if I might. If you believe Roe is settled and certainly stem-cell research would fall within the confines of the first trimester, then wouldn't your advice have to be to continue stem-cell research? And why couldn't you tell us that here today?\nIf not, then I would like to know what \"Roe being settled\" means.\nASHCROFT: The way I answered the question a moment ago is the way I want to answer it again, but I'll answer it in these words.\nI will be law-oriented and not results-oriented. I will--that's my pledge as I move toward the attorney general's office, and, of course, I can't make good on--I don't want to be presumptuous. I understand that there is a confirmation process. But I will provide my best advice regarding the law, including the law as expressed by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.\nSCHUMER: So, if--just to pursue it a little bit further--and I'm just trying to flesh things out here. I'm not trying to put you on the spot. These are issues of great importance to so many of us.\nIf the legal opinion, the predominant legal opinion, was that stem-cell research was allowed, was part of the settled law of Roe, that would be your guiding light here, not an ideological belief that we shouldn't allow it?\nASHCROFT: I will give them my best judgment of the law, and, if the law provides something that is contrary to my ideological belief, I will provide them with that same best judgment of the law.\nSCHUMER: OK, I'll--I don't think I can push you any further, although I wish the answer would be a little clearer, but...\nASHCROFT: I'm just not going to issue an opinion here.\nSCHUMER: I understand.\nASHCROFT: I will, with all deference, I just want to say...\nSCHUMER: I made it hypothetical that, if the law would agree.\nLet me go to another one. The president asks you advice whether rape victims should be allowed the right to choose--it comes up in some context that we probably, you know--I don't want to--I don't think it's necessary for the purposes of this question to outline the context--would you advise him that rape victims should continue to be allowed their right of choice even though, ideologically, you would be opposed, because, again, Roe is the settled law of the land?\nASHCROFT: If he's asking me for legal advice, I will provide him with my best judgment. It will not be results-oriented; it will be law-oriented. And I will also answer the president in private, as he has requested me to do.\nAnd I don't want to be less than cooperative, but I don't want to try and go through a list of all the potential questions the president might ask me and try and tell in advance someone other than the president what answer he's going to get.\nSCHUMER: Right, but the reason--and I understand that and appreciate your desire to do that. Of course, though, when you say Roe is the settled law of the land, that has lots of different implications that would be quite contrary to the advocacy views that you had while you were United States senator. We would agree to that, right?\nASHCROFT: Well, it's very clear to me that the settled law of the land protects rape victims. I mean, it's clear that the settled law of the land gives virtually anyone any opportunity they want to to have an abortion. I mean, it's an unrestricted right. And I would advise him in that respect as to what the law is.\nSCHUMER: Let me ask you a series now, similarly, on gun control. I was very glad to hear that you would support the continuation of the assault weapons ban which Senator Feinstein carried in the Senate and I carried in the House, so it's obviously important to me.\nI would just like to ask, in terms of the Second Amendment--and while some might not believe it, I believe in the Second Amendment. I do not agree with those who think the Second Amendment should be interpreted almost in a non-existent way, just for militias, and then we should broadly interpret all the others. But, just like you can't scream \"fire\" in a crowded theater, that's a limitation on our First Amendment rights, there are limitations on the Second Amendment as well. And some of my friends believe there should be no limitations, and that's where I disagree with them.\nBut let me ask you this, these four issues, do you think any of them violate the Second Amendment: The Brady law?\nASHCROFT: No.\nSCHUMER: The assault weapons ban? I think you answered that.\nASHCROFT: No.\nSCHUMER: Licensing and registration, which many states obviously have now?\nASHCROFT: I don't believe that--if the Senate were to pass it, I would defend it in court and argue its constitutionality.\nSCHUMER: Argue for its constitutionality?\nASHCROFT: Yes, just so.\nSCHUMER: Thank you.\nNow, how about just your own personal view in a different, you know, on closing the gun show loophole, the Lautenberg amendment? I know you supported a 24-hour closing, but many of us supported a 72-hour because we thought at gun shows 24 hours wasn't enough to do an adequate check, particularly since most of them occur on the weekends. Would you support a 72-hour closing of the gun show loophole?\nASHCROFT: You know, I believe in closing the gun show loophole--what I would like to see us do is to improve our capacity to respond to inquiries a lot more rapidly. I think it's pretty clear that, at least my personal view has been for the past several years, that we need to fully implement our ability to provide instant checking. And I think that's the best way of handling that, and I think doing that is something that is achievable. So my approach to this would be to have the department exercise as much of its energy as it can to close the loophole by virtue of improving our capacity to have instant checks that are reliable, valid and workable.\nSCHUMER: I agree with you. I have no problem with InstaCheck when it's available and when it's working. But in the past, some at least have used the lack of InstaCheck availability in many states...\nASHCROFT: Full party...\nSCHUMER: Let me just finish and I'll flesh out and then we'll go to the next one. Some have used the lack of availability of InstaCheck in many states to stand in the way of a law--72-hour law, longer waiting period, because you just couldn't get the checks out on the computer that quickly, because state records were not up to date. So again, let me repeat, if we found that in a good number of states, and it is the case, that the InstaCheck system were not yet available, would you support a 72-hour wait for closing the gun show loophole, which most of us regard as a rather modest step?\nASHCROFT: Well, the problem with 72-hour wait is that gun shows frequently last about 72 hours, and that's been a problem. In terms of saying that if you're going to provide--no one can buy a gun, that tension, I think, is one that I'd want to respect and I'd try and accommodate that. It's not my desire to shut down this setting.\nIf I'm not mistaken, I might stand correction here, I think when the Juvenile Justice bill came back it had the Lautenberg amendment in it. And I think I voted for the Juvenile Justice bill in that setting and that may be an answer to that question.\nSCHUMER: I think, Senator, and obviously...\nASHCROFT: On final passage.\nSCHUMER: ... we don't want to hold you to every little bit, but I think it never got back from conference. Maybe Senator Leahy...\nASHCROFT: Pardon me, I didn't mean get back, I think I meant--they're telling me I meant final passage. And on final passage, I did vote for it and it had Lautenberg in it.\nMay I just add this little bit?\nSCHUMER: I think what may have...\n(CROSSTALK)\nASHCROFT: Let's clear--I voted for it, I think in that setting. And I'm not sure about that.\nBut what I am sure about is that if it's passed, I'll defend it. And I'll not only defend it, but I'll enforce it, and I'll enforce it vigorously.\nSCHUMER: But in terms of your own opinion, do you think that this 72-hour check--you voted I think, and I--the record could correct me, as well. And I don't want to--you know your record better than I do. I think you may have voted against the amendment, but then voted for the final bill.\nASHCROFT: I think that's correct, sir.\nSCHUMER: Your staff guy is shaking his head yes.\nASHCROFT: Well, you can see him better than I can.\nSCHUMER: So I would trust him.\nASHCROFT: You don't have to turn around to look at him and I do. That's your hard luck, because I don't have to look at him, only in rare instances.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSCHUMER: So has your position evolved any on the 72-hour check?\nASHCROFT: Well, I guess what I'm saying is that my position, as I leave the enactment arena, was mixed. I probably, as a stand-alone provision, voted against it, but wasn't so opposed to it when it came back in the final product that it would stop me from voting for a very important bill. I guess that's a little bit of an academic question.\nNow, the voters of Missouri settled my ability to vote on those bills when I was not re-elected to the Senate.\nI would vigorously defend and enforce the measure.\nSCHUMER: And almost, from point of view of argument--it just follows from the argument, you would not recommend the president veto a bill that had the 72 hour gun show loophole in it? Given that you voted for it in the past...\nASHCROFT: I will advise the president, to the best of my knowledge, on legal matters. They will not be result-oriented; they will be law-oriented advices. But I will give those to him upon his request. And I really want to try and publicly start to hypothetically discuss all the potential of questions he might ask me and try to deliver the advice here first. I just don't think that's proper.\nSCHUMER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: The chair will note for the record that the Juvenile Justice bill, which passed overwhelmingly from the Senate--it went to conference. And we never--other than a symbolic meeting--the conference committee never met. And the Juvenile Justice bill died at the end of the Congress.\nAnd the press accounts, which I believe are accurate, said that it died because it had the gun show loophole in it. If the gun show loophole was taken out, it would be allowed to go forward. With it in, the various gun lobbies said that we would not be allowed to pass it.\nAnd--the senator from...\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, to put a little spin on that a little different. Senator Hatch had a gun show loophole bill that a number of people favored. And I think it passed the first time. On a close vote, the Lautenberg amendment passed, the full Senate voted, and, as I understand it, Senator Ashcroft voted to support the Lautenberg amendment.\nAnd it never came out of conference because that amendment was rejected by the House. The House would not accept it. And your side would not agree to any compromise, and the good Juvenile Justice bill that a lot of us worked on never came out and up for debate. And that's my view of it. But everybody has a different view.\n(CROSSTALK)\nHATCH: Let me add by saying that the fact of the matter is we couldn't get a consensus to pass it. It was that simple, and let's all work to try and get something done this next term.\nLEAHY: Well, the fact of the matter is we never had a conference, so we couldn't seek a consensus, so we couldn't vote.\nHATCH: We knew it was a waste of time.\nLEAHY: I've never been able to predict votes that well.\nHATCH: I've been pretty good about it.\nUNIDENTIFIED: Could we have regular order, Mr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: We haven't had it yet. Why should we start now?\n(LAUGHTER)\nThe distinguished senior senator from Ohio.\nDEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\nSenator Ashcroft, the good news is: When you get to me, you're getting pretty close to lunch here.\nLet me just say that I think most of us here can agree--we're talking about the Juvenile Justice bill--that 95 percent of that bill was, frankly, not very controversial. And let's hope that we can get that Juvenile Justice bill, Mr. Chairman, passed this year.\nSenator, what I would like to do in the time that I have is talk about a few issues that I know are going to be coming in front of you as attorney general.\nThese are issues that I have a particular interest in. I think you do as well. To save time, let me go through them. There are four or five of them, and then if you could comment at the end, I think it'd probably be the simplest way to do this.\nThe first has to do with what is referred to as international parental kidnapping, an issue that I'm very concerned about and an issue that has gotten a lot of publicity in the last few years. And, quite frankly, to be candid, it's an area where I don't think that the current Justice Department has been aggressive enough. And this is something I have said publicly with the current attorney general and we have talked about that. And I would hope that you would be, as attorney general, more aggressive in this regard.\nWhat are we talking about? We're talking about the situation where a U.S. citizen marries a foreign national, they have children or a child, they get divorced, sometimes they don't get divorced. One day the American citizen wakes up and the child is gone, the other parent is gone. The other parent has gone back to his or her country of origin.\nI have noticed, quite frankly, this has not been a priority of the Justice Department. I would hope it would be with your Justice Department. I think it is many times an issue of neglect. It is a question of not setting the right priority. And, frankly, many times, it's a question of ignorance or just lack of understanding of the issue. I think it can be remedied by training with assistant U.S. attorneys across the country, the setting of priorities from the Justice Department and, frankly, coordination with the State Department, because it's an issue that the State Department hasn't been very aggressive in regard to either. That's number one.\nNumber two is an area that I know that you have worked on in the past and I have worked on the past and that is a setting of priorities for the Justice Department in regard to gun prosecutions. I'm talking now about the case where we have a convicted felon, who uses a gun or owns a gun, which is against federal law today. I would hope that the Ashcroft Justice Department would say that this is a priority and that you will go after these individuals as the Bush administration did.\nA related area in regard to guns is when guns are used in the commission of a felony. To be attorney general is to, obviously, as has been said many times here, set priorities. I can't think of anything that's more important to the safety of the public than to get people who use guns in the commission of an offense off the streets. The U.S. attorney can play a very unique and special role in that regard, and I would hope that that would be one of the priorities of your administration.\nA third area is what I refer to as crime technology. It's an area that I've been involved in for, frankly, over a decade now.\nIt is very simple, it is very basic, but it's very important. And that is to make sure that we drive the resources down to local law enforcement, so that not just the FBI but that local law enforcement has access to the good DNA work, has access to automated fingerprints, had access to ballistic comparisons and has access to good criminal records. This is the basics of law enforcement.\nIt is something where the federal government can play a unique role because only the federal government really can give the assistance to all local jurisdictions with the understanding that what happens in Xenia, Ohio, and whether or not we put our records into the system, whether or not we have a good automated fingerprint system, frankly, will affect the ability of the Missouri police to solve a crime, if that defendant happens to go from Xenia to St. Louis.\nThis is an area that you've been involved in, I've been involved in. We passed a bill several years ago that you supported, that I wrote, to provide an umbrella as far as authorization to get this done.\nAnd, quite candidly, I will just ask you to comment on that and hope that when it comes time to present your budget, you would look at that very favorably, because I think it is basic law enforcement that will in fact make a difference.\nThe fourth area is the issue of mental health. We are seeing more and more people in our criminal justice system who have mental health problems. It is something that every law enforcement officer in this country understands and knows about. Part of it has to do with the deinstitutionalization that has occurred in the last few decades, part of it is the nature of society, but it's something that I think in our criminal justice system we have to address.\nWe were able to pass last year a bill that I was involved in writing which has to do with providing some assistance to local courts in regard to mental health. I wonder if you could address that one?\nAnd, finally, I will go back to an issue that has been raised by Senator Kohl--it's also been raised by Senator Grassley and several of my other colleagues--and that has to do with the antitrust enforcement.\nAs you know, I am the chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, ranking member is Senator Kohl. I guess that means Senator Kohl is the chairman this week. He and I have worked very, very closely together on antitrust issues. We think they're very, very important. We think that ultimately they determine our ability to compete in the world and our ability--one of the things that makes us different as a country from other countries is that we have good antitrust laws.\nI am particularly concerned, and I'm not going to ask you to comment about this, because I know that this is something you're going to have to study and I also know it's something you're going to have to work with whoever is the new head of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.\nBut I am very concerned about the consolidation in the aviation industry. This is something I think we have to look at. It is, I think, a potential direct threat to consumers when we are talking about getting down to potentially just three, possibly, major airlines in this country, four. We have some real competition issues.\nSo I would just use this opportunity again not to ask you to comment on it really, because I don't think it's fair for you to comment at this point, but just maybe to put you on notice, this is something that I'm going to be looking at. We're going to hold hearings on our Antitrust Subcommittee within the next few weeks. And we're going to take a very, very close look at that.\nSo, John, those are five issues that I think clearly you're going to be dealing with; five issues that I think, as the attorney general, you will be confronting. And I would just like for maybe some brief comments in the time you have remaining to tell us maybe some thoughts about each one of those.\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator DeWine.\nI must say that, starting with the first issue, the international parental kidnapping problem is one that you have highlighted and you have brought to the attention of America in ways that have been very helpful, I think. Many of us would be in a circumstance not to be very affected by this, and it would be an easy thing to just I suppose overlook. I commend you for your work there.\nI would be very pleased to work with you in this respect. And the idea of making sure that where inter-agency cooperation could be beneficial either through the Department of State or other departments of the government to remedying these tragic circumstances, this is the--since it's not as prevalent as some other problems, I guess some folks don't view it as a serious problem. It reminds me a little bit of Ronald Reagan's definition of a recession. In a depression, it's a recession. If your neighbor loses his job, it's a depression. If you lose your job, if it's your child here, this becomes a national issue very quickly.\nAnd I thank you and look forward to working with you on it. And to the extent that we could enlist other aspects of the federal bureaucracy and the government to act with us to do what's right, I'm very pleased to confer with you.\nGun prosecution: The prosecution of gun violence is very important to me because I think it's essential to public safety. What I think we have is clear indication and evidence that, if we prosecute gun crimes, we have the greatest effect in elevating the safety and security of citizens in this country. And it's one thing to have a law on the books that prohibits certain kinds of gun purchases, and if you have hundreds of thousands of gun purchases that are denied because of it, but then you don't prosecute the people who are denied the purchase for making the illegal attempt, we really haven't done anything but force them into the illegal market.\nIf my memory serves me correctly, there is an Indiana situation where someone had attempted to make an illegal purchase, not prosecuted. Went into the illegal market, acquired a firearm and shot an African-American individual leaving church. That case sticks in my mind.\nI think the context of the gun purchase requirements are very important. In a technical sense, those are against the law, and they're criminal acts.\nBut people who actually perpetrate crimes using guns, obviously, need to be a focus for enforcement effort. The most famous of these is the Project Exile, at least for me--best known for me. If you can drive across the river here, you see the billboard that says you're on notice if you use a gun in the commission of a crime, elevated penalties are going to be a consequence for you.\nAnd it's not just in Richmond, Virginia. I worked hard when I was a member of the Senate to get special funding, additional funding, for U.S. Attorney Audrey Flyseck (ph) in St. Louis, because she has a project called Project Ceasefire. I can't answer, for the details of all these projects, but I think it's largely the same thing. You deal affirmatively, aggressively and constructively to say, we will prosecute those who commit crimes using firearms.\nThird issue--and I look forward to that--I think is the crime technology issue. During my time as governor and attorney general, we sought through the creation of agencies and capacity capability in our state the ability to integrate our effort in a national coordination of data so that we could apprehend criminals.\nThis is a matter of great concern to me because our society is so mobile. And it even has concerned me as it relates to juveniles, because in my home state of Missouri our population is focused on the borders. Kansas City is one of the two largest cities; St. Louis is the other. And we share those borders with other states, and people move back and forth across those borders and the interstate. Availability of information is a very important thing. And to have it available--that kind of moving from one jurisdiction can take place on a bicycle.\nBut criminal activity can move from one part of the county to another part of the county now very easily. And whether it's AFIS, an automated fingerprint identification system, or whether it's the next generation, I think, with DNA identification, and frankly, I think, not only for the apprehension of criminals, but for the establishment of innocence and guilt with greater certainty, I think these are very important matters that relate to civil liberties as well, that I think it's for our system to elevate the integrity and the likelihood that we get the truth when we make a conclusion very important.\nThe mental health area is an important area. Immediately I thought of Senator Feinstein's comprehensive methanphetomine antiproliferation measure, which he and I had the privilege of working together on. It's a $55 million program but there was--a significant part of that was for treatment. When I talk to the prosecutors and the justice officials at the state and local level, they tell me that 70-80 percent of all the people that we incarcerate for criminal behavior committed crimes because they were involved with drugs, substance abuse of one kind or another. I think if we don't understand that remediation of that particular problem is part of this and that it's a mental health-related aspect of this, I think we're kidding ourselves. That's why I was pleased in the measure that we cosponsored and was passed that we had an attention to that aspect of things.\nLast but not least, and I hope I've given these items the direct level of attention, you talk about the Antitrust Division. I will urge the president to appoint an individual who has a capacity to work well in this area. Antitrust is a refined part of the law. I spent some substantial amount of time in antitrust considerations on several issues when I was the state attorney general. And the president, I think, will respond. It happens to be one of the things you'll have a chance to influence because the advice and consent function of the Senate is operative there, and certainly I would welcome your input and the opportunity to confer with you about making a constructive response to that challenge.\nDEWINE: Senator, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Do you have anything else?\nDEWINE: No, that's fine. Thank you.\nLEAHY: Incidentally, some of the press have asked if there's anything symbolic about being in the Caucus Room. I don't mean to deflate anything, but it is more the luck of the draw. We started a system of having committee rooms; the Rules Committee, as Senator Ashcroft knows, assigns where you go.\nThere is a--I think they do it by computer. But in any event, the Foreign Relations Committee, which will be hearing General Powell's nomination, needed a large room. There had been some public and press attention to this hearing, which indicated the need for a large room. We both asked for a large room. This one was being used yesterday for something else. Long way around to say that it's coincidence that we are here. I don't want anyone to draw else wise from it.\nI would ask our colleagues, Senator Collins from Maine, and our former colleague, Senator Danforth, to come forward and join Senator Ashcroft at the table, as I announced earlier.\nOnce they have finished their statements, and any questions that there may be from them, and we will then break for lunch. When we break for lunch, it will be a one-hour break.\nSenator Collins, please, go ahead.\nCOLLINS: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of this distinguished committee. I'm pleased to be here today on behalf of my friend John Ashcroft. And I thank those hearty few who have remained to hear my testimony before you break for lunch.\nLet me begin by saying that if I were to tell the members of this committee that I had a candidate for attorney general who had attended one of the nation's finest undergraduate institutions and law schools, and had served for eight years as state attorney general, eight years as a governor, and six years as a United States senator, I doubt there would be much by way of concern about that candidate's professional experience.\nSimilarly, if I were to point out that this candidate was also an individual of tremendous integrity and high personal values, there would be little doubt that the candidate met the ethical standards for the position.\nThat is exactly the case that we have here with John Ashcroft. Nevertheless, his nomination has generated a controversy noteworthy for its intensity. Given John's record of public service and his personal integrity, it is fair to conclude that the genesis of this controversy is his political philosophy.\nConcerns have been raised that John is simply too conservative to enforce the laws with which he disagrees. In responding to these concerns, let me first make clear that I have disagreed strongly with John on a number of issues.\nOur views on abortion rights, among many other issues, are far apart. But I have absolutely no doubt that John will fully and vigorously enforce the laws of the United States regardless of his personal views. He not only has given me personal assurances but also has testified under oath before this committee that he will do so.\nThis situation is not unique to John Ashcroft. Virtually every attorney general has had to enforce laws with which he or she has disagreed. Our most recent attorney general is no exception, as Senator Thurmond has pointed out. Despite her personal opposition to the death penalty, Attorney General Reno has approved federal death penalty prosecutions in 176 cases. Moreover, a fair examination of John's record shows that, both as attorney general and as governor of Missouri, John has enforced and acted in support of laws with which he has personally disagreed.\nSeveral examples of this have already been provided to the committee on issues ranging from abortion to gambling. Ultimately, this question comes down to our assessment of how John will exercise his judgment. Will he use his discretion wisely, fairly, and appropriately? I would suggest to this committee that the best proof we have that he would do so can be found in the decisions that John made last November. The circumstances surrounding the Missouri election are well-known to all of us. The significance of the seat to the composition of the Senate is obvious. That's why I'm addressing Senator Leahy as Mr. Chairman today.\nAnd the determination with which John campaigned demonstrated how intent he was on winning this race. And yet, when tragedy intervened at the end of the campaign, John acted in a manner that we can all admire, and that was a testament to his good judgment.\nJohn could have pursued a legal remedy for which he had strong grounds.\nAfter all, the Constitution sets forth just three requirements for a United States senator, and the third is particularly relevant in this case. It expressly states that no person shall be a senator who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen. This constitutional requirement would have given John grounds to contest the election, and many legal experts contend he would have prevailed in court.\nDespite his fervent desire to win and despite the fact that the court system was there to provide him with an avenue to continue his quest, John chose not to pursue legal action. Instead, he used his discretion to act in a manner that showed compassion to the family of a political rival and concern for the people of his state--an exercise of discretion that was clearly contrary to his personal, political interest.\nLike many Americans, I was deeply moved watching John's speech when he announced that he was conceding the election and that he hoped that the late Governor Carnahan's victory would provide a measure of comfort for his grieving family.\nDespite the proliferation of the rhetoric surrounding this nomination, I hope that the American people will have the opportunity to learn about the John Ashcroft whom I know. The dignity and compassion exemplified in that graceful act last November displayed the essence of the man with whom we served in this great body.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, in your courtesy in allowing me to appear before the committee today.\nLEAHY: I thank my neighbor from New England and I will assure her that while I appreciate the appellation of Mr. Chairman, I'm making sure I don't get too used to it.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd my former colleague, the senator from Missouri, Senator Danforth.\nDANFORTH: Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you very much for the opportunity to testify.\nI would like to address the one question that has come up repeatedly in these hearings and repeatedly in the media, and that is whether John Ashcroft's philosophical views, whether his political views would in any way circumscribe his ability and willingness to execute faithfully the responsibilities of attorney general of the United States.\nAnd I would like to speak from 30 years, roughly 30 years, of knowing John Ashcroft. I have known him since before he ever got into politics, before he held any public office. John and I and Kit Bond were in Missouri politics, in Missouri government, when we were in our early 30s. And all three of us were holding public office for a time, Kit as governor and John as state auditor and I as attorney general. And we were the reform movement in state government.\nAnd I want to tell you what the nature of that reform was, because I think that it sheds light on the basic question before the committee as to John's ability to faithfully execute his responsibilities.\nWhat we inherited in state government was the old-fashioned spoils system; what we inherited was government that was based on politics. And we began, starting with the state attorney general's office--much smaller, of course, than the Justice Department, but really a comparable office--we began to reform the very nature of state government.\nAnd the reform was that instead of hiring people on the basis of their politics, we would hire people on the basis of their ability. And we would require a day's work for a day's pay. And we would ask people only to interpret and enforce the law. And we would not impose political views on them.\nSo we didn't ask people what their politics were. And I have spoken to a law partner of mine who worked for John Ashcroft and asked him whether the rule that I had when I was state attorney general was the same as John Ashcroft's. And indeed it was. He said he told me about a colleague of his in the attorney general's office who admitted to John, \"I'm a Democrat.\" And John said to him, \"That's not relevant to this.\"\nNow, I think that this an important point to make because it seems to me that someone who is just absolutely bent on superimposing his political views on an office would at least ask people about their politics before he hired them. And John did not do that.\nAnd then in the operation of the office itself, the same law partner of mine, who served with John, circulated a letter that was addressed to Senator Hatch, and I want to submit the letter for the record. It's signed by 18 people who served as lawyers on John Ashcroft's staff.\nAnd the lawyer who circulated the letter told me he could have gotten many more signatures, but he got 18 and sort of ran out of time. But here is the letter that he addressed to Senator Hatch.\n\"Dear Senator Hatch: The undersigned are former assistant attorneys general for the state of Missouri, who served in that capacity during John Ashcroft's tenure as Missouri attorney general. We are writing to state for the record that, during our time in these positions, John Ashcroft never interfered with our enforcement or prosecution of the law and never imposed his personal political beliefs on our interpretation or administration of the law we were entrusted to enforce.\"\nThat's how he operated that attorney general's office, and I have no doubt that he would do the same in the Justice Department.\nI think it has already been referenced in this hearing, but it is, I think, a very good example of how John approached his job in Jefferson City. In 1979, then Missouri Attorney General Ashcroft issued a legal opinion on whether religious material could be distributed on property of public schools, his opinion clearly distinguished between his personal views and his legal analysis. He wrote, \"While the advance of religious beliefs is considered by me and I believe by most people to be desirable, this office is compelled by the weight of the law to conclude that school boards may not allow the use of public schools to assist in this effort.\"\nSo for John, the weight of the law determined his conduct in office, and not his personal thoughts about desirable actions.\nFinally, I'd like to say this based on 30 years of knowing this person: I think it was Senator Schumer who asked yesterday, you know, after all this history as a member of the Senate and fighting all these battles, how can you turn it off as attorney general? I think the same kind of question is asked to a lot of lawyers. If you're a lawyer, how do you turn off your personal feelings? How do you discharge your responsibility zealously to represent a client? It's a matter really of legal ethics, and it's a matter of how the system works.\nBut when John Ashcroft yesterday in that very dramatic moment raised his hand and said, \"When I swear to uphold the law, I will keep my oath, so help me God,\" I would say to the committee that any of us might disagree with John on any particular political or philosophical point, but I don't know of anybody, and I've not known anybody in the 30 years I've known this person who has questioned his integrity. That is a given. And when he tells this committee and tells our country that he is going to enforce the law, so help him God, John Ashcroft means that.\nThat's exactly what he's going to be doing.\nSo I think that the answer to the question, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, would his political or philosophical views circumscribe his responsibility to execute faithfully the duties of the office of attorney general of the United States, the answer, in my mind, is absolutely certain: He would in no way superimpose his views on the duties of that office.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Danforth. And you've had the unique opportunity of testifying in a nomination hearing twice now in this committee room--once as a senator and, second, as a former senator.\nAre there any questions of either of the senators? Any questions either side?\nThen we will stand recess until 2:09.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: The distinguished senior senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, is recognized.\nDURBIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, welcome, again, to the committee.\nOn the day of your nomination you called me and we talked about this day, and I told you that my first concern was over the Ronnie White nomination for federal district court judge in Missouri. I will have to tell you, Senator, that this has been a bone in my throat every since the day that it happened. I have said this to the press and I've said it to you personally: I think what happened to Judge Ronnie White in the United States Senate was disgraceful.\nI am sure that you are well-aware of Ronnie White's background, but for the record at this hearing, I would like to say it so that it's here for all to understand. Ronnie White was the first African-American city counselor in the city of St. Louis. He was the only African-American judge on the Missouri Court of Appeals. He served three terms in the Missouri House, was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the Ethics Committee. He became the first African-American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court in its 175-year history.\nIt was so significant the St. Louis Post Dispatch said that his appointment was, quote, \"one of those moments when justice has come to pass,\" close quote.\nAt his swearing-in ceremony, it took place in the old courthouse in St. Louis. Having grown up across the river in east St. Louis, I know the history of that building. That was a building where the Dred Scott case was tried twice and where slaves were sold on the steps of the courthouse. That was a man who was elevated to the Missouri Supreme Court, Ronnie White. That was the context of his elevation.\nAnd as I look at your decision to oppose his nomination, which led to a party-line vote defeating him, I am troubled. I'm troubled by what I think is a mischaracterization of Ronnie White's background, his temperament, his judicial training, his experience on the bench. He came before this Senate Judiciary Committee and said, with a question from Senator Hatch, that he supported the death penalty. When you spoke against Ronnie White on the floor of the United States Senate, you suggested that he was pro-criminal.\nWell, I might suggest to you that the facts tell us otherwise. In 59 death penalty appeals, which Judge White reviewed while on the Missouri Supreme Court, he voted to uphold the death sentence in 41 cases, 70 percent of the time. The record also reflects that Judge White voted with the majority 53 times, 90 percent on the death cases before the Missouri Supreme Court.\nHis decisions were affirmed 70 percent of the time, a significantly better record than his predecessor, who was affirmed 55 percent of the time, a gentleman whom you appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court.\nAnd then there was the Kinder (ph) case, which raised the question as to whether a judge could be impartial; a judge, who, days before a decision relative to an African-American, made disparaging racial comments in public. You said that the case there was about affirmative action and that it was Judge White's commitment to affirmative action that led to his decision to dissent in that case. In fact, Judge White expressly said in his decision that the judge's position on affirmative action was irrelevant and what was relevant was what Judge White characterized as \"a pernicious racial stereotype.\"\nIt's interesting that after you defeated Judge White--the Senate voted him down--the reaction across Missouri. The 4,500 members of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police wrote: \"Our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely would have been proven to be an asset to the federal judiciary.\" It has come to light that your campaign organization contacted law enforcement officers to enlist them in your crusade against Ronnie White, most of them refused. In fact, the largest organization expressly refused.\nI find it interesting that this man, who was so important in the history of Missouri, had such an extraordinary background as an attorney, legislator and a jurist, somehow became the focus of your attention and your decision to defeat him. One of the statements made by one of your supporters should be a part of this record. Gentry Trotter, a Missouri Republican businessman and an African-American, who has been one of your fund-raisers for many years, resigned from your campaign after the vote on Judge White.\nTrotter said in a letter to you that he objected to, quote, \"your marathon public crucifixion and misinformation campaign of Judge White's record as a competent jurist.\"\nMr. Trotter wrote that he'd never met White, but he suspected that you chose, in quote, \"a different yardstick,\" close quote, to measure his record.\nSenator Ashcroft, did you treat Ronnie White fairly?\nASHCROFT: Senator Durbin, let me thank you for your candor in this matter. I did call you either the day or the day after the president nominated me for this job, and you expressed to me as clearly then as you have now your position. And I appreciate that, and I appreciate your feelings in this case.\nI believe that I acted properly in carrying out my duties as a member of the committee and as a member of the Senate in relation to Judge Ronnie White.\nI take very seriously my responsibility. Pardon me, let me amend that. I no longer have that responsibility. I took very seriously my responsibility as a member of the Senate, and I don't mean to say that I still have that responsibility.\nJudges at the federal level are appointed for life. They frequently have power that literally would allow them to overrule the entire Supreme Court of the state of Missouri. If a person has been convicted in the state of Missouri, but on habeas corpus files a petition with a U.S. district court, it's within the power of that single U.S. district court judge to set aside the judgment of the entire Supreme Court of the state of Missouri. So that my seriousness with which I addressed these issues is substantial.\nI did characterize Judge White's record as being pro-criminal. I did not derogate his background. I'm not as familiar as you have made us all with his background. It was not my intention to interfere with his background or discredit his background, and, frankly, it's not my intention to comment on his membership on the Supreme Court of the state of Missouri because that's a different responsibility and that's a different opportunity.\nNot a single Republican voted for Judge White because of a substantial number of law enforcement organizations that opposed his nomination.\nDURBIN: How many?\nASHCROFT: Well, I know that the National Sheriffs Association did.\nDURBIN: The Missouri Federation is one group and they represent, I think, 70 municipalities. The larger group, the Missouri Chiefs of Police, including the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City, refused to accept your invitation to oppose him. Some 456 different law enforcement authorities came to the opposite conclusion you did as to whether Judge White was pro-criminal. Does that give you pause?\nASHCROFT: I need to clarify some of the things that you have said. I wasn't inviting people to be a part of a campaign.\nDURBIN: Your campaign did not contact these organizations?\nASHCROFT: My office frequently contacts interest groups related to matters in the Senate. We don't find it unusual. It's not without precedent that we would make a request to see if someone wants to make a comment about such an issue.\nOf the sheriffs in Missouri, 77 of them signed a letter to me saying that I should be very careful in this setting because they had reservations about the way in which Judge White had been involved in a single dissent in regard to the Johnson case.\nDURBIN: Senator Ashcroft, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the Missouri Police Chiefs Association, representing 465 members across the state, including the police chiefs of St. Louis and Kansas City. Their president, Carl Wolf, in an article that appeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on October 8, 1999, said his group had received a letter from your office dealing with White's decisions in death penalty cases. He said, he knows White personally, has never thought of him as pro-criminal. He said, \"I really have a hard time seeing that White's against law enforcement. I've always known him to be an upright, fine individual, and his voting record speaks for itself.\"\nASHCROFT: I would be very pleased to continue to respond to your question. As it relates to my own objections, I had a particular concern with his dissents in death penalty cases. Judge White has voted to give clearly guilty murders a new trial by repeatedly urging lower standards for proving various legal errors.\nDURBIN: In which specific cases?\nASHCROFT: Well, let me begin to address a case. In the Johnson case, Missouri v. Johnson, the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed four death sentences for one James R. Johnson, who went on a shooting rampage in California, Missouri.\nThis was during the time...\nDURBIN: Senator Ashcroft...\nASHCROFT: ... I was governor of the state.\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, I think the witness needs to be entitled to answer the question. He's been interrupted about five times.\nDURBIN: Well, I'm anxious to have a complete record, but I also want this to be an exchange in dialogue as opposed to a complete speech on one side. I am familiar with the case and I've read it.\nI'd like to ask you a specific question about the case.\nASHCROFT: Well, you've made a number of statements, Senator, and obviously I'm not running this hearing, but I would like to have the opportunity to respond to those statements.\nDURBIN: Please do.\nASHCROFT: And I think it's fair to put the situation in context. I was going to talk about some other items that you mentioned, about the statistics of his dissents. He had four times more dissents than any of the other--than the Ashcroft appointees to which comparisons have been made on the case. And, frankly, I think it's important to note that just statistical numbers about the times you say guilty or innocent doesn't really prove anything. I mean, if we both took a true-false test, we might have equal numbers of trues and falses, but you might score 100 and I might score a zero.\nBut he obviously--and the first case that I would mention is the Johnson case, the Johnson case with the multiple murders. The sheriff's wife was shot while she was conducting a Christmas party for her, I think, church organization, five times. The murderer shot three law enforcement officers, killing three other law enforcement officers, I believe, and then wounding another law enforcement officer. And the defendant in the case had pleaded--not had plead, but had confessed completely to the crime in a statement that alleged no difficulties or no problems. So that when the case finally was litigated, it was clear that there was no question about whether or not he conducted himself in a way which was somehow excusable.\nDURBIN: Senator, didn't the dissent from Judge White come down to the question of the competency of his counsel? And didn't Judge White say expressly in that decision that if he is guilty, then, frankly, he should face the death penalty? There was no question about it.\nBut if you've read the case as I have, I cannot believe that you would have hired--or would hire if you're appointed attorney general for the United States--the defense counsel in that case to represent our country. The man was clearly lacking in skill in preparing the defense, and that is the only point made by Judge White.\nASHCROFT: Well, I think that being the only point, it's an inadequate point to overturn a guilty verdict for four murders.\nDURBIN: So the competency of counsel in a death penalty case you don't believe is grounds for overturning?\nASHCROFT: It's part of the necessary grounds, Senator, but I believe mere incompetency of counsel, without any showing of any error or prejudice in the trial against the defendant, does not mean that the case should be overturned. And if you'll read carefully--and I believe you would come to that conclusion--the opinion of the court here, you'll find that the disagreement in the case was what weight incompetency or alleged incompetency should have and the extent to which the trial should be set aside if there isn't any real evidence that the incompetency or the mistake affected the outcome.\nDURBIN: Well, Senator, clearly we see this differently, because I am proud that my Republican governor in my state--even though I support the death penalty, as you do, my Republican governor in my state has declared a moratorium on the death penalty. I think he has taken the only morally coherent position, that if we find DNA evidence that exculpates an individual, or if we find a clear case of a capital case where there is evidence of incompetent counsel, it raises a serious question as to whether or not that defendant was adequately represented. And I think that's the point Judge White made.\nASHCROFT: Well, I commend your governor for following his conscience in that respect. I think that's an option for each governor and each person in that setting to make a judgment on.\nAnd I want to make it clear, defense counsel in the Johnson case decided to advance a theory of a post-traumatic syndrome for an individual who had been involved in Vietnam at one time. It was in so advancing that theory, they alleged that the defendant had set up a perimeter of string and tin cans around his house to alert the defendant of anybody coming in, and also that the defendant had flattened the tires on his own car, so as to avoid someone coming in to take his car and use it against him.\nWhen the defense counsel alleged this, they sought to prove that he still thought he was back in Vietnam. Truth of the matter, is he hadn't done that at all.\nDURBIN: That was the point that Judge White made.\nASHCROFT: That is the point.\nDURBIN: That any competent counsel would have established the police had put in the perimeter. And the defense counsel's defense of mental incapacity was based on a fact that he had not checked on. Incompetent counsel in a death penalty case.\nI will just say to you, Senator--we've run out of time here--but for you to reject Judge White based on that decision on that important issue of competent counsel in a death penalty case, troubles me greatly. This is an extraordinary man with an extraordinary background. I think he was treated extremely poorly by the United States Senate, and I'm troubled by that.\nI yield to the chairman.\nLEAHY: Do you have anything further to say on this? If you wish.\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, I think that it's important for us to understand that alleging a mistake at trial is not enough. We should show that the mistake at trial made a difference or was very likely to make a difference. And there is a standard such in the law of the state of Missouri and there is such a standard in the law of the United States of America. And it's pretty clear that that standard was something that Judge White thought simply should be swept aside.\nAnd that's not my view, that's the law.\nNow, the consequence of ruling as Judge White would have ruled in that case, was this: If you and your attorney concoct a lie and it succeeds, you win. But if you and your attorney concoct a lie and it fails, it's incompetency in your counsel and you lose, but you get a new trial.\nI think we have to look at the result of these cases. Now, I am prepared to talk about a number of other cases that Judge White ruled in and discuss his positions there.\nUnfortunately, they're not any less grisly than the four murdered law enforcement officials and their relatives. They reflect, in my judgment, an approach which, if you're one or two of the dissenting judges on the court in Missouri, it doesn't make a difference in the ultimate outcome. But if you turn out to be the sole judge in the federal district court, you have the ability to erase a guilty verdict and provide that a person, once adjudicated guilty for these crimes, is no longer guilty.\nNow, I know of no regime anywhere that says merely the detection of an error at trial without measuring its impact--anywhere in the law where that's in effect. And I don't think it should be in effect here.\nI believe this is very serious. I believe it's very important. But I don't think there was any reasonable likelihood that the defendant who went in and confessed completely his crimes without reference to any difficulty and without any evidence of involvement in a situation where he was out of control, in a flashback in Vietnam, could later on expect that defense to be sustained.\nDURBIN: What I might say, Mr. Chairman, in conclusion here, if I might. It appears that your conclusion about Justice Ronnie White is a conclusion that is not shared by the law enforcement community of the state of Missouri. A man who has an extraordinary background was given, I think, shabby treatment by the Senate because of your instigation, Senator Ashcroft. And I think that is troublesome.\nLEAHY: Senators, we will, I'm sure, come back to this issue more, and I will extend extra time to the senator from Alabama who has been patiently waiting.\nSESSIONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd I welcome you, John, back to the pit. You've been doing a tremendous job, and how you can remain cool and thoughtful when we switch from subject to subject, many of them most complex and many over quite a number of years, is really a tribute to your intellectual capacity and your clear thinking, and I appreciate that. And I think anybody who's watched this hearing from the beginning will see that you have confronted honestly and directly every allegation or complaint and have explained them in a way that makes sense to them and makes sense to me.\nAnd I believe the American people owe you that. I believe this committee owes you that. I believe--I know that there are groups who care a lot about it and have every right to raise issues and complain and ask questions. That's part of this process. I'm sure it's not fun, but it is part of it. And we have to go through that, and I value that.\nI would just call, to my friends on the other side, their attention to the fact that sometimes there are conservative groups that attempt to impose views on how a vote should go in this committee. Our chairman, Chairman Hatch, has been approached a number of times to do this or do that on behalf of groups, and he has said, \"No,\" that he is the chairman of this committee and he alone bears a responsibility for making those decisions. And he has conducted it with great integrity and has been able to keep a proper distance from outside groups who might try to dictate an outcome of a hearing, because it's our duty to get to the bottom of that.\nI'd just say that to start with.\nAnd with regard to Justice White, I know Senator Durbin feels strongly about this, and he's looked at it, but I just don't agree. I'm not--you know, we say this is not a racial question. You voted for every African-American judge that's been up here, but a big point is made of his race. I think you should be treated like any other nominee, and that's what's fair. And he does have an important job now, which he will continue to hold. He's one of seven judges there.\nNow, before I became a senator, I was attorney general two years, but, for 15 years, I spent full-time practicing every day in federal court before federal judges. I have the greatest respect for federal judges. But I can tell you it is a pleasure to go to work before a great federal judge, and I had the rare opportunity to practice before a series of great ones.\nBut a bad federal judge can ruin your day. It can not be a pleasant experience, and they are there forever. And you can go home and you can be so frustrated that you want to scream, but they are there. They will not be removed. I've often wondered how our founding fathers made such a colossal mistake to give a person a job he can never be gotten rid of.\nThe only opportunity the American people have to have public input in who this person will be is at a confirmation hearing. So, I think that's what was done in this case, and serious questions were given to it.\nThere are great powers to a federal judge. They can grant motions, they can deny motions, they can order discovery, they can rule on search-and-seizure issues and those sort of things, some of which you can appeal; many of them either practically can't be appealed or, as a matter of deference the appeals court will give to them, you can't be successful.\nThe great power in a federal judge--one of the greatest powers in the entire governmental system of this United States is the power of a federal judge, at the conclusion of the prosecutor's case, to grant a judgment of acquittal.\nAt that moment, that defendant is freed, jeopardy is deemed to have been attached under the law. He can never be retried no matter how horrible that crime was. Most people don't believe that's true. Trust me, that is the law in America. It is unreviewable power that cannot be appealed.\nAnd so, I think, from the point of view of a prosecutor--and John Ashcroft served eight years as an attorney general--who handles appeals on a routine basis before the Supreme Court, they know the importance of making sure that whatever we do that not on my watch as the United States senator from Alabama will I confirm a judge I believe is not fair to law enforcement. He's not fair to law enforcement, he's not fair to victims; not fair to law enforcement, he's not fair to justice. So this is a big deal, number one.\nThis Johnson case, I believe is also a big deal. Let's sum this thing up. This defendant, a deputy came to his door because of a domestic disturbance, he shot that deputy several times. He laid on the ground moaning. Then the defendant, Johnson, comes out and shoots him through the forehead, murders him there, goes to the home of the sheriff. The sheriff is not there. His wife is in the house with a party or social of some kind going on. He shoots her five times through the window, killing her. Then goes and shoots another deputy. Then goes and lays in wait and shoots two more deputies out trying to do something about this event.\nHe was surrounded, finally surrendered, gave a detailed confession, did not say he was having--he thought they were Vietcong or he thought he was in Vietnam, he was under attack. He had driven from place to place as a matter of fact. He did not give that kind of defense. It was a complete confession.\nAnd the defense attorney, I submit, was in a difficult position. Obviously the prosecutor was not going to agree to a plea bargain of less than death in a case like this. If this isn't a death case, there is never a death case in Missouri. He could not give that death case up. So what would he do?\nSo they came up with a home-run goofy defense that it was post-traumatic stress syndrome. That's what they tried to pull off. And it failed, they were caught in it, the defendant was convicted.\nFrom my understanding they were good lawyers. In fact, there was a hearing at a later date on the competency of the counsel in this case, and they were found to be competent.\nSo they got caught. The truth is that's what jury trials are all about: Who's telling the truth, the defendant or the prosecuting witnesses? They concluded that he was not telling the truth. It was a false defense and they rejected the defense. That happens every day in court all over America.\nNow we're going to create--what Judge White did and why it was big time significant was he created a circumstance in which you encourage a defense lawyer to try the most outlandish defense scheme to see if they can get away with it. And if they don't get away with it and get caught, they could ask for a new trial for the defendant.\nThat's why this is a big deal.\nAnd I did not like the language that he used that, \"Well, maybe this is not insanity,\" Judge White wrote. He said \"it's something akin to insanity.\" Now, we've got some real problems in this country over getting a clear definition of insanity. After the Hinckley shooting of President Reagan, this Congress dealt with and confronted that difficult question and come up with a much more clear rule for federal court.\nTo me, his opinion indicated a lack of fully comprehending the importance of a clear definition of insanity in that case, in addition to violating the established law about ineffective assistance of counsel.\nAnd in the exchange, Senator Durbin, between you and Senator Ashcroft, I don't think you do dispute that it is the established law that you must show not only ineffectiveness--which I suppose you could say this was ineffective, since he tried a defense that didn't succeed, but what other defense did he have? But, secondly, if it was ineffective from that technical point of view, you don't dispute that it has to have an impact on the outcome of the trial.\nSo, that's the established law, I believe, in America, as Senator Ashcroft has articulated, and that's why I think it was a big error.\nI didn't like the Kinder (ph) case either. I think that was almost a very strange ruling, so that was, to me, significant.\nNow, there was serious concerns about Justice White's reputation for law enforcement effectiveness. Seventy-seven sheriffs in the state signed a petition in opposition to his nomination; that's well over half. I am quite sure many of those were Democratic sheriffs--opposition, writing to Senator Ashcroft, his state senator, opposing that nomination. I think that's very significant.\nIn addition to that, the National Sheriffs Association opposed the nomination. The Missouri Federation of Chiefs of Police wrote, quote, \"We are absolutely shocked that someone like this would even be nominated to such an important position. We're willing to go on record with your offices as being opposed to his nomination and hope you will vote against him.\"\nThe Mercer County prosecuting attorney's office wrote, \"Justice White's record is unmistakably anti-law enforcement. We believe his nomination should be defeated. His rulings and dissenting opinions on capital cases\"--where he did four times as many dissents as his brother justices--\"on capital cases and on Fourth Amendment cases\"--that's the search and seizure, where there's a lot of daily work done there--\"should be disqualifying factors when considering the nomination.\"\nNow, I know that it is no fun, it is a difficult thing in a situation like this to oppose the nomination of somebody who, you know, appears to be a good person in every respect. But a lifetime appointment--that bench is very important. And I think we can do better about it.\nLEAHY: Do you have anything to add to that?\nSESSIONS: Do you agree?\nASHCROFT: I appreciate your clear explanation of the Johnson case. I think what you have to look for in a case is what will be the rule if the opinion of the judge is embraced. The rule in the Johnson case was, is if you try a really whacked-out theory of something and it's revealed as the lie that it is, then you get a new trial because it was an incompetent or ineffective thing to do at trial. If you succeed with it and get them to believe it, you don't need the new trial.\nWhat bothered me about the case was that the judge basically wanted to lower the standard. And frankly, what bothered me about the senator's articulation of the case, in addition to the fact that--well, was that incompetence alone overturns the verdict.\nAs a matter of fact, in the Kinder (ph) case--which is another unpleasant case. I mean, this is another case of a woman who was beaten to death with a pipe, after being raped by a defendant who had been seen with the pipe shortly before the rape, and found with the bloody pipe in his hand after the rape. And the defendant's semen had been found in the victim of the rape. And there was an allegation about a statement that the judge had made prior to the trial, in another setting, that indicated that the judge was a person who was biased against African-Americans. And the defendant and the victim were both African-Americans in the case.\nNow, I don't think there's any question about the fact that judges should ever make statements that reflect racial bias.\nI think swift and sure action should be taken to keep individuals like that from being a part of our judicial system if they are biased.\nBut you have a situation here where there is an alleged bias. I'm not going to debate it. But Judge White said that the alleged bias alone should overturn the murder conviction of that young woman, should set aside the murder conviction, and it didn't matter that there was no error at the trial. None. There was no allegation of any impact of the bias.\nAs a matter of fact, I believe there was a separate review of the trial by authorities to try and find an indication of bias that affected or otherwise was reflected in the trial and had an impact on the outcome, and they couldn't.\nMissouri v. Irvine (ph) is another case. Now this was not about Judge White urging broad, lenient legal rules, but it still caused me great alarm. In order to have a death penalty in Missouri, you've got to be able to say that the crime was committed with cool reflection, torture or depravity of mind, which includes brutality of conduct.\nIn this case, the defendant went to the victim's residence late one night. They appeared to get into an argument. The defendant stabbed the victim, an older man, in the neck and the upper chest and dragged the naked victim out of the trailer, in front of others by something tied around his neck. The victim had been stripped of his clothes in the interim. I think the victim was propped up against a tree.\nAnd the victim said, \"Go ahead, kill me, James.\" At which time the defendant beat the victim in the head four to five times with a brick and walked away. And shortly thereafter, when the victim began to move and to moan, the defendant came back again and beat him in the head with a brick, causing fatal wounds.\nNow, I think there's enough depravity of mind and brutality of conduct in that description to satisfy almost anybody. Almost anybody.\nBut Judge White says, it just barely concur that there's a submissable case of first degree murder here. Well, it's this kind of view, over and over again. There are other cases that I came to the conclusion that this was not a person that I felt should sit in judgment in a setting where the ruling of a single judge could displace the conclusions of the entire Supreme Court of Missouri.\nNow, in these settings where he was the solo or with one other judge in dissent, that's a different circumstance, and I don't comment on that.\nLEAHY: The chair has given the same amount, now, of extra time to both the senator from Alabama...\nSESSIONS: I thank the chair.\nLEAHY: ... and the senator from Illinois.\nSESSIONS: Can I just have one second to wrap up?\nLEAHY: Well, then the senator from Alabama, then, will have more time. Go ahead.\nSESSIONS: I would just want to say that there was a hearing later on these competent counsel. The judge found him competent and, in fact, said they were highly skilled attorneys, devoted hundreds of hours to the defense. They were privately retained attorneys, not public defenders. They were professional trial lawyers with extensive experience. One had been a leader in the criminal defense bar, another had graduated with Judge White from college. They were all three competent and capable attorneys trying to make the best defense in a difficult circumstance. And I don't think they should be rewarded for failing in that effort.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nI know the senator from Alabama wanted to note the fairness of both the Republican and Democratic leaders.\nSESSIONS: I will note that, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: The distinguished senior senator from Delaware, as I noted before, has been absent because of chairing the Powell hearing. And so, at this point he is able to rejoin us and I yield to him.\nI would also note that the senator from Delaware did not have the three to four minutes of opening statement he would have had yesterday. He's entitled to that, today, as well as his 15 minutes, should he want it.\nBIDEN: I thank the chair. I will try not to take even all the time.\nAnd I do apologize to Senator Ashcroft and my colleagues for not being here. Yesterday, I had the privilege of representing the Senate and giving one of the eulogies for our colleague, Alan Cranston, in San Francisco. And that's why I was not here. And then I am, for a very brief fleeting moment, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And I am chairing the committee on the Powell nomination, as we speak.\nSo that's by way of explanation of my absence.\nI asked the chairman and he was kind enough to put in an opening statement yesterday. I just want to read one paragraph from our opening statement.\n\"You are to become the people's lawyer more than you are to be the president's lawyer. Consequently, questions relating to your nomination is not merely whether or not you possess the intellectual capabilities and legal skills to perform the tasks of attorney general. And not merely whether you're a man of good character and free of conflict of interests that might compromise your ability to faithfully and responsibly and objectively perform your duties as attorney general. But whether you are willing to vigorously enforce all the laws and the Constitution even though you might have philosophic disagreement with them. And whether you possess the standing and temperament that will permit the vast majority of the American people to believe that you can and will protect and enforce their individual rights.\"\nThat was my opening statement in 1984 when I was considering how I would vote on the nomination of Edwin Meese. I cite that only to say that my standard that I've applied--and I told you on the phone, Senator, and I appreciate you calling me and us finally catching up with one another--has been consistent for the 28 years I've been a United States senator.\nMy greatest concern is on questions relating to race. I will try not to tread on the various issues that have been raised here, except to say to you on the last point that I've always applied and that is whether or not the vast majority of Americans will believe that you will enforce the law vigorously on their behalf, is one of my concerns here. Not just whether you will, whether you are believed that you will.\nThere are only two places that black Americans and all minorities have, over the last 40 years, been able to go with some sense of certainty that their rights would be vindicated and aggressively pursued. One has been the federal courts and some state courts, but primarily the federal courts. The other has been the Justice Department. And I sincerely wish, John, you had been nominated to be secretary of defense, or secretary of commerce, or secretary of state, or secretary of anything but this single job as attorney general.\nI will, as not unusual for me, be pilloried by the right and the left for saying this. I find you a man of honesty and integrity. As I said to you, I think you are the classiest person in the last election, the way you bowed out of your race. You did it with class and dignity that was not seen by many Democrats or Republicans who were in your position. And I've always had a good relationship with you. I think you would agree to that.\nBut I told you bluntly what my concerns were when we spoke and what they are now. For those who suggest that maybe this is a bit of an epiphany, I would suggests that it's been the standard I've applied my entire Senate career.\nAnd I say to folks, it does matter what you're nominated for. For example, if I had--well, let me just say it this way--I'm worried, Senator, about the cumulative weight of items that lend the perception, at least, that you're not particularly sympathetic to African-Americans' concerns and needs. Not just the Ronnie White case, which is of concern to me. Not just the voluntary desegregation order, which was obviously a very contentious issue during your tenure back in Missouri. Not merely your appearance at the Bob Jones University. Not merely your strong opposition to Bill Lann Lee to be the head of the Civil Rights Division. But there seems to be a--not merely your sponsoring an act called a Civil Rights Act of '97, I think it was, don't hold me to that, which said that no longer could preferences be given in employment and federal contracts.\nThe cumulative weight is what, quite frankly, concerns me. And I raise with you an interview that you did in a magazine--if this has been raised, please tell me, Mr. Chairman, and I'll read it in the record.\nIn the magazine called The Southern Partisan Magazine. That's a magazine to which you gave an interview and it's a magazine that has been characterized by the Associated Press and other mainstream publications as a \"Southern, part neo-Confederate publication that regularly vilifies Abraham Lincoln as a tyrant, helps\" and so and so on--I won't go into all the detail.\nBut a magazine that--excerpts from the magazine that I've asked my staff to get for me, such as \"Negroes, Asians and Orientals, Hispanics, Latins, Eastern Europeans, have no temperament for democracy, never have and probably never will.\"\nOr a 1996 article that came with the following claim: \"Slave-owners did not have a practice of breaking up slave families. If anything, they encouraged strong families to further slaves' peace and happiness.\"\nOr a 1990 journal article, the same outfit, celebrating former KKK klansman David Duke as, \"a candidate concerned about affirmative discrimination, welfare profligacy and taxation holocaust, a popular spokesman for a recapturing of the American ideal.\"\nOr it goes on. After a visit by one of the writers for The Southern Partisan to New York, said, \"Where are the Americans? For I met only Italians, Jews and Puerto Ricans.\"\nAnd the list goes on of these outrageous statements that this magazine carried.\nNow, again, by way of context, it may seem, by itself, unfair to ask you about this. But were I going to be the secretary of interior--were I nominated to be the secretary of interior and I had given a long interview or had--with the outfit that's called the Earth Liberation Movement, the one that goes and burns down any dwelling that is on a federal land in open space, or were I to give interviews to and say some of the things you said about this magazine to the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, if I were going to be head of the Department of Agriculture, I think that most Midwestern senators would have a problem. I think most Western senators have a problem if it were regarding the Earth Liberation Movement.\nWell, I have a problem, coming to this Senate, getting involved in politics because of civil rights. My state, to its great shame, was segregated by law. We have not been very progressive until the '70s in my state on these issues. And so, it bothers me.\nNow, that's a long background to a relatively short question. You gave an interview to that magazine where you said, \"Revisionism\"--and I think you have a copy of this. \"Revisionism is a threat to the respect that Americans have for their freedoms and liberty that was at the core of those who founded this country. And when we see George Washington, the founder of our country, called a racist, that is just a total revisionist nonsense, a diatribe against American values.\"\nWell, so far, so good.\nQuote: \"Your magazine also helps set the record straight. You've got a heritage of doing that, of defending Southern patriots like Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis. Traditionalists should do more. I've got to do more. We've all got to stand up and speak in this respect, or else we will be taught that these people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda.\"\nIn the introduction to that article, they describe you--and you can't be responsible for how you're described, I acknowledge--but in the description of you, it says, \"John Ashcroft has made a career of public service in Missouri. After serving...\" and it goes on and then says, \"that in his short time in Washington, the senator has already become known as the champion of state's rights and traditional values. He's also a jealous defender of national sovereignty against the new world order...\" and so on and so forth.\nNow I have two questions relating to this, Senator.\nOne--actually three.\nOne, were you aware of the nature of this magazine before you gave the interview?\nAnd, two, are you now aware, if you weren't then, of the nature of this magazine?\nAnd, number three, if you are aware now, do you think it was a smart thing to do to give this interview, not just because I'm asking you the question?\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator, and I appreciate the candor of your remarks. I also appreciate the kind things you said about me. And if someday there's a President Biden, maybe you'll consider defense and commerce and those other things for me.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBIDEN: America's in enough trouble right now.\nASHCROFT: Let me make something as plain as I can make it. Discrimination is wrong. Slavery was abhorrent. Fundamental to my belief in freedom and liberty is that these are God-given rights. And we have had the stain of slavery in our past, and I recognize that our nation's history is complicated.\nIt's hard for me to know how Thomas Jefferson could write, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, and that among these is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and, at the same time, be a slave-owner.\nAnd, while he owned slaves, I think his articulation of these freedoms planted the seeds that resulted in ultimately doing away with slavery. And, so, it's complex and complicated.\nOn the magazine, frankly, I can't say that I knew very much at all about the magazine. I've given magazine interviews to lots of people. Mother Jones has interviewed me. I don't know if I've ever read the magazine or seen it. It doesn't mean I endorse the views of magazines--a telephone interview. And I regret that speaking to them is being used to imply that I agree with their views.\nBIDEN: Now, just making clear, John, I'm not saying that. I know you better.\nASHCROFT: OK.\nBIDEN: Speaking to them implies, to me, an incredible insensitivity, number one. Number two, speaking to them, learning who they are, and not condemning them after the fact implies a bit of bull-headedness at the least and a--I don't know what else, but it ain't good.\n(LAUGHTER)\nNo, I sincerely mean this. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. You've got 20 million black Americans out there that you're going to be representing. They're going to look to you and say, \"Is this guy going to enforce the law?\" And then they're going to say, \"Wait a minute, this guy finds out that this outfit is this racist, neo-Confederate outfit that writes things about Jews and blacks and Eastern Europeans and immigration, and he doesn't condemn them. He doesn't condemn them.\"\nI mean, look, we've all spoken to people we wish we hadn't. We've even had people--I remember Jimmy Carter, when he had a picture taken in Ohio, and it turns out to be John Wayne Gasey was in the picture. Remember the--but after he found out it was John Wayne Gasey and he got arrested, Carter said, \"I condemn the guy.\"\nHe didn't say, \"You know, well, I'm not going to really have anything to say. I talked to everybody about these things, and John Wayne just happened to be there.\"\nThat's the part that confuses me, John. I don't quite understand that.\nASHCROFT: Well, I condemn those things which are condemnable.\nBIDEN: Isn't the magazine condemnable? I mean, isn't the magazine condemnable? They sell t-shirts that says, you know, \"The Assassin was Right.\"\nASHCROFT: If they do that, I condemn. I mean, if they sell t-shirts saying that Abraham Lincoln should have been condemned, I condemn that. Abraham Lincoln is my favorite political figure in the history of this country.\nBIDEN: Allegedly, they sold t-shirts that pictured Abraham Lincoln with the words, \"Thus Always to Tyrants\"--the words of his assassin.\nAnyway what I still haven't quite gotten, I still haven't quite gotten why--and by the way a lot goes by in a campaign. We all understand that. We've all been in campaigns. And we all get faced with the proposition, \"Geez, if I disassociate myself with that outfit, even though I don't like him, is that going to raise more questions?\" And I can understand tactical judgments in the middle of a campaign.\nBut what I couldn't understand is why, right after this, and this is called to your attention, you just don't say, \"Boom, boom, boom. I should have never gone to--got a degree from Bob Jones University; I should have never had this interview.\"\nI mean, as you all know, this place loves contrition. I mean I've had my share of having to do it. We all make mistakes. But I don't get it. I don't get it.\nAnd by the way, you know, you're a great supporter of Scalia, as many others are. I mean Scalia said the same things your old buddy did. To illustrate the point, he voted on a case to overturn the death penalty that had imposed on a disgruntled ex-employee of a married couple. The defendant entered the couple's home, shot the wife twice with a shotgun, and then shot and killed the husband. And then when he realized the wife was still alive, he slit her throat and stabbed her twice with a hunting knife. And in the second case, he wrote an opinion reversing the death penalty that had been imposed on a defendant that had raped and strangled a 13-year-old girl. Should Scalia not be on that court?\nThat was a publicized case; I raised it on the floor of the Senate. I happen to think he probably made the right decision under our Constitution.\nBut, you know, what people are looking for is balance. So, I'd have less trouble with Ronnie White if you had gone to the floor when this decision was made and say, \"You know I'm really disappointed in Scalia. He was one of my heroes. He was one of the people I most respected, and look what he just did.\"\nBut nobody says that. Nobody says that. But Ronnie White comes along--I just want you to understand why people are suspect, John.\nPeople are suspect not because they believe--at least to the best of my knowledge--because they believe you are a racist. They don't believe--I don't believe that. I don't believe that. But they're suspect because they believe that your ideology blinds you to an equal application of, not just the law, but the facts. And that's the part that I've told you that troubles me.\nI mean here you got--what would you all have said if I had gone up here and my--I voted for Scalia, as I tell you. He's a great guy. I was once asked, what's the one vote out of over 10,000 I regretted, was voting for Scalia. That was the one I most regret. I tell him that, he jokes about it. I teach a class in constitutional law. When he found out, he called me. He said, \"Joe I got to come up and co-teach that class with you, because you're really probably steering those kids in a different direction they should go.\" Have a good relationship with him and I respect him. But I think he's dead wrong.\nBut if I had stood up and said, you know, \"I'm voting against Scalia for that reason and organize folks.\" I think you all would have said, \"Whoa, wait a minute.\"\nI don't know, John, I guess what I'm trying to get at and it's my frustration, because damn--darn, I'm not looking to vote against you. I mean, this is not a comfortable thing. Just like my friend from Alabama said when he came in, he said, \"You know, it's hard to vote against a guy like Ronnie White. He's a decent, honorable guy. Hard to vote against him. But on the issues he's wrong. He's, obviously, otherwise a decent, honorable man.\"\nBut you know, that old expression we remember from law school, you know, hard cases make bad law. But this is a hard case. And I just wanted you to know my frustrations.\nI wish you were able to be more forthright--not forthright, more direct in your condemnation of things that you know now to be mistaken. And further, I wish you'd understand why--take away the interest groups. I'm not a big fan of interest groups, as you probably know. I don't meet with them anymore, because I don't trust them. With two exceptions, in my experience.\nBut I wonder why--I'll end with this and I'm sorry.\nI hope you'll understand why there's so many--as this stuff comes out, so many average black Americans that sit there and say, \"Geez, I don't want this guy. I don't want this guy. I'm not crazy about having this guy.\"\nI just--if you understand that, because you're probably going to be attorney general. And I hope and you take away nothing from this except, this matters to people, John. Words matters. Word matters. And the less you have the more distraught you are, the less you think you can get representation, the more the words matters.\nSorry, it sounds more like a lecture than anything else. But I don't mean it that way. That's my frustration.\nLEAHY: Senator Ashcroft, do you wish to respond? Obviously, you have time to.\nASHCROFT: Well, thank you very much.\nFirst of all, I want to make very clear that I repudiate racist organizations and racist ideas.\nBIDEN: Is the Southern Partisan Magazine racist in you opinion?\nASHCROFT: I probably should do more due diligence on it. I know they've been accused of being racist. I have to say this, Senator: I would rather be falsely accused of being a racist than to falsely accuse someone else of being a racist. I've told my children I'd rather have my wallet stolen then for me to be someone who steals a wallet.\nBIDEN: I got that, John. But all those folks behind your experts. They knew this was coming up. Didn't they tell you what that magazine was? The guy sitting back to your left--he's done 10 of these. He's forgotten more--he's read every one of those issues. You know it, and I know it. Didn't he tell you, \"Hey, this is a racist outfit\"? I mean, what more do you need to know.\nASHCROFT: No. No. No.\nBIDEN: No?\nASHCROFT: I mean I don't want to be disrespectful, but for you to suggest that I was told that all of these things that you've alleged are true--I wasn't told that. And, frankly, I have been told that some of them aren't true. And I don't know the source of your things, but I'm not here to challenge what the senators on this panel say. I'm here to express myself.\nBIDEN: John, if I'm wrong, you should tell me because I'm operating on this. If it's factually wrong, then I'd be happy to hear what...\nASHCROFT: Well, you know, that's not my purpose. Let me express to you that I believe that racism is wrong. I repudiate it. I repudiate racist organizations. I'm not a member of any of them. I don't subscribe to them. And I reject them.\nAnd had I been fighting in the Civil War, I would have fought with Grant. I probably would have, at Appomattox, winced a little bit when Grant let Lee keep his sword and take his horse home with him. But I think that was the right decision. It was a signal at that time by the people on the ground that they recognized that some people who fought on both sides were people of decent will, and it is not time for us to find out who we should be able to hate now, that there's a long time gone by.\nYou know why we should respect Grant. You know why we should respect Lee. This Congress has acted to restore the citizenship of Robert E. Lee, and there are a series of members on this panel that voted in favor of restoring the citizenship of Robert E. Lee, and at that time they did so, they said the entire nation has long recognized the outstanding virtues of courage, patriotism and selfless devotion to the duty of General Robert E. Lee.\nBIDEN: John, you're good, but this ain't about Robert E. Lee. I just hope when you're attorney general you will understand you've got to reach out...\nLEAHY: Gentlemen.\nBIDEN: I've gone too much.\nLEAHY: Did you have further?\nASHCROFT: Well, I don't mean to be--really, I don't have any purpose for arguing with my friend, and I believe he has a good heart and he has the right motive here. And his question is: Can I serve America as the attorney general of this country, and will people be able to have confidence in me? And I assure him that they will.\nAnd for those that don't have confidence at the ab initio, if we want to go to the law school phrase, they will. Because I will serve, and I will serve well. And if the absence of unanimous confidence in any individual becomes a disqualifier, all we do is to invite groups to signal a lack of unanimous confidence and they paralyze the system.\nI will enforce the law. I reject racism. I will reach out to people, all people and enforce all of the law. And I respect this panel's and this committee's dedication, and I don't have an argument with the senator.\nLEAHY: Gentlemen, we've extended extra time here partly because the senior senator from Delaware was unable--or representing the Senate at a funeral yesterday--was unable to be here, so he had his time from then and today. The witness has had ample chance to answer the question, am I correct?\nBIDEN: He didn't answer all of the things--you know, when a person spend 15, 20 minutes asking a protracted question, it does place on the respondent a need to, sort of, say, \"I want to respond to the nature of the questions and not to all of them,\" and I think I did that.\nI'm not complaining, not asking. I thank the chair for its fairness in this respect, and, if I come up with something else that I think I should say, maybe I'll submit something.\nLEAHY: As I said yesterday, the witness will have--should not to feel in any way that he is cut off, nor senators cut off in questions. If the nominee feels at any time there has not been adequate time to answer, as I said yesterday, we will provide the time. We'll provide the time to go back to any answer that he wants to change, clarify, or add to, and, of course, the record is always open for that.\nAs I stated this morning when I felt that there may have been an error in an answer yesterday, I raised that point. Again, if the nominee doesn't accept that analysis, he will also be given time.\nI want to have as complete a record as possible. I do not want either the nominee to feel that he has not had a chance to answer all the questions that are asked of him as completely as he wants. By the same token, I want to make sure that all senators, both Republican and Democrat, have the opportunity to ask their questions.\nWith that, I'll turn to the senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith.\nSMITH: Mr. Chairman, because of being in and out with another hearing which I was involved in, is it 15-minute period, is that--how much time do we have?\nLEAHY: Have you had--you haven't had a chance. Then you have 15 minutes.\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLet me just say, in terms of watching and participating in the hearings yesterday with you, Senator Ashcroft, and watching how you conducted yourself in response to the questions and the comments, and then again today, my admiration for you is about tenfold beyond what it was yesterday, and it couldn't get much higher yesterday.\nThe way that you have risen above the attacks that have been delivered upon you is remarkable. It's a tribute to you.\nThe fact that a distinguished person like yourself would have to endure comments about racism and segregation and all of the other things that have been said or insinuated throughout this hearing, dredging up racist organization charges and so forth, is really, in my view, demeaning the United States Senate.\nYou know, this--I thought we were going to start off in a spirit of bipartisanship this year and to try to look at things, if we could, on a more even basis.\nJohn Ashcroft, the nominee for this position, has said that he will enforce the law, period. He raised his right hand and took an oath and said, \"I will enforce the law,\" even though I know John Ashcroft well enough to know that if he had the choice on the enactment of some of those laws, they'd be a lot different, if he could have enacted them unilaterally. But he also said, \"I will enforce the law.\"\nThat's what this hearing is about, whether or not you think John Ashcroft will enforce the law. Not enact the law; he had that opportunity for six years here as United States senator. That's not what this hearing should be about. Let's stay focused on what it really is about.\nIt's ironic, too, that where Senator Ashcroft has said that he will enforce the law, even if he'd rather change the law, he would still enforce it. On the other hand, his critics from the left are saying that, \"If you can't agree with my view on the law, you can't be attorney general.\"\nThis is very, very troubling. You could disqualify a heck of a lot of people from being attorney general. One of them was an appointment by John F. Kennedy to the Supreme Court, Byron White, who was pro-life, one of the leading pro-life advocates on the United States Supreme Court. So I guess we would have to disqualify him as well, using that kind of a marker.\nI think this is thin ice that we're on. This is not a Supreme Court nomination; this is the president's Cabinet. And I want to make just a couple of points, Mr. Chairman. I doubt that I'll use the 15 minutes.\nA while back, this morning, former Senator Danforth testified. And he made a very good point, I thought, and I'd just like to expand on it briefly, that as a lawyer--we're talking now about this so-called case before the state of Missouri on the Kansas City case. His point was that, as a lawyer, you have an ethical obligation to vigorously defend your client. That's what you're obligated to do. Every day in America, we defend the most reprehensible people, murderers, rapists, robbers, thugs, every day, as well we should. It's the basis of our entire Constitution. If we ever walked away from that, God help us.\nAnd so I think we would have to disqualify every single lawyer in America who applies the ethical code of his or her state from being attorney general of the United States if we're going to use that marker.\nSo I would hope that we would stay focused here, and say that even to imply, let alone say that somehow a lawyer, in this case the attorney general, who is defending his state, as he's obligated to do by law and by the ethics of his profession--to somehow imply that that comes to racism is outrageous. And especially since some, even on this committee, were involved in supporting, against the opposition of the NAACP, I might add, and many other prominent people--the people on this very committee were supporting certain candidates for re-election to office in spite of that.\nSo we'll let the chips fall where they may. But let me just add one more point.\nI might just say, Senator Durbin, your quote on the Ronnie White matter, when you were questioning Senator Ashcroft a few moments ago, quote, \"It appears that your conclusion about Justice White is a conclusion that is not shared by the law enforcement community of the state of Missouri.\" I don't know where that came from, but we have a letter from the National Sheriffs Association, the Missouri Association of Police Chiefs, the Missouri Sheriffs Association all stating their opposition to Judge White.\nAnd I might--I just want--and then Senator Ashcroft, if you would like to respond or make a comment feel free to do it. I want everybody to understand--and I think Senator Ashcroft understands this. I heard all this stuff about how Senator Ashcroft led the fight to deny Ronnie White. He never spoke to me about it personally. Never asked me to do anything other than what my own conscience would dictate. So, I guess, I'm puzzled by all of this information that seems to be coming to light.\nBut let me just refer quickly to the letter from one of the victims, who is also a sheriff. And you know, the issue here--and I'm doing this only to get us back to focus, as to what this is about. Judge White had every right to make the decision he did as a judge, every right to do it. But there are consequences for that. The consequences are you could be perceived as being against tough law and order. And that's the way 54 United States senators saw it. That's not about race, and to imply that it is, is outrageous.\nLet me tell you what it is about. This is from Kenny Jones, whose wife was murdered. \"I'm writing to you about Judge White\"--I'm not going to read it all, I'll enter it as part of the record--\"... of the Missouri Supreme Court who's been nominated to be a federal judge. As law enforcement officers, we need judges who will back us up and not go looking for outrageous technicalities so a criminal can get off. We don't need a judge like White on the federal court bench.\n\"In addition to being sheriff of Moniteau County, I'm a victim of violent crime, so are my children. In December, 1991 James Johnson murdered my wife, Pam, the mother of my children. He shot Pam by ambush, firing through the window of our home during a church function that she was hosting. Johnson also killed Sheriff Charles Smith of Cooper County, Deputy Les Rourke (ph) of Moniteau County and Deputy Sandra Wilson of Miller County. He was convicted and sentenced to death.\n\"When the case was appealed and reached the Missouri Supreme Court, Judge White voted to overturn the death sentence of this man who murdered my wife and three good law officers. He was the only judge to vote this way.\n\"Please read Judge White's opinion. It is a slap in the face to the crime victims and law enforcement officers. If he cared about protecting crime victims and enforcing the law, he wouldn't have voted to let Johnson off death row.\n\"The Johnson case isn't the only anti-death penalty ruling by White. He has voted against capital punishment more than any other judge on the court. And I believe there is a pattern here.\" And he goes on to say, \"Please write to our senators, Bond and Ashcroft, et cetera.\"\nThe point being there's nothing here about racism or segregation, nothing. And to imply otherwise is really, in my view, less than what this Senate should be about, to say it mildly. This is the law enforcement people of the state of Missouri, as well as a victim who was a law enforcement person.\nAnd as I said, I respect Judge White for making that decision. He has every right to make that decision. But so do we, as people here in the Senate in confirming or not confirming a person to go on the federal bench, we have a right to use that information and to look at that information and make a decision as to whether or not that person should be on the bench.\nSo I think I'm going to stop here, Senator Ashcroft. You've had enough questions, I'm sure, to last you a long time. But just to say again, that it would be, in my view, one of the most egregious acts ever committed by this Senate should you be filibustered or not be confirmed.\nA man of your qualifications and decency, it would be--I just can't imagine that it would even be thought of in this body to do such a thing. If there's anybody that's more qualified, or ever has been more qualified, I don't know who that person is.\nI understand that Senator Hatch--is Senator Hatch here? I thought Senator Hatch wanted some of my time. I'd be happy to yield it to him or any other senator on my side who would like--Senator Specter would you like the remainder of time?\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: Yes?\nSPECTER: Since the senator has mentioned my name, I would like to just briefly ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter dated October 21, 1999, from the 4,500 members of the Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police, in which they say, quote, \"The record of Justice White is one of a jurist who's record on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the rights of victims and the rights of criminals.\"\nSMITH: Well, I have a letter here from the Fraternal Order of Police, Grand Lodge, who support Senator Ashcroft. Letter to Senator Leahy dated 10 January, supporting Senator Ashcroft to be the attorney general of the United States.\nLEAHY: Both letters will be included and part of the record.\nSMITH: Mr. Chairman, I also have some other documents. The letters from the Sheriffs Association and, as well as the Supreme Court of Missouri Johnson case, that I'd like also to enter into the record.\nLEAHY: It will be so included.\nSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI yield my remaining time to Senator Specter.\nLEAHY: How much time remains for Senator Smith?\nSMITH: Four minutes and 30 seconds.\nSPECTER: With a little extra time, Senator Ashcroft, I'd be glad to oblige.\nI turn to an issue which has been a major one during the administration of the current attorney general. That is the issue of an independent counsel on a statute which has lapsed. And now the Department of Justice has a structure through regulation, a classification called special counsel.\nThe critical art of that law has been the difficulty--the independent counsel law--the critical part has been to have any review of the judgment of the attorney general of the United States in declining to appoint independent counsel.\nIt is possible to structure a legislative review for a special prosecutor. But would I would like to explore with you, at this time, would be first, what are your general views as to the desirability of having an Office of Independent Counsel?\nASHCROFT: I'm happy to respond to that, and thank you.\nSince there is so much talk about race in the White case in the last minute, may I just take a few seconds, first, to say that I don't intend my actions or statements to be offensive. And to the extent they are, I'm very ready to say to people that I don't want that to be the case, and that I deplore racism and I always will.\nAnd I say to people who want to look at the confirmation record, that I, for 26 out of 27 black judicial nominees, I voted for them.\nAnd in the Foreign Relations Committee, where it was my responsibility to shepherd the appointment of diplomats to our posts around the world, I'm sure, given my assignment, that I saw more people confirmed as minorities to those posts than any other person in that interval during my service.\nI just want it clear that I reject racism, and that I do not intend my actions or statements to offend individuals, and I sincerely will avoid that in every potential opportunity.\nLet me address the special counsel item which you have raised.\nSPECTER: Senator Ashcroft, with only about two minutes left, let me zero-in on a point of particular interest to me, and I will come back to the generalized question when I have another round.\nThe difficulty has been in having any review of the attorney general's judgment. And we have had a substantial number of hearings, as you are well aware, in the Judiciary Committee, challenging the judgment of the attorney general on declining to appoint independent counsel in a number of specific cases where there was a generalized view that there was more than enough basis to do so.\nSpecial counsel is the category now, as I've said, for the attorney general to appoint outside counsel if a conflict arises. It is my thinking that to have an effective independent counsel statute or a category of special prosecutor, that there has to be a mechanism for reviewing the judgment of the attorney general. And what I would like to see structured, either by regulation within the department, as the department now has a regulation for special counsel, or a statute which would provide that a majority of the majority of the Judiciary Committee or a majority of the minority--and I take that standard from the old independent counsel statute--could go to the United States District Court and ask for a review on a standard of abuse of discretion, where there is precedent for the court to intervene and overturn the exercise of discretion of a prosecuting attorney. And there are some district court cases on that point.\nWhat would your thinking be on such a procedure to review the attorney general's discretion?\nASHCROFT: I have lamented, as a member of this committee, the unwillingness of the attorney general to act in some cases.\nAnd I'm not sure what the remedy is, but one of my ambitions and one of my aspirations, I should say, if I have the honor of being confirmed in this responsibility, is to increase our participation and our communication and our cooperation.\nI would be pleased to consider with you this kind of proposal. But this is a delicate arena of the line between the executive and the judicial. And the right oversight is, obviously, a very important--pardon me, executive and legislative--and the right oversight by legislative officials is very important.\nSo I would be happy to confer with you and to examine these potentials with you. I know that, as a career prosecutor--but once prosecuting and organizing an office of 300, probably, prosecutors in Philadelphia, one of the most notable U.S. attorney's office in America, that you know the need for the right kind of information flow to the person and direction of the office, and, if everything were public, how chilling it could be. So that there are delicate balances here, and I would be pleased to confer with you about these.\nSPECTER: Well, let me explore it with you when my next round comes.\nLEAHY: I've tried to give the senator from Pennsylvania extra time. He has gone a couple minutes over, and the senator from Washington state has been waiting patiently. And I'd note that the senator from Washington state--for the newest members of the committee--is also in attendance, on behalf of the Senate, at the same funeral. Senator Cantwell, yesterday, did not get her formal opening statements. And if she wants to take that time in addition to her 15 minutes...\nCANTWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that, and I will defer my opening statement was submitted yesterday and go right to questions if I can.\nSenator Ashcroft, you and I have not met before this morning. I've not had the opportunity, the same as my colleagues, in working with you in the past, so I looked forward to this question and answer session to, if I can, get some specifics on some policy areas in your record as well as the process by which you intend to uphold the law in these key areas.\nAnd I will try to be brief in my comments. If you could be brief in your answers, maybe we could get through a couple of these key issues. Otherwise, I'll come back to you.\nBut, first I'd like to go to the environment, because, obviously, to be sure the attorney general plays a significant role in protecting the environment. The Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice has been called the nation's environmental lawyer. In fact, the 700 employees, you could say, is the largest environmental law firm in the country.\nThe division is charged with several tasks, obviously relating to protecting the environment. The division ensures environmental laws on the books--whether that's the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act--and vigorously enforces--on behalf of its primary client agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, it also defends the United States against suits and challenges to federal laws. And also the division criminally prosecutes the worst offenders of the environment.\nSo there can be no doubt that the Department of Justice, through this division, has a crucial role in maintaining a clean environment for future generations.\nUnfortunately, Senator Ashcroft, I am troubled with your environmental record, particularly in attempts to weaken enforcement tools that EPA has, but as been said at this hearing numerous times, the job of attorney general is different. Now you will be charged with vigorously enforcing the very environmental laws are some of which you may have disagreed with. And obviously we've covered this, but I--it's a very important issue that I'd like to cover.\nAnd that is, how do you proceed given that clearly the Environmental and Natural Resources Division exercises this vital role? Will we continue to see an aggressive division that enforces the current law and goes after polluters? And will we continue to see a very aggressive and vigorous enforcement of the Superfund laws that ensures that environmental clean-up is done and completed?\nASHCROFT: Well, let me thank you very much for your questions and thank you for the opportunity to meet you this morning.\nI appreciate the clarity of your questions.\nI have had an opportunity to enforce environmental regulations before, in prior incarnations as a state attorney and governor. Whether it was fish kills or whether it was making sure that the way in which federal projects were operated and power generation facilities that threaten the wildlife and fish in my home state, I took action. It is an important division.\nI believe that we should do everything we can to fully enforce the environmental laws. That doesn't distinguish it from other divisions of the attorney general's office. It'll be my responsibility to fully enforce the laws in all of them. I have a commitment to the environment, personally, as well as a commitment to the environment that would come as a result of my oath of office.\nI happen to be a private environmentalist. Janet and I own a farm of 155 acres, which we have tried to maintain in ways that enhance the environment, with cultivating the right kind of trees so it qualifies as a tree farm, and sowing the right kind of grasses and weaving the right kind of borders between the river and the rest of the farm so that we do that. I say that just to let you know that I'm a person that believes that our responsibility is one of stewardship and that certainly would reinforce my willingness to obey the law and to enforce it.\nCANTWELL: I do have some concerns about your environmental record, but I'll leave that for a side and get to a specific question that I think may be very timely, and that is the Department of Agriculture's recently issued final roadless area conservation rule.\nCertainly, the implementation of the roadless initiative has been long and somewhat controversial. Already the rule is being challenged in the courts. As attorney general, will you aggressively defend and uphold this rule, which was implemented in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act? If I'm not mistaken, this is exactly the type of case that the Environmental Defense Section of the Environmental and Natural Resources Section of DOJ is charged with defending.\nASHCROFT: Very frankly, I'm not familiar with this rule. And I would have to examine it carefully and make a decision based on the outcome of my consultation with members of the department and others in the process.\nCANTWELL: It is a very timely issue, and I would like further information on that, as it relates to the particulars of a rule that has now been put in place and, obviously, is being challenged in the courts.\nASHCROFT: I'll be happy to work to provide you with additional information on that.\nCANTWELL: Thank you.\nMy second line of questioning is in regards to family planning. We have learned, during the time that you were in the Senate, you have advocated what some would describe as an extreme position in regards to reproductive choice and contraception. For example, you were a supporter of the human life amendment to the Constitution that would have declared life begins at conception, not fertilization. Many believe that such a binding legal precedent would outlaw common contraception, such as the pill.\nAnd, as I've stated before, you are entitled, obviously, in your previous position as senator, to your opinions. That said, the nominee of the Office of the U.S. Attorney General, let me ask you, specifically about contraception. Are your personal views opposed to family planning?\nASHCROFT: I think individuals who want to plan their families have every right to do so.\nCANTWELL: In the use of contraception?\nASHCROFT: I think individuals who want to use contraceptives have every right to do so.\nCANTWELL: So in regards...\nASHCROFT: I think that right is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\nCANTWELL: So about the laws that create legal rights to contraceptive coverage, for example, the EEOC recently issued a decision stating that employers who fail to include contraceptive coverage in employee health benefit plans, engage in sexual discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.\nNotwithstanding your personal opinion, will you defend the challenges to this law or initiate actions against employers who fail to provide such coverage?\nASHCROFT: I have not examined the law on the requirement that a private employer provide coverage in this respect. And I'm, at this time, not prepared to comment or to provide advice about the course of action I would take there.\nCANTWELL: And is that something that you wouldn't comment further on before your vote on nomination, or just this afternoon?\nASHCROFT: Well, I would defend the rule. You know, it's the job of the attorney general to defend the rule, but in terms of my own comments about how I feel about it, I haven't weighed the legal--I thought you were asking me for advice on it, and maybe I misconstrued your question.\nCANTWELL: Yes, would you defend challenges to the law or initiate action against employers who did discriminate against...\nASHCROFT: I would defend challenges to the law and seek to uphold the law.\nCANTWELL: Including actions against employers who failed to provide such coverage?\nASHCROFT: I'm not sure I have the enforcement authority of that rule in the Justice Department, were I to be confirmed. And so I'd be reluctant to say that I would deploy the resources of the Department of Justice to enforce the rule, if the enforcement is, by statute, focused in another agency.\nCANTWELL: Thank you.\nI'd like to cover one last issue, if I could, and it follows a line of thinking similar to some of the questions asked earlier today about judicial appointments. And I guess I'm trying to, if you will, understand the Ashcroft standard on your process of judicial appointments.\nThere is one judicial appointment that I'm familiar with, Margaret McCuen (ph), a federal judge from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. And I won't go through her various accomplishments, but she was supported by both Senator Gorton and Senator Murray, and in the end, after a two-year delay, she was confirmed by a 80-to-11 vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. So in that particular case, your opposition to Margaret McCuen (ph)--I'm just trying to understand, again, the Ashcroft standard in looking at the decision in opposition to that appointment.\nASHCROFT: Frankly, I don't remember the case. There were 230 different votes on judges. I do know that 218 times I voted for confirmation, but I don't remember the circumstance.\nCANTWELL: Well, I would ask if--this is a very important appointment as it relates to the Northwest, and I guess my concern is in a speech that you gave--and not to catch you off of comments, because we all give speeches--this was given in March of '97, in which you characterized Margaret McCuen (ph) as \"taking marching orders from the ACLU\" and characterized her efforts as \"sinister,\" in, I thought, a very harsh tone against a nominee that you and 10 other senators voted against.\nAnd so if you could get me information about your opposition to her. And I'd be happy to provide the copy of these remarks that were a part of the Heritage Lectures.\nBut in trying to understand the framework of us moving forward on your nomination, I'm trying to understand the framework of which you applied to other appointees and reflection upon that as you put your own team together in the various divisions underneath you.\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator.\nLet me just add this, that the standard for judicial nominations and lifetime positions are integrity, a commitment to rule of law, no issue litmus tests.\nPresident-elect Bush has said he wants judges who will interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.\nI'll be happy to provide you additional information about the particular inquiry you made, and thank you for it.\nCANTWELL: Well, I think my question relates to the fact that she was held up for two years, and your comments on record have been harsh, so I'd like to know your criteria and standards. So, I appreciate you getting back to me on that.\nASHCROFT: Thank you.\nCANTWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nThe senator from Kansas will be recognized next.\nWe've been having--for those who watch this on television, they'll see the little red and green lights that have been going on. Somehow that seems to have broken down the last few minutes. I'm having the staff notify me when there is two minutes left in the senator's time, and I will just make that announcement as unobtrusively as possible, both for Senator Brownback's case but also for Senator Ashcroft's case.\nSenator Brownback?\nBROWNBACK: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd thank you, John, for hanging in here. It's, I'm sure, been a long day and you'd rather have been at the dentist all day than here through the difficulties.\nI note some of the discussion back and forth with some, I don't know, some amusement at points. The questions on the magazine interview that you did, which I thought was interesting from the standpoint a lot of people do interviews in magazines. I noted that Al Gore gave interviews to Playboy and Rolling Stone magazine, and some of the advertisements in the back of the magazines were for drugs, certain sexual items, paraphernalia or such that I do not care really to repeat them right here. But I think it would be fair to assume that Vice President Gore did not endorse those advertisements.\nASHCROFT: Nor do I.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBROWNBACK: Very good.\nASHCROFT: I'll get that out as quickly as I can now.\nBROWNBACK: If you could--and that's not to make light of the line of questioning, but it's to say that there are a lot of publications out there and none of us endorse these horrible lines that some were put in those, ideas of racism is just deplorable.\nBut there are a lot of magazines that put a lot of things out there, and just because a person grants an interview doesn't at all mean that they agree or condone it.\nASHCROFT: Well, let me see if I can clarify this. If the magazine has done the things that people on the committee have said to me that it does, I repudiate the magazine. I don't want to be a part of a magazine--I don't even want to do an interview with a magazine that in any way promotes slavery. I don't. That's not my--I had no understanding that that was the case about the magazine. I don't know if that is the case, but if it is, I repudiate it.\nSlavery is abhorrent. It's a stain on the fabric of America's history and life, and it's one we've had a hard time scrubbing out. And we never will, and perhaps we shouldn't scrub out our memory of it, because it should warn us against the kinds of things that people can do to each other.\nBROWNBACK: Thank you.\nI want to go down the line and question on a couple things on law enforcement.\nAnd I noted, Mr. Chairman, on the panels assembled for the hearings, nobody's been invited--not a single member of the law enforcement community on these panels, and I find that to be an unfortunate omission, since we're here to review the qualifications of the nation's chief law enforcement officer, the attorney general of the United States.\nSo, with the chairman's permission, I'd like to read and submit for the record a letter I received yesterday from the National Sheriffs Association, endorsing John Ashcroft.\nIt says: \"On behalf of the National Sheriffs Association, I'm writing to offer our strong support for the nomination of Attorney General-designate John Ashcroft. As a voice of elected law enforcement, we are proud to lend our support to his nomination and look forward to his confirmation by the Senate.\n\"As you know, NSA is a non-profit, professional association located in Alexandria, Virginia, representing nearly 3,100 elected sheriffs across the nation, and has more than 20,000 members, including deputy sheriffs, other law enforcement professionals, students and others.\n\"NSA has been a long-time supporter of John Ashcroft. In 1996, he received our prestigious President's Award. After reviewing Senator Ashcroft's record of service as it relates to law enforcement, we have determined that he will make an outstanding attorney general and he is eminently qualified to lead the Department of Justice.\n\"NSA feels that Senator Ashcroft will be an outstanding attorney general for enforcement and the U.S. Senate should confirm him.\" And then signed by the president of the organization. I ask that that be submitted into the record.\nMr. Chairman, also along...\nLEAHY: That, and the other letters from law enforcement agencies have been sent here, will all be--if they have not already been included in the record--of course, will be.\nBROWNBACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI also note along those same lines, I'd like to point out that Senator Ashcroft has been designed by President-elect Bush to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer has also been endorsed by the Law Enforcement Alliance of America. Well, I won't read their entire endorsement letter; I'd like to submit it in its entirety for the records. And would note at the outset, that this is the largest coalition of law enforcement, crime victims and concerned citizens in the country. They state in here, quote, \"They are firmly and vociferously working to ensure that former Missouri senator, John Ashcroft is confirmed as the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer.\" That's a pretty good endorsement.\nThe LEAA has endorsed President-elect George W. Bush's choice to head up the Justice Department, quote, \"because of his proven, tough-on-crime record, not only in the United States Senate, but also as Missouri's former governor and attorney general. John Ashcroft has consistently demonstrated his profound respect for the sanctity of the law. Because the law-and-order issue is fundamental to the demands of an attorney general, Senator Ashcroft exemplifies the kind of individual who can be trusted to uphold the law. There is no doubt that John Ashcroft will be guardian of liberty and equal justice.\" And I ask that that be submitted into the record, as well.\nThen from the Kansas attorney general, Carla Stovall. Carla Stovall sent me a letter urging my support for John Ashcroft to the esteemed position of United States attorney general. While Carla Stovall and I don't agree on all the issues, we have a great deal of respect for each other and she sent this letter in support of John Ashcroft.\n\"I'm writing to urge you to support John Ashcroft for the esteemed position of United States attorney general. Senator Ashcroft, as you know, at one time in his career held the position of Missouri attorney general and served as the president of the National Association of Attorneys General.\n\"I am hopeful he will be responsive to the interest and needs of the states as we deal with the Department of Justice on many issues of mutual concerns. While I have numerous philosophical differences for the position I've read that Senator Ashcroft has taken over the years, I do believe President-elect Bush should be afforded the right to have the men and women he has selected for key posts be confirmed by the United States Senate. I hope his intentions are so honored by your colleagues.\" I submit that into the record, as well.\nNow, on an issue that I think is a major, current one facing the country that will be in the hands of the attorney general, coming up, is an issue of drugs and particular methamphetamines. And I want to direct your attention and I have a couple of questions along that lines.\nI think we have to do everything we can to combat this scourge on the nation. And at the risk of being repetitive, I've received, again, another letter yesterday. This one from the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, describing what's taking place in my state in this problem with methamphetamines. And I think we, unfortunately, are typical of many other places across the country of this scourge of methamphetamines.\nHe states this in his annual report of what's going on in the state of Kansas regarding drugs. He said, \"In a word, the bad news is methamphetamine. In law enforcement we seldom have the luxury of selecting our targets of preference, our goals and objectives. We are compelled to face what is in front of us at the time. We must confront the most serious threats challenging the safety and security of our citizens.\n\"In Kansas, the past several years and the present time and in the foreseeable future, what is in front of us is methamphetamines and local meth labs. Kansas law enforcement seized approximately 700 meth labs last year. The final count is not yet tabulated, but obviously another record.\n\"At any rate, narcotics in general and methamphetamines in particular remain our agency's top investigative and forensics priorities. We have no other choice. Such is the demand for our services and on our resources from municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies and Kansas prosecutors.\"\nTo put them in perspective--and then I would like to ask you your views on what we need to do about methamphetamines--our laboratories, in 1994, received 5,513 drug case submissions. Last year, there were just under 9,000 new drug cases. Meth lab seizures since 1994 have increased almost 15,000 percent. We continue to receive an average of 33 new drug cases in our laboratory every business day.\nLEAHY: I'd just notify--the light is back on, and it is at three minutes.\nBROWNBACK: Thank you.\nI would appreciate your comments about what we should do about meth labs and methamphetamines and its scourge in this country, John.\nASHCROFT: Well, as you well know, Missouri has had the unfortunate distinction of being one of the two meth capitals in America. The state of California and the state of Missouri have led the nation in meth labs. And it's certainly a sad thing.\nAnd I know that local law enforcement authorities have needed the assistance of HIDTAs--High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area federal assistance programs--to help us, and have also needed the assistance of the DEA, a part of the Justice Department, in dealing with the contamination that's left behind when these meth labs are either abandoned or broken down by law enforcement officials. The residue of methamphetamine production, which all can be made from stuff you buy at a variety store, is toxic and it's dangerous.\nAnd I think the role that we must take is comprehensive. And I was pleased--I've mentioned on several occasions the privilege I had of working with Senator Feinstein of California--not only to have the right penalty structure so this drug, which is characteristic of rural America in many cases, has the same seriousness attached to it that some of the urban drugs, like cocaine, do. And I think that it's not only fair but necessary for us to fight against the drug. But secondly, that we have the ability to clean up and help, especially the small--in my area, a rural area, the sherrif's department doesn't have toxic clean-up capacity. So we need cooperation there.\nBut methamphetamine has been disastrous to the lives of individuals. And we need to explore treatment and be emphasizing education. That's why in the last measure, which was signed into law just less than six months ago, we had a component for assisting law enforcement, assisting in law enforcement training, assisting in clean-up, assisting in education and assisting in treatment.\nAnd I think this kind of problem only remediates when we have good cooperation between the local law enforcement officials and people at the national level. And it would be my ambition and my aspiration, if I have the privilege of being confirmed to this office, that we would keep those relationships, some of which you recited earlier, at the very highest level so that we can work together.\nMethamphetamines are just one of a series of drug problems that could very well steal a substantial portion of the future of America from us. Our young people are only 25 percent of the population; they're 100 percent of our future.\nBROWNBACK: I appreciate your work on that. And I also appreciate your common sense approach on the protection of the weakest, most vulnerable amongst us in this society no matter what their stage in life. I think that speaks volumes about a society if we're willing to protect those who are the weakest. And thank you for doing that.\nLEAHY: We have gone through the first round of questions. And we will now take a break for 10 minutes to allow the witness and others to stretch their legs. And we'll come back at the end of that time.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: I'll give a moment or two for everybody to get a chance to come on in.\nAnd so that we'll understand what we're doing, we're going to go to five-minute rounds now, and I'd really urge members to try to keep it as close to that time as possible for--we'll do it the usual fashion.\nI understand, Senator Hatch, everybody on your side has had their initial, is that correct?\nHATCH: That's right. Everybody has here.\nLEAHY: Everybody has here, and I know a number of senators have had other confirmation hearings and have been balancing their time.\nLet me begin. In October of '97, President Clinton nominated James Hormel to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg. He was an eminently qualified nominee. He had a distinguished career as a lawyer, a businessman, an educator, a philanthropist. He had diplomatic experience as the alternate U.S. representative to the UN General Assembly.\nLuxembourg's ambassador to the U.S.--because what we always do with an ambassador is we check first with the country that he'd be sent to see if he'd be acceptable. They said the people of their country would welcome him. A clear majority of senators were on record as saying they would vote for his confirmation.\nThat vote never occurred, because it was blocked. In the Foreign Relations Committee, only two senators voted against him, Senator Ashcroft and Senator Helms. I'm told, Senator Ashcroft, you did it without attending the hearing or submitting questions or statements for the record.\nYou did say at the luncheon with reporters that, quote, \"People who are nominated to represent this country have to be evaluated for whether they represent the country well and fairly. His conduct and the way in which he would represent the United States is probably not up to the standard that I would expect.\"\nIt would appear that you're referring to his sexual orientation, although this is a man that, while you placed a hold on his nomination, all but one other member, Republican and Democrat, in the Foreign Relations Committee voted for him. Former Secretary of State, in President Reagan's administration, George Schultz strongly supported him.\nAfter you voted against his nomination in committee, James Hormel wrote a letter.\nHe asked to meet with you regarding his qualifications. He followed up with a number of phone calls to your office. You did not return the phone calls. Your staff did not. You refused to meet him, which is similar to a complaint made by Congressman Conyers, who shared concerns about your nomination.\nNow, I know it is traditional for senators to extend the president's nominees the courtesy of a meeting. I don't think I've ever declined a meeting with any nominee of any president when they've asked to. I know of no senator who has refused to meet with you when you've asked.\nSo, I'm asking you this: Did you block his nomination from coming to a vote because he is gay?\nASHCROFT: I did not. And I will enforce the law equally without regard to sexual orientation if appointed and confirmed as attorney general. Let me just address these issues a little bit since they've been raised.\nLEAHY: Why did you refuse--why did you vote against him? And why were you involved in an effort to block his nomination from ever coming to a vote?\nASHCROFT: Well, frankly, I had known Mr. Hormel for a long time. He had recruited me, when I was a student in college, to go to the University of Chicago Law School.\nLEAHY: He was your dean, was he not?\nASHCROFT: At the University of Chicago, he was an assistant dean at the law school who, I believe, had focused his efforts on admissions process and things like that. The dean of the law school, if I'm not mistaken, was a fellow named Phil Neal (ph).\nBut I did know him. I made a judgment that it would be ill-advised to make him ambassador based on the totality of the record. I did not believe that he would effectively represent the United States in that particular post.\nBut I want to make very clear: Sexual orientation has never been something that I've used in hiring in any of the jobs, in any of the offices I've held. It will not be a consideration in hiring at the Department of Justice. It hasn't been for me. Even if the executive order would be repealed, I would still not consider sexual orientation in hiring at the Department of Justice because I don't believe it relevant to the responsibilities.\nLEAHY: To what extent, though, the--I'm not talking about hiring at the department, I'm talking about this one case, James Hormel. If he had not been gay, would you have at least talked to him before you voted against him? Would you have at least gone to the hearing? Would you have at least submitted a question?\nASHCROFT: I'm not prepared to redebate that nomination here, today. I am prepared to say that I knew him. I made a judgment that it would be ill-advised to make him ambassador. And as a senator, I made the decision that, based on the totality of his record, that I didn't think he would effectively represent the United States.\nLEAHY: And it was your conclusion that all the other senators on the Foreign Relations Committee, with the exception of Senator Helms, were wrong; you were right. That George Schultz, who had been the secretary of state under President Reagan was wrong, and you were right. And the people of Luxembourg, who had the full record on Mr. Hormel were wrong, and you were right. And you did that without either meeting with them, going to the hearing asking a single question, or even answering his letter.\nASHCROFT: No, I did not conclude that I was right and they were wrong, I exercised the responsibility I had as a senator to make a judgment. I made that judgment. I expected other senators to reach judgments on their own. They have a responsibility to do that. I have a responsibility to do what I did. And based on the totality of the record and my understanding, I made that judgment. I did not pass judgment on to other senators or upon those who endorsed his nomination.\nLEAHY: But part of that judgment was to help make sure that these other senators never got a chance to vote on Mr. Hormel on the floor. So, basically, you substituted your judgment for what appears--at least by those who stated their willingness to vote for him, you substituted your judgment for a majority of the United States Senate.\nASHCROFT: I don't believe I put a hold on Mr. Hormel's nomination.\nLEAHY: Never?\nASHCROFT: I don't believe I put a hold on Mr. Hormel's nomination.\nLEAHY: If you find otherwise, feel free to correct the record on that.\nSenator Hatch?\nHATCH: As one who openly supported Mr. Hormel, because of his experience, you made the decision, based upon your knowledge, the totality of the evidence, and as a senator, you had a right to do so, is that right?\nASHCROFT: That's correct.\nHATCH: I mean, we can disagree around once in a while around here. Or do we just have to play the political correctness game right on down the line?\nASHCROFT: Well, I made a judgment based on the totality of the record, on one...\nHATCH: I accept that.\nNow, Senator Ashcroft, isn't it true that, while it's been suggested that as attorney general you essentially mounted too vigorous a defense of your client in the state of Missouri in the St. Louis school litigation, you were the one insisting to state officials that the court orders be followed? Indeed, didn't the Democratic state treasurer get so frustrated with your insistence that orders to pay for students' transportation be complied with that he told the press he was planning to hire outside counsel to mount a more vigorous challenge to these orders; is that correct?\nASHCROFT: That's my recollection.\nHATCH: All right. In other words, while some have criticized you for defending your state in these matters, others, including the Democratic state treasurer, were criticizing you for not litigating them hard enough; is that right?\nASHCROFT: That's correct.\nHATCH: Well, so, in fact, you're being criticized for defending the state while the Democratic state treasurer was resisting complying with the court orders which you were insisting he had to comply with. Now, I sense, maybe, a little serious hypocrisy here. Isn't what you were doing simply following the law and discharging your duties in defense of your state as a state attorney general?\nASHCROFT: I believe that I was faithfully discharging my duties and protecting the interests of the state and the children in the state. When the state treasurer balked at writing the checks, it became necessary to send a special delegation from my office to him to indicate to him that we believed compliance with the law was the inescapable responsibility; that we had the duty and the responsibility to resist in the courts where we felt like there was injustice, but upon the conclusion of the matter by the courts, our duty, we felt, was to pay the bill.\nAnd I still believe that to be the case. And fortunately, the state treasurer at the time made the decision to abandon plans for a separate counsel and to go ahead and make the payments.\nHATCH: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to return to one point raised earlier today, where Senator Ashcroft was criticized for his defense of the state of Missouri in the school desegregation cases.\nWell, Jay Nixon, Senator Ashcroft's Democratic successor and the current attorney general, also opposed state funding for desegregation, at least that's my understanding. Is that true?\nASHCROFT: Yes, it is true.\nHATCH: Well, let me go further. Jay Nixon took many of the same positions as John Ashcroft, yet Senator Ashcroft's been attacked by some of our Democratic friends and Jay Nixon has been supported by Democratic friends. Indeed, many of them campaigned for them. Am I wrong in making those comments?\nASHCROFT: I think it's fair to say that he's been supported by Democrats. He's the Democrat attorney general of the state.\nHATCH: Oh, I don't blame him for that. I'm just saying that it just seems kind of a double standard to me.\nASHCROFT: Well, the standard that I repaired to was my--the need to represent the state and to defend its interests, but when a matter would be concluded, we complied with the orders of the federal district court and of the Eighth Circuit court of appeals and of the United States Supreme Court.\nHATCH: Senator Ashcroft, I think Senator Cantwell raised an important issue regarding enforcement of environmental laws, on which you have a solid and positive record.\nFor example, as Missouri attorney general, you aggressively enforced Missouri's environmental protection laws against polluters, including an action brought to prevent an electric company from causing oxygen levels in waters downstream from the power plant to fall, thereby harming fish, and to recover damages for fish kill.\nA successful action brought against the owner of an apartment complex for violations of the Missouri clean water law relating to treatment of waste water. And an action against an owner of a trailer park for violations of the Missouri clean water law relating to treatment of waste water.\nFurthermore, as Missouri attorney general, you filed numerous amicus briefs, friend-of-the-court briefs, supporting environmental protections. For example, in Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 1983 case, you filed a brief supporting a state of California law that conditioned the construction of nuclear power plants on findings by the state that adequate storage facilities and means of disposal are available.\nIn Sforhes (ph) v. Nebraska, a 1982 case, you endorse the state of Nebraska's effort to stop defendants from transporting Nebraska groundwater into Colorado without a permit.\nLet me just mention one more. In Baltimore Gas and Electric Company v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 1983, you filed a brief supporting the Natural Resources Defense Council's position on tougher environmental relations relating to the storage of nuclear waste.\nNow, this is impressive and, as U.S. attorney general, would you similarly enforce our country's environmental laws?\nASHCROFT: I will enforce the laws protecting the environment and do so to the best of my ability. It is a public trust and it is a special responsibility to the next generations.\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Senator, my time is up.\nLEAHY: Do you want more time?\nASHCROFT: No, that's fine.\nKENNEDY: Thank you very much. Of course, Jay Nixon, no matter how nice a fellow he may be, is not up for attorney general. That's the major difference. That's the big difference in this particular case.\nNow, Senator Ashcroft, yesterday and today you testified that you'll uphold your oath of office to defend the Constitution. Five times before you took that same oath. As attorney general and governor of Missouri, you said, \"I swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States and of the state of Missouri, and to faithfully demean myself in the office, so help me God.\"\nAnd yet, you fought the voluntary school desegregation in St. Louis. In fact, Judge Stephen Limbaugh, who was appointed by President Reagan, noted that, \"the state has resorted to factual inaccuracies, statistical distortions and insipid remarks regarding the courts handling of the case.\" Limbaugh continued to warn the state, \"to desist in filing further motions grounded in rumor, unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing.\" He added that, \"the state even resorted to veiled threats towards the court to thwart implementation of the previous order.\" That was his estimate on.\nWhen you became attorney general in 1976, Roe v. Wade, guaranteeing a woman's right to choose, had been the law of the land and needless to say, all during this period of time is after the Brown v. Board of Education. Now, when you became attorney general in '76, Roe v. Wade guaranteed a woman's right to choose had been the law of the land. For three years, during the period from '73 and '76, the Supreme Court had not altered it's original ruling, the decision was settled law.\nBut during the period between '76 and '92, the 16 years that you served as attorney general and governor of Missouri, you became one of the nation's most aggressive leaders of the strategy to dismantle or reverse that decision protecting a woman's right to choose.\nYou brought case after case in the lower federal courts. You pressed those cases all the way to the United States Supreme Court. You personally argued the planned parenthood case in the Supreme Court. You signed legislation into law to try to overturn Roe and to severely restrict a woman's right to choose. And at a 1991 dinner, you boasted that no state had more anti-abortion cases that reached the Supreme Court than Missouri.\nIsn't there a serious loophole in your view of your oath of office? You say you'll enforce the laws of the land as long as they are still on the books. But in the fundamental areas, like civil rights, womens' rights to choose, gun control, when you don't agree with the laws on the books, you've demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that you'll use all the powers of your office to undermine those laws to persuade the courts to overrule them. That's what you've done every time before--every time. So why will it be any different this time?\nASHCROFT: Let me just say to you that I have lived within the rulings of the court in every one of those settings. Roe v. Wade defined a setting, which said that abortions were not to be regulated--or not to be forbidden, but it left a very, very serious gap in the health care system regarding reproductive health services.\nIf you couldn't regulate abortions, could you have minimal standards for abortion clinics? Could you require that abortions would be conducted by physicians instead of back alleys? Could you require that there be certain conditions, like parental consent for minors who are going to have an abortion? Could you require that there be certain counseling, so that young women who are going to get an abortion, so that they could be assured that they were making a decision that was in their best interest and that they understood the health impacts? All of these questions were things that were left unanswered and unresolved by the case of Roe v. Wade.\nAnd virtually, every jurisdiction in the United States began to find ways to safeguard everything from maternal health to provide the right framework in which to exercise its responsibility as it related to this situation in reproductive health care.\nBut my point, though, Senator, is that you lived within the rule because you had to. That was the law. But you tried to change and alter and took great pride in it. And we've heard--based upon deep-seated beliefs, which I respect.\nBut that is the record. You took the oath of office all those times as attorney general and governor, and still were willing, in these areas...\nASHCROFT: Senator, let me respond. We're out of time on this, but I think implicit in what you're saying here is that a person swears to uphold the law, it means if he goes into government, he can't govern by way of changing the law. Every time--if you'll allow me to answer this question. I've been very patient in this respect, and I would just ask the Senate for the right for me to respond.\nLEAHY: The chair will give you whatever time you need. I've said that a dozen times during this hearing.\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that assurance as well, but I would like to have an uninterrupted time to explain my position here. And all the assurances of time will not allow me to make a statement, which I think I ought to be able to make here. And I think in fairness I would request that.\nNow, you've criticized me because I said that I would uphold the law and the Constitution of the United States, and then I did things to define the law by virtue of lawsuits. I did things to refine the law when I had an enactment rule, which is the job of a governor when he signs things into the law.\nI don't think it's subverting the Constitution for a governor to sign a change in the law. I don't think it's a breaking of his oath. I think all those things are done within the framework of the law and within the framework of the Constitution.\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding here today, and I'm sorry that I have this responsibility to clarify it, that when someone tests an order in court, that someone is defying the law. Frankly, I have always been raised to believe that the way you tested things was take them to court; that the judicial system was established for the purpose--for the purpose of resolving differences. That's why the Constitution sets it up.\nAnd so that, yes, when the state was offended by an order which we thought was illegal, our view was not to disrespect it, our view was not to disobey it. Our view was to litigate it, and then if it came out in our direction, we were winners; and if it came out against us, we abided by the law.\nYou raised the case that I argued in the Supreme Court. There were a handful of different provisions there. Some, the Supreme Court said, \"No, these don't pass muster.\" Some, the Supreme Court said, \"These pass muster.\"\nNow, I submit to you that to participate in the development of the law is not to violate your oath, as long as you participate in the development of the law in accordance with the opportunities expressed.\nNow, I defended the state of Missouri. I defended the state of Missouri aggressively. That's the job of the attorney general. Jay Nixon has done the same. All of the attorneys general--Jack Danforth did it before I did it, Jay Nixon did it after I did it. That's the job of an attorney general. And my job as attorney general would be for me to defend the law of the United States, and I'll do it--all of the laws. That's my job.\nNow, one of the laws which might pass is a law that might deal with partial birth abortion. Now, I don't know whether you would ask me, if the Congress comes up with a law that relates to that issue, to abandon my duty to defend that law. A majority of the members of the panel on this committee voted in favor of such a law in the last Congress, and I think if Janet Reno--pardon me--if Attorney General Reno had defended the law, she wouldn't have violated her oath of office.\nSo it's with--I just--I want to say that it's not uncommon for attorneys general to defend the interests of their states; that's what their job is. And it's not a violation of their oath of office or the Constitution of the United States to seek to make sure that what is done at the state level is consistent with the Constitution at the state level or consistent with the Constitution at the national level.\nAnd when we swear to uphold the oath of office, I think we are swearing to do things in an orderly and lawful manner. Jay Nixon has done that as the attorney general of Missouri. I don't criticize him.\nAnd I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I have gone too long.\nAnd I apologize. And I thank all of you for allowing me to respond.\nKENNEDY: Just to finish it--but I appreciate your response. My sense is, Senator, is that you are attempting to overturn the law on the Roe v. Wade. That is wasn't just testing it to find out its limits, it was to overturn it. That was the thrust.\nAnd in respond and the reason I raise this is, because earlier today you gave the assurances, in response to Senator Schumer, about how you would treat that case in the future. And the logical question came into my mind that if you challenged it in the passed, having taken the oath of office, wasn't there a good likelihood that you would challenge it in the future, after taking it? That's the...\nASHCROFT: Well, I think that's a very good question. I'm very pleased to have a chance to answer that.\nWhen the state legislature of Missouri passed the law that might have needed to be evaluated in that context, I advanced that law. It was my job. I advanced that in the courts to defend it.\nBut my job as attorney general of the United States will be to defend the law and Constitution of the United States as it's been articulated. And I think for me to have abandoned by responsibility as the attorney general of the state, would have been to set myself outside the system at that time, just as much as it would be for me to set myself outside the system if I were to break my word and not defend the law that I would be sworn to uphold and defend it if I am honored with the confirmation by the United States Senate.\nLEAHY: I would note that the chair, at the request of the nominee, extended--more than doubled the time so that he could have an interrupted answer, and he had it. I would hope that we might follow the example--I'm always of a hopeful nature--that we could follow the example of Senator Hatch and myself, who stayed within seconds of our time.\nI turn to the distinguished soon to be president pro tem, Senator Thurmond.\nTHURMOND: Senator Ashcroft, I want to congratulate on the tremendous support and endorsements you have received. For example, I noticed that you were endorsed by the National Association of Korean-Americans.\nAlso the largest grassroots Jewish group in America, has urged the committee, in a letter to Senator Hatch, to confirm you. They wrote, and I quote, \"We know John Ashcroft to be a man of honesty and integrity, not only in regard to his personal and professional duties, but also in a broader, more profound sense.\"\nWhat stronger endorsement can anyone get than that? I think that's special. I think you're honest, I think you're capable, and I think you're courageous. And I expect to vote for you.\nThank you.\nASHCROFT: Thank you, sir. I'm very pleased.\nLEAHY: Senator Kohl?\nKOHL: Thank you very much.\nSenator Ashcroft, the recent revelations about Firestone tires and tread separation have generated tremendous concern throughout the country about tire safety. I'm sure you share in the distress about the defective tires and the efficiency of the recall.\nI wonder whether you share my concern that evidence of the defective tires was kept hidden for far too long through legal settlements that gagged the disclosure of the information vital to the safety of the driving public.\nIn product defective cases like Firestone, corporate defendants often ask plaintiffs to accept secrecy agreements as part of a settlement. Sometimes these orders serve a legitimate purpose, for example, keeping a trade secret confidential. But all too often, these agreements simply hide vital information that could potentially affect the lives of many, many thousands of people and certainly general public health and safety.\nThe Sunshine in Litigation Act would compel judges to consider the impact on public health and safety before accepting secrecy orders. Since the Firestone cases, this legislation is necessary, I believe now more than ever.\nAt a hearing before this committee in 1995, I asked respected attorney Ted Olson about this bill. You probably know him as the man who argued the election case for President-elect Bush before the Supreme Court. Mr. Olson agreed with me, saying, and I quote, \"It is the public's business that is taking place before the courts. And there ought to be an awfully good reason before the courts are used as an instrument and the public cannot know what is going on.\"\nI ask you, do you agree with Mr. Olson on this issue? And as the nation's top litigator, would you sign off on a Justice Department settlement that concealed information vital to the health and safety of the American public?\nASHCROFT: I believe, if I understand Mr. Olson correctly, that I do agree with him.\nI think unnecessarily hiding or otherwise concealing from the public those kinds of things would be against the interests of the people. I think I would have to consider each case on its individual merits, but I think there's great danger in not providing public information.\nAs related to the Firestone tire case, I was active following that because I don't think we have a good enough clearinghouse for providing information about recalls. And I would hope that the United States could find a way to take a lead in providing--if nothing more than a clearinghouse so that we could know when problems have emerged with products anywhere in the world.\nKOHL: The recalls are one thing, but we're talking about judges who allow companies to sign settlements with people who sue that give them money in return for gagging the settlement, and as a result, defective products continue to be sold. Doesn't that strike you as being the wrong thing to do in the United States? And wouldn't you agree that judges should at least consider--which is all this litigation, this court...\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nKOHL: ... just consider the impact on public health and safety before they agree to a gag order?\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nKOHL: One more, child safety locks. You've consistently voted against gun safety proposals, including the moderate child safety lock amendment that Senator Hatch and I wrote. You argued that we need to enforce the current gun laws rather than pass new ones. The Senate and the House passed child safety lock provision overwhelmingly, and polls consistently show that about 80 percent of the American public agrees that we should sell all handguns along with a child safety lock.\nNow everyone agrees that we need to enforce the current laws as a part of comprehensive gun safety strategy. Unfortunately, no matter how many prosecutors we have, 10,000 children a year will still be involved in accidental shootings unless we make it virtually impossible or very difficult for children to fire the guns.\nAnd so I ask you, would you be willing to reconsider? Would you be willing to consider whether or not its legitimate, along with a handgun, to see to it that a child safety lock is sold?\nTo put it to you another way: What would you have against it?\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator Kohl. Let me try and answer this very quickly.\nI do support the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms for citizens. But as I indicated earlier, there are things that are within the range of that that can be done. And I don't think, for instance, child safety locks offend the Constitution of the United States.\nThe president-elect has expressed himself in favor of a program for providing child safety locks. I'd be very happy to advance that interest of his and to work with you in terms of improving our performance there.\nKOHL: Yes, but that falls just a little short--and then my last question because my time has run out--that falls somewhat short to see to it that every handgun that's sold has a child safety lock; whether it's free or whether they pay for it is another question. But I'm suggesting that it makes common sense, and I'm asking you your opinion.\nIt's common sense, along with a person who buys a handgun, should also have a child safety lock. There's no requirement that they have to use it. That's not written into this law.\nIf they don't want to use it, they don't use it. But shouldn't we, in the interest of our children, see to it that when a handgun is sold, a child safety lock accompanies that handgun?\nASHCROFT: It is my understanding that the president-elect of the United States would support legislation requiring child safety locks and then supporting the provision of child safety locks with that requirement. And I would be happy to participate with the president in achieving that objective.\nKOHL: I thank you.\nASHCROFT: Thank you.\nLEAHY: The senior senator from Pennsylvania.\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nPicking up on what Senator Kohl has said, the business about disclosing those agreements about product liability cases is very much, in my view, in the public interest. As I recollect it, we had a vote on an amendment offered by Senator Kohl which passed, and then the bill was taken down. And I would urge you to take a look at Senator Kohl's recommendation.\nASHCROFT: I would be happy to do so.\nSPECTER: When you take a look at Firestone and Ford and the kind of conduct that they engaged in, there was a reckless disregard for the safety of people who died; more than 100 people died. And legislation has now been enacted which provides for criminal penalties for failure to report those defects which will come squarely under the administration of a vigorous U.S. attorney general, which is something you ought to take a hard look at if confirmed.\nLet me move back to the question of independent counsel, which I only had a very brief time on time yielded by Senator Smith, and I'm not sure it can be handled even within a five-minute time interval. But I raised the issue of having review of what the attorney general does.\nNow, whether it is by statute, like the independent counsel statute, or whether it is by regulation, as a special prosecutor has been denominated by Department of Justice regulation, there is, it seems to me, an urgent need for at least congressional oversight when the attorney general makes a ruling which is so much at variance with the facts and what others have recommended.\nOn the issue of independent counsel, Charles LaBella recommended it, Bob Conrad recommended it, Bob Litt recommended it, FBI Director Louis Freeh recommended it. We came down in hearings and there were clear issues of law. For example, on a critical question as to whether hard or soft money was being raised, there was a memorandum in the file which referred to hard money as evidence, and the attorney general testified that she would not consider it because the witness didn't remember.\nBut that missed the legal distinction between prior recollection recorded, which is solid evidence, as opposed to present recollection refreshed.\nI see Senator Ashcroft nodding in the affirmative.\nNow, there simply has to be some remedy. And there is a lot of litigation which says that a taxpayer can't come into court and seek redress, but where you have the Judiciary Committee and the Judiciary Committee of both Houses has been singled out as a party withstanding under the old statute where a request could be made that the attorney general had to respond to, not for appeals, but had to respond to. And in order to give the minority standing, it said if there was a majority of the minority on either committee. And the same applied to the majority, a majority of the majority. Not every senator in either party had to agree to give standing.\nAnd it seems to me that you just don't have the rule of law if on something as critical as a conflict of interest. And there is no division of view as to whether you need some remedy; somebody outside the department, if a ranking official, without getting involved in defining who that should be, and you have the special prosecutor by regulation.\nNow, it is true, as you said, they are sensitive matters between the executive and judicial branches. And then you said, \"Well, executive and legislative branches.\" Conflicts all around. And there are constitutional issues.\nBut I would urge you to take a look at it. And I know you have a deep regard for congressional oversight. Now, you may have a little different view as attorney general, but as a senator, about the kind of oversight.\nBut I would like your response as to whether--and I'll ask you a leading question. Don't you think that the attorney general of the United States, on matters of that importance, ought to have a judgment reviewable by someone and initiated by an entity with standing, like the Judiciary Committee, and reviewable in court? What about it Senator Ashcroft?\nASHCROFT: Well, I, first of all, greatly respect your understanding of this issue. I don't know of anyone who's devoted more time and energy to it or thought to it. And you've done it from the prospective of a prosecutor, which I think is the basic role you would assign to the Justice Department in this setting.\nSPECTER: And a senator.\nASHCROFT: And a senator. So, you've understood both sides in ways that I haven't. I would be very pleased to confer with you and to work toward greater accountability. Now, for--in those settings.\nI would also say to you that I would hope that I would be able to work with this committee. I enjoyed this committee greatly when I had the privilege of working with it as a member. And as the first attorney general, if I am confirmed, to serve from this committee in a long time in that office, I would hope that we would work together in order to resolve these differences in a context that would also protect the, kind of, flow of information that has to exist in a prosecutorial operation.\nI offer myself fully to confer with you about that and to find a way to resolve these issues.\nSPECTER: Thank you.\nLEAHY: The senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, I believe Senator Leahy touched on this a few minutes ago, but I know that you have strongly held views on gays and homosexuality. You and I have had discussions about this, and in a 1998 appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" you said, \"I believe the Bible calls it a sin, and that's what defines sin for me.\"\nNow, following on Senator Leahy's question, one of the great successes of the civil rights struggle of the 1960s was the enactment of federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of race, national origin, religion or gender. And in 1996, Attorney General Reno implemented a policy at the Justice Department that prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of the employee's sexual orientation, as well as race, gender, religion and disability.\nIf confirmed as attorney general, would you continue and enforce this policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation?\nASHCROFT: As attorney general, I will not make sexual orientation a matter to be considered in hiring or firing, for that matter.\nFEINGOLD: So you will continue that policy?\nASHCROFT: Yes, I will. I, as state auditor of Missouri, did not, as attorney general of Missouri, did not. I did not as governor of Missouri, nor did I as a member of the Senate. I would continue the policy, executive order or not.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator.\nWill you permit DOJ Pride, a voluntary organization of gay, lesbian and bisexual DOJ employees, to continue to use Justice Department facilities on the same basis as other voluntary employee groups or other minority Justice Department employees?\nASHCROFT: It would be my intention not to discriminate against any group that appropriately constituted in the Department of Justice.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you.\nAttorney General Reno clarified that sexual orientation should not be a factor for FBI security clearances. As attorney general would you continue and enforce this policy?\nASHCROFT: I have not had a chance to review the basis for the FBI standard and I am not familiar with it. I would evaluate it based upon conferring with the officials in the bureau.\nFEINGOLD: Respect that and hope it will be--conclusion will be consistent with your earlier answers.\nLet me switch to a topic that's already been covered in part, the so-called Southern Partisan Article. I want to return to the question that Senator Biden asked about the interview you gave.\nI understand that you told Senator Biden that when you gave that interview you didn't know much about it, that it was a telephone interview, and you give lots of interviews. And I certainly understand that, as somebody that's given a lot of interviews. And Senator Brownback indicated that as well.\nThe fact that you did an interview with a magazine doesn't mean that you subscribe to its views. But if you didn't know much about the publication, how could you praise it in such glowing terms in the interview? I mean, how could you say, \"Your magazine always helps set the record straight\"?\nASHCROFT: Well, I was told that they were involved in a group that opposed revisionism. I had recently finished reading a book published by a fellow named Thomas West from the Claremont Institute about the founders of our country and the revisionist history. Individuals who set up the interview said, \"These folks are interested in history.\" It was presented to me as a history journal, and on that basis I made the remarks.\nFEINGOLD: Thank you.\nLet me switch to one other area. Yesterday, a number of people mentioned an attorney general opinion that said there was no basis in Missouri law to allow the distribution of religious literature in the public schools. And at one point you said something that struck me, and I want to make sure I understood it.\nI believe you said that the Missouri Constitution was more clear with regard to the principle of separation of church and state than the federal Constitution. Do you have any doubt that the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of our Constitution requires a separation between church and state?\nASHCROFT: No, I don't. But I would just say that for things that had been approved by the United States Supreme Court, like transportation to religious schools and all, had been approved under the federal Constitution, that was more explicitly defined out of the potential in the Missouri Constitution, so that the interpretation of the Missouri Constitution had been a more durable barrier in this setting.\nAnd I think I expressed that, because there are a number of things which have been ruled acceptable under the law of the United States of America that are not acceptable under the laws and constitution expressed in the...\nFEINGOLD: But you don't consider the First Amendment vague on the point of the separation of church and state.\nASHCROFT: No, I don't. And I think the courts have construed it. And my point was that as the courts have construed it, the courts have said things are OK in the federal setting that aren't OK in the Missouri setting, so I had to go beyond the federal law to go and read the law that I was charged to read in the setting of the state constitution.\nFEINGOLD: I thank you for that clarification. I think my time's up.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: The senator from Arizona.\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I'll just be very brief.\nI'll make this comment: It's difficult for us in this setting, I think, to really be able to evaluate things which we can't possibly anticipate. Some of my colleagues on the panel here have concerns that Senator Ashcroft, as attorney general, would try to change the law. Senator Kennedy referred to this a moment ago. And certainly, based upon his firm advocacy in the past, it's a reasonable sentiment to hold.\nSenator Ashcroft, on the other hand, is in the unfortunate position almost of having to prove a negative, to prove that, no, he won't do anything improper. Well, it's hard to prove that you're not going to do something improper in the future. He's basically said, \"Give me a chance and I'll show you.\"\nIt is also true that we're talking to some extent about shades of gray here. It is not the case that there is something called \"the law,\" and that's all there is to is, and everybody knows exactly what it is, and it's always clear to the attorney general exactly what to do as a result of that.\nThe attorney general will have to make decisions. And as Senator Ashcroft pointed out, when he was attorney general there were some questions at the periphery of the settled law. Well, we know what Roe v. Wade is, but can you require parental consent, for example. That's a new question, so it has to be litigated.\nAnd I think that those of us on the side of supporting Senator Ashcroft have to acknowledge that there will be those kinds of situations and that there will be areas for judgment.\nAnd I also think that some of our friends who have some skepticism about what Senator Ashcroft should do, should also then consider the fact that a lot of these policy issues will be informed by the position of the new president of the United States. I think we can all make our judgments about how aggressive he will be to move in certain areas. But I urge my colleagues to at least consider that element of the policy choices that the attorney general will make. And I also urge them to consider the integrity of the nominee and his strong commitment to keep his word.\nSo I guess what I would caution here is that both people who are skeptical of Senator Ashcroft and those who are his adherents here probably both overstate the case a little bit to make the political point. In many respects we can't know. And that then raises the question, what's the default position?\nAnd, Senator Ashcroft, I get back to something you said at the very close of your opening statement. You can't prove to us that you will satisfy every one of us. Some of my colleagues are pretty pleasantly surprised, I must confess, that you've been so willing to agree to enforce laws that you haven't always agreed with. And so the real question is, at the end of the day, what will persuade them that they can trust you? And I'd like to have you comment on that very briefly.\nIn my own case, what you said at the conclusion of your opening remarks is very persuasive and that is that you take your oath of office very, very seriously. And you've also noted, a couple of times, you're going to be very available to us in the future. And since you know us and we know you, I suspect you know how well you'll be treated if you went outside the bounds of some of the commitments that you've made.\nSo, I just wondered if you'd like to comment on that to try to add to the assurances that you've already given the members of this committee.\nASHCROFT: I thank the senator. I really believe my record is a record of operating to enforce the law as attorney.\nTHURMOND: Speak in the loudspeaker.\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator.\nLEAHY: Towards the machine.\nASHCROFT: I believe my record demonstrates my willingness to enforce the law, and that's why I was so eager to clarify my position when Senator Kennedy asked me about the school cases.\nThere is a difference, though, that I would site. And I think it's important that the state attorney general is an elected official who makes final decisions on policy on his own. When the governor of the state calls the state attorney general on policy issues, the state attorney general says, \"You know, you ran for the wrong office if you want to run this office on policy.\"\nIn the federal system, the attorney general is--the structure of the system designs to make the attorney general part of the administration, not an administrative or an executive office, part of the executive. And there's a delicate balance there. And I think the responsibility to respond to the executive is one that is important and it relates to policy not to law enforcement in the same way.\nLEAHY: The senior senator from New York.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd thank you for your cooperation, Senator Ashcroft; it's been a long day.\nFirst, I'd ask you two quick questions and please try to answer these yes or no. They are not complicated or intended as traps in any way. As you know, there is an ongoing Civil Rights Department investigation of Voting Rights Act violation that might have occurred in Florida. As attorney general, would you allow that investigation to continue?\nASHCROFT: I will investigate any alleged voting rights violation that has credible evidence. And I am not familiar with the evidence in the case, but that would be the standard I would apply. I have no reason not to go forward, and would not go forward for any reason other than a conclusion that there wasn't credible evidence to pursue the case.\nSCHUMER: The next one just also quickly, in just a little elaboration, you had mentioned that on the matter of sexual orientation you never discriminated in your various offices in terms of hiring. But you were one of a minority of senators who refused to sign a statement that you wouldn't discriminate when you were a senator. Can you explain the seeming disparity?\nASHCROFT: I've never discriminated. I don't have any recollection about this statement, and frankly, I'd have to answer, \"I don't know,\" or invent an answer. And I don't have any recollection of that.\nSCHUMER: OK, but we could take it, given your previous statements, that you would fully enforce the Hate Crimes Act?\nASHCROFT: I would fully the Hate Crimes Act were it to be passed, and...\nSCHUMER: A few acts of the Statistics Act has been passed already. I was the author on it.\nASHCROFT: All right, yes, sir.\nSCHUMER: You would. OK, and what would be your attitude towards the Hate Crimes Protection Act next year? Would you urge that we pass it, not pass it?\nASHCROFT: From what I know about the act now, I believe it to be constitutional. I would defend it if it were to be enacted by the Congress and passed by the president.\nSCHUMER: How about in the advocacy role?\nASHCROFT: I would have to confer with the president, obviously, before I endorsed any specific legislation.\nSCHUMER: But you wouldn't urge him to veto it on any constitutional or legal or moral basis?\nASHCROFT: Based on what I know now, I would not.\nSCHUMER: OK. Now, I'd like to just pursue a little further your follow-up, initially, to my questions earlier this morning. And Senator Kennedy had mentioned them, and then you began to clarify.\nI think what you were saying--and I'm just trying to clarify here--is that on the issue of choice, that when you were in the Missouri state government, you thought it was your right and certainly not unconstitutional to challenge and change the law.\nBut as United States attorney general that, because the Supreme Court has rule and recently in the Stenberg case said, \"This is settled law\"--something you just--that was your words...\nASHCROFT: That's regarding the denial of cert of that specific assault challenge on Stenberg.\nSCHUMER: ... that you would not--and I just want to get this clear--that you would not urge the solicitor general in any way to join suits to try and change those rulings; is that correct? That's what said to me earlier this morning...\nASHCROFT: I stand by my answer from this morning.\nSCHUMER: Thank you. Let me ask you this, then.\nLet us say people in the Senate and in the House try to introduce a statute that was identical or very similar--nearly identical--for all material purposes identical to the statute where the Supreme Court denied cert in the Nebraska case. Would you urge the president--a little step further, but the same basic reasoning--would you urge the president to veto it because it is unconstitutional based on the very same ruling the Nebraska case, in the Stenberg case?\nASHCROFT: Let me understand what you're saying, that if the Congress were to seek to do in exact language what the state of Nebraska did, what would my advice be to the president?\nSCHUMER: Correct. It passed both Houses. He has to sign it or veto it.\nASHCROFT: The president, when he announced his appointment of me, asked me not to share advice with the public that I would be asked by him. I would tell you this: that I would give him my best judgment as to what the law is. It would not be a result-oriented judgment. I have promised him that I would tell him the law. And I don't think it takes, when you have an on-point case, I think that's pretty clear what that advice would be.\nSCHUMER: And I'd just like you to say it, because it's not contradictory to what happened before. This is settled law in your judgment, settled law enough so that the solicitor general would not--you would not urge him to overturn it.\nWhy wouldn't the same--I'm not asking your advice to the president, I understand the difference there and respect it. But we're talking about the role that you have talked about quite well as implementer of the law and definer of constitutionality. This is not a moral issue, this is not an ideological issue; this is a constitutional issue, where it's extremely important for the attorney general to enforce the law, something you have repeated regularly today and yesterday.\nWhy wouldn't you just be able to tell us here? This is not a question of your private conversations about statutory or ideological views with the president. Why couldn't you say that, \"The law's unconstitutional and the president should veto it\"?\nASHCROFT: I would give the president my best estimate of the law. I think it's very clear that the Supreme Court has ruled on that particular law. The only change that could be made is if the federal government and its Congress had authority to do something that the state of Nebraska didn't do.\nI don't have--haven't considered that fully.\nSCHUMER: But the Supreme Court's ruling was a federal ruling, sir.\nASHCROFT: Yes, it was, but...\nSCHUMER: It was not based on state--Nebraska law. It was based on the right of--it was based on the federal right of privacy in the--as the Supreme Court has defined the Constitution and as you recently told us is settled law.\nI mean, this is an important issue, and some of us don't want to be unsettled that you have said this and are now, sort of, taking it back a little bit.\nASHCROFT: I'm not taking it back, sir. I will give my best judgment as to what the law is to the president whenever he asks me for legal advice. And that will be very clear. And the Nebraska statute was ruled unconstitutional and I will tell the president that.\nSCHUMER: And that the--excuse me, just--and that the same law that passed by the House and Senate is unconstitutional as well. The same exact law using the same federal ruling. What would prevent you from saying that if you--and I believe you have, if you truly believed what you told us before? There's no difference.\nASHCROFT: Well, nothing prevents me from saying it. And I believe the Nebraska law has been clearly ruled unconstitutional. And if you're asking for my personal view, I don't know of any reason why the federal Congress would be allowed to do what the state governments were forbidden to do.\nSCHUMER: You would tell the president it's unconstitutional.\nASHCROFT: I would tell him that I don't know of any reason the federal government has the authority to do what the state constitution--state group couldn't do, that was ruled unconstitutional at the state level. And it would--I guess I would have to say, I would expect the same to be the result from the federal level.\nSCHUMER: Thank you.\nThank you for your indulgence of a little extra time, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you. And I will certainly offer the senator from Ohio the same amount of extra time.\nSenator from Ohio?\nDEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\nSenator Ashcroft, thank you.\nIn examining your record as Missouri attorney general, it's clear that you had as part of your agenda the whole issue of consumer rights. You attacked pyramid schemes. You sued oil companies, charging them with restraint of trade. You had one case where you sued a company that was selling fraudulent franchises. They were claiming that they were helping disabled--many, many cases.\nI wonder if, as you define the job of attorney general and you look at your role as U.S. attorney general, you believe that that is also part of your mission, part of your agenda, as far as protection of consumers and consumer issues?\nASHCROFT: I thank the senator from Ohio.\nAs attorney general, I had a portfolio of consumer protection, and I ended up suing everybody from the oil companies, when they were either selling contaminated gasoline, or when they were price-fixing gasoline; remember cases like that. I sued the pyramid schemes because they were just a means of defrauding individuals. And I had the opportunity to sue people for fraudulent franchises and distributorships and all kinds of things like that.\nI don't know if the portfolio of the Justice Department is quite as extensive when it comes to consumer protection. I enjoyed that part of my responsibility and my job.\nAnd I also got involved in some things nationally that I thought were important for consumers. One thing that I have dealt with years and years later now here in the Congress, while I was a member of the Senate, was copyright laws regarding television and other programs.\nI sued as an amicus in the Sony Corporation v. Universal City Studios, which allowed people to tape-record television programs if they couldn't be home at the time the program was on so that they could later see it.\nBut I think that I'll do what I can to try and help consumers in settings, but I believe the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies of the government have the lion's share of consumer protection. And I'd be happy to learn if I could be involved in that arena, but my opportunity, I doubt, would be quite as extensive as it was when I was attorney general.\nDEWINE: Senator, thank you very much.\nMr. Chairman, thank you.\nLEAHY: Senator Durbin?\nDURBIN: Thank you very much.\nSenator Ashcroft, to follow up on Senator Schumer's question, for several years now we have been debating the so-called partial birth abortion ban on the floor of the United States Senate. And many of us have argued that, if it included a health exception for the woman involved, that we could support it.\nAnd Mr. Santorum from Pennsylvania has adamantly stuck to his position that it should not include a health protection. Now, the Stenberg v. Carhart decision, which has been the subject of this debate, really says that Casey gives us no choice. Casey case, which you referred to in your opening statement, made it clear that you had to include a health exception.\nYou can put whatever rebuttal witnesses you want on--want at that point...\nLEAHY: I understand.\nDURBIN: ... Congressman Hulshof, or others. But give this man his opportunity to sit before this committee and defend himself after what he's been through.\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, may I respond? And I have great respect for Justice White, but the issue is not what happened to Justice White, the issue is what is bearing on Senator Ashcroft. And we need to have a procedure which will enable this committee to find the facts fully.\nNow I think they ought to be together. But perhaps some middle ground would be that if Justice White testifies, and then Congressman Hulshof testifies and Justice White remains so that we're able to follow up with Justice White on what Congressman Hulshof has said. That's the only way we can have any conflict, which I anticipate will be present, and to let us find the facts.\nAnd the issue is not what happened to Justice White. The issue is what is going to happen to Senator Ashcroft.\nLEAHY: Well, if I might, just so people understand, Congressman Hulshof was invited to appear with the panel tonight. He will have an opportunity to appear. I've not met Congressman Hulshof, but he was kind enough to send me a detailed letter explaining to me how to do my job, and what the Senate should do in its--in caring out its responsibility.\nThat is very helpful to the Senate, and I appreciate his giving us the benefit of his experience and wisdom from the other body, as I always have. But perhaps I'm a slow learner, that I haven't understood fully what I should do to follow his directions.\nBut in any event what I will do as chairman, I will have the congressional panel, those members who are here today, Congressman Hulshof and other members who are unable to be here tonight, will also have an opportunity to be heard. I mean I will try certainly to get them onto a panel during the time when I'm chairman. If I can't, I am sure that Senator Hatch during the time he is chairman will be able to get them on to a panel.\nThe irony is, in the question of fairness, Congressman Hulshof will get the last word, because he will be testifying after Justice White testifies. Now it may well turn out that, as a suggestion was made of having Justice White testify again, maybe for a different reason than what the senator from Pennsylvania suggested, it may be because he feels he should talk.\nBut the point is we're not talking about confirmation of Justice White, but we are talking about the confirmation process of Attorney General-nominee John Ashcroft. Now he is--he has been able to testify by himself, although we have broken into his testimony several times at the request of Senator Hatch on behalf of himself and the Bush transition team, to have a long series of senators to come and speak on his behalf. We did that again today.\nIt's been somewhat unprecedented. We've had a senator from Texas, a senator from Maine, a former senator from Missouri. I intend though, out of courtesy to the nominee, did not bring--while he was here, did not bring another former senator from Missouri, who is opposed to his nomination; I did not bring other members of Congress who are opposed to his nomination to come in during that time.\nHe was allowed to interrupt any time Senator Hatch told me he wanted to, to bring in people to speak on his behalf, sit with him at the witness table and do it.\nBut just so we are not here all night long talking about what's going to happen, we'll go ahead and put into the record the kind letter from Congressman Hulshof explaining how I should do my job. I appreciate it, of course. I'm always open to suggestions and trust me, I get a lot of them; 17,000 e-mails in one day this week. And we'll go ahead with our panel.\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, did you say you were putting the letter in the record?\nLEAHY: Yes.\nSPECTER: OK, because I think that's important because this letter does not do what you said. This letter does not tell you how to do your job, and I think it's a disservice to Congressman Hulshof for you to make that statement. It certainly doesn't do that and I want to read the letter.\nLEAHY: Well, the letter was given to the press. I heard about it after he gave it to the press.\nSPECTER: I think I have the floor, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to read the letter because Congressman Hulshof's entitled to not be characterized as doing something that's taking on the business of the Senate.\nThis is what he says: \"Dear Senator Leahy, as a matter of personal privilege, I respectfully request that I be allowed to testify on the same witness panel as Judge Ronnie White during your confirmation hearings on the nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be United States attorney general.\n\"My appearance before the Judiciary Committee does not come becomes I am a sitting member of the U.S. House; my appearance is solely because I was co-counsel in the prosecution of a murder case which became a critical issue during the consideration of Judge White's nomination to the federal bench. I believe I can provide significant and unique testimony relevant to the State of Missouri v. James Johnson and Judge White's expected testimony.\n\"Your current invitation to have me testify as part of a panel consisting of interested members of Congress will not provide the Judiciary Committee with the full, fair and accurate account of the James Johnson case. I respectfully request that my appearance occur on the same panel as Judge White; any other invitation would reflect a politization of the hearing process. It would be unfair to the Senate, the incoming administration, the American people. Sincerely, Kenny Hulshof.\"\nNow, I believe that's very respectful. But if we're to have a process where these witnesses are not going to testify together and it comes down to the raw power of the chairman, then my suggestion would be to the incoming chairman that we reconvene the hearing on the afternoon of January 20 or Monday, January the 22nd, and call the two witnesses.\nLEAHY: Well, the incoming chairman, of course, would have that opportunity...\nHATCH: Well, I do not intend to do that. Let me bring this to closure.\n(CROSSTALK)\nHATCH: Let me just bring this to closure, because we have to go to our next witnesses.\n(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, I still haven't been recognized on this point either, and I would like to be, as a member of the committee.\nHATCH: Well, let me just say this, and then of course I'll step aside. Both Justice White and Congressman Hulshof are fact witnesses to the Ashcroft nomination. They're not appearing in their official capacities. All I'm asking is for basic fairness.\nNow, the chairman can do whatever the chairman wants to do. I'm not trying to embarrass him. I just feel deeply about this.\nAnd I think I have the reputation, over the last six years that I've been chairman of this committee before now, of allowing the minority to present opposition witnesses. I don't think that's an untoward request. And what it looks like is is that if you just have Justice White and no opposition witnesses who's a fact witness who is relevant to this on the same panel, then basically it just looks like you're setting aside one person and giving that person a single panel without any opposition; and then throwing a congressman in the mix with a bunch of very important, but other witnesses, who aren't at all concerned--or should I say aren't at all fact witnesses with regard to the issue in question.\nSo I just respectfully ask the chairman to think it over, and I hope that you will do that...\nLEAHY: Well, that...\nHATCH: ... because I think it's the right thing to do.\nLEAHY: What this tends to ignore, though, is the fact that, because Congressman Hulshof was not here this evening, as we'd expected, and several other members...\nHATCH: Well, neither is Justice White.\nLEAHY: ... and some of our other members of that panel are not here this evening, he actually has an advantage that everybody seems to be overlooking: He gets to appear after Justice White; he gets the last word.\nSPECTER: But if we're to have a process where these witnesses are not going to testify together and it comes down to the raw power of the chairman, then my suggestion would be to the incoming chairman that we reconvene the hearing on the afternoon of January 20 or Monday, January the 22nd, and call the two witnesses.\nLEAHY: Well, the incoming chairman, of course, would have that opportunity...\nHATCH: Well, I do not intend to do that.

Let me--and I'm going to...\nHATCH: Will he be on his own panel?\nLEAHY: I'm going to recognize--well, if you want to have him next Monday, you can. I'm going to recognize--or you can have him Saturday afternoon as--frankly, I'm...\nHATCH: I'm asking for fairness. I'm not asking for anything else.\nLEAHY: Unlike...\nHATCH: And if you don't want to do it, you're chairman and we'll live with it.\nLEAHY: Thank you. Orrin...\nHATCH: But I'm telling you, if you--and we'll put him on afterwards. But make him solely on the table then, just like Justice White.\nLEAHY: Orrin, Orrin, you can do whatever you want. Now, the senator from--and we don't need the histrionics.\nBut the senator from Pennsylvania--the senator from Pennsylvania suggested Saturday afternoon. I, like a loyal American, U.S. senator, will be at George Bush's inauguration Saturday afternoon. But you know, you do what you want.\nLet me--and I'm going to recognize the senator from Arizona first. But let me call to the table so we can at least try to get started--you are, after all, the one who asked me to move along here--Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\nWould you please come up and take your places?\nAnd I yield to, first, the senator from Arizona.\nKYL: Thank you.\nMr. Chairman, for six years I have been a subcommittee chairman of this committee. And I've held numerous hearings in which we created panels. And I've been told in every instance where we had a witness on one side that, of course, we had to accord the minority the right to have a witness on the same panel to deal with the same issue.\nI inquired as to whether that was a rule. And I was informed, no, it's not a rule, but it is a long-standing tradition and practice of the committee. Because, of course, it represents the rule of fairness that where you have a particular issue involved, it is fair for the minority to have a witness on the same panel as the majority.\nI would urge the chairman to think this over as well, because the chairman will be setting, I think, a very--if I could have the chairman's attention on this, because I'm actually speaking to you, Mr. Chairman. I don't want to be unkind here.\nI would urge the chairman to think this over carefully, because the chairman would be setting a precedent here. We're going to be in the majority, at least for a while, starting next Monday. And we would then have the right, under the last action of this chairman, under the precedent that he set, to deny the minority the right to have members or witnesses on panels that we create. I don't think that's a very good precedent.\nI think we should stick with the precedent of the committee. It's long-standing. It's traditional. It's fair. And it's pretty obvious, I think, what the effect of having just one witness on this panel would be, especially if it were not immediately followed by our witness dealing with the same subject, which as I understand it is not the chairman's intention.\nSo, while up to now I would consider this process very fair, I think it would be eminently unfair to proceed as the chairman suggests, but worse would create a precedent that, unfortunately, would provide the temptation to those in charge from thereafter to simply do what they wanted, irrespective of the interest of the minority.\nSo, I would urge the chairman to think this over this evening.\nLEAHY: I appreciate that. The precedent, of course, already exists--certainly has in the 26 years I've been here, three times the majority, twice the minority, and I've seen the precedent many times.\nIf Congressman Hulshof is that concerned about a hearing with his colleagues from the House, then we can arrange a time...\nKYL: That's not what we're asking for.\nLEAHY: We can arrange a time for him to appear by himself so that he'd have the same treatment that Justice White is having. But I told all of you I would try to move these things forward. Let Senator Hatch and I talk about that. Let's start with the witnesses who are here today.\nHATCH: Let me just make one last comment. Regardless of what your decision is here today, should I become chairman of this committee, I'm going to practice what I've always practiced, and that is that if the minority has an off-setting witness, they're going to be able to call that witness. And I don't care what your decision is, that's what I'm going to do.\nBut I asked my colleague--and we've gotten along very well and, frankly, I think you've done a very good job in these hearings. I'm hopeful that you'll think this over and I would even agree: Let Justice White go first if you want and then call Ken Hulshof--Congressman Hulshof by himself immediately afterwards. And then if Justice White doesn't like what he says, you can bring him back; that would be fine with me. But I'd like to have this resolved because it's only fair. If it wasn't fair, that's another matter, but it's so clear on its face that it's fair.\nBut just to make the record clear, should I become chairman, the minority will have a right that I hope we will not be barred from having as a minority here, and I will just treat it that way. So we'll leave it at that. That's all I can do.\nLEAHY: The senator of Utah knows I have stopped this hearing several times to bring in witnesses that I had not been told we were going to have until the very last second. I have accommodated him. I have put them in. I've been trying to accommodate everybody there. We could have had a whole another round at his request and on behalf of Senator Ashcroft, though, we won't go into our full private conversation, I worked at having senators who might have wanted to do it--ask further questions not to do it.\nCongresswoman Waters?\nU.S. REPRESENTATIVE MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you this evening.\nI respect the tremendous responsibility that you have in a matter such as this. It is very serious, and I know that you will do the very best job that you can. I'm here because this issue, this confirmation is extremely important to me and to people that I represent.\nI have listened very carefully to Senator John Ashcroft yesterday and today. It is clear to me that John Ashcroft is attempting to deny the passion and poor judgment he has displayed on certain critical issues, such as abortion, guns, civil rights and voter rights. He would have us believe that, despite his extreme positions, we should trust him to be the attorney general of the United States of America, with the responsibility for enforcing the nation's laws.\nI hate to say this, members, but I must share with you, I simply do not trust John Ashcroft. I believe he is simply saying whatever he believes is necessary to be confirmed. John Ashcroft has a record of opposing minorities nominated to key positions by President Bill Clinton, such as Bill Lann Lee, David Satcher, Judge Ronnie White.\nAnd it was his unprincipled attack on Judge White that really caught my attention. Ronnie White had bipartisan support during the Judiciary Committee hearing. He was also supported by Kit Bond, the other United States senator from Missouri. John Ashcroft used Ronnie White as a pawn in his re-election campaign. He manufactured an argument that Ronnie White was soft on crime.\nAfter Ronnie White's confirmation had been voted out of committee, John Ashcroft organized fringe police groups to oppose the confirmation. John Ashcroft then recruited Kit Bond and other Republicans to vote against Judge White on the Senate floor.\nRonnie White's career has been seriously damaged by an unusual party-line vote simply because John Ashcroft misrepresented this African-American man as a poster boy for \"soft on crime,\" and portrayed Judge White as being too liberal and too dangerous to be entrusted with a lifetime tenure to the federal bench.\nAll this was a shameless, cheap political sabotage of a fine judge who had worked his way out of poverty to obtain an education and serve his country and his state.\nWhat John Ashcroft did was not honest. He knowingly distorted Ronnie White's record and misrepresented decisions Judge White had made, twisting and distorting his judicial record.\nJohn Ashcroft's position on abortion is extreme. He rabidly opposes a woman's freedom of choice even in cases of incest and rape. In addition, information disclosed by Senator Kennedy during this hearing today documented the actions John Ashcroft took to thwart voter registration by the people of St. Louis, particularly the black, the poor and the disadvantaged. These revelations are startling and unsettling.\nI am particularly concerned about his record in Missouri because I was born in Missouri, attended those segregated schools in St. Louis, Missouri, and I witnessed poverty and exclusion of African-Americans in that city. We had a rough time growing up in St. Louis, Missouri. And I was in St. Louis four years ago during an election where there was disenfranchisement and I called the Justice Department from there.\nI know that people like John Ashcroft--now I know that people like him are responsible for dashing the hopes and dreams of poor people and African-Americans because of the kinds of decisions they make in their role as public policy-makers.\nWe've heard no reasonable explanation from John Ashcroft about his obstruction of efforts to educate and train voting registrars from St. Louis. When these disclosures are added to his attempts to block desegregation programs in Missouri, we are left with a nominee who should not and must not be confirmed.\nI would be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nLEAHY: I should point out also Congressman Waters has been here a great deal and I know that Congresswoman Jackson Lee has been present throughout these hearings; is probably as weary as the rest of us. But the senator from Utah and I see her often on the House Judiciary Committee and she's a respected member of that.\nAnd I'm glad to have you here. Congresswoman, go ahead.\nU.S. REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Might I add my appreciation for the fair and impartial way in which you have conducted these hearings.\nAnd to Mr. Hatch, the ranking member, let me thank you as well for your graciousness and those of the members--the members who have here, Senator Durbin, and, of course, the members who are here as well that were kind enough to allow us to participate this evening.\nIf I might--to capture the essence of the nature of concern that many of us have with respect to the nomination of Senator Ashcroft, I think it goes to a statement made by Dr. Martin Luther King in 1962. \"It may be true that law can't make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me.\"\nCertainly, many of us in the 21st century would like to think that those kinds of travesties are behind us. And if I was here to contest Senator Ashcroft's conservative views, I would be hypocritical. If I was here to contest his religious vigor, I'd be likewise hypocritical. For our democracy allows us to hold a number of different and diverse beliefs, and I am proud of the fact that we live in a democratic society that gives us that privilege.\nBut I do want to say to this committee that I am a product of a segregated America. I know what it is to be bused to a school to integrate that school. I've lived with people who, in varying ways, have either been hurt or harmed or felt intimidated because of the color of their skin, because someone treated them differently. I had, maybe, the privilege to understand what it's like to ride in the back of a train with a brown paper bag with food because I could not go to the car where food was served.\nThis is an emotional and passionate time for many of us. And we thought that as we crossed the bridge into the 21st century, we might have a time we might not have to look upon those times in our lives when we were treated so differently and distinct and others took it lightly that we should even be concerned.\nSo the reason I am here as a member of the House Judiciary Committee and representing constituents from a southern state, the state of Texas, that itself has faced the challenge of integration over segregation, is to tell you that what bothers me and bothers my constituents is what has been shown in Senator Ashcroft's record.\nChairman Leahy, I have spent time in this hearing room and I've heard a man say quite differently, quite in contrast to his record. He speaks eloquently now about Roe v. Wade, but I know, as a young woman growing up, what it meant now to have the protection of the law; women who lost their lives in back-room alley abortions. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, but it is a life-and-death issue.\nI also understand very well this whole question of discrimination, because I am a product of watching Martin Luther King be assassinated, and I take very seriously his day of honor, January 15, the day we honor him as we honored him this week. Many of us still cry when we hear the words, \"We shall overcome.\"\nAnd so I come again, I hope not in the viewpoint of being in opposition to an American who has presented himself to this country for service, nor particularly in opposition to the president's right to choose his Cabinet. I would say to President-elect Bush that I was taught to believe a person's word, and I do believe he indicated that he would seek to find ways of healing this nation and bringing us together.\nI do believe when you reject people because they are different, such as Ambassador Hormel, that you do raise the question of whether you can accept in your spirit, in your heart and in the practice of law, the fact that we are all created equal.\nCharlene Hunter, the Little Rock Nine and James Meredith represent the names that we somewhat identify with kicking open the doors of opportunity, quality in higher education. It doesn't seem right that just about 20 years ago, Attorney General Ashcroft was in the middle of denying equal opportunity to education. It seems that is was something that did not really have to be done, which is one of the reasons that I come before you.\nJohn Ashcroft, as attorney general and as governor of the state of Missouri, consistently opposed efforts to desegregate schools in Missouri, which, for more than 150 years, had legally sanctioned separate and inferior education for blacks.\nLet me cite for you a report, the Woodstock (ph) report, that talks about the fact that we have not overcome in desegregating our schools. As recently as 1993, it said, \"while there has been significantly an amount of success in school desegregation over the last 25 years, in general segregation has not decreased significantly. Since 1970, in fact, in some areas it has gotten worse. Today, 22 or 23 of the 25 largest central-city school districts in this nation are predominantly minority.\"\nWhat that means to this committee is that, yes, an attorney general of this vintage, of this era, of this millennium will still have issues of how do we desegregate.\nMissouri had a long and marked historically of systematically discriminating against African-Americans in the provision of public education. And during 45 years of slavery, the state forbid the education of blacks. After the Civil War, Missouri was the most northern state to have a constitutional mandate requiring separate schools for blacks and whites.\nThis constitutional provision remained in place until 1976. For much of its history, Missouri provided vastly inferior services to black students.\nAfter the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, the Missouri Attorney General's Office, rather than ordering the dismantling of segregation, simply issued an opinion that local districts may permit white and colored children to attend the same schools and could decide for themselves whether they must integrate. Local schools in St. Louis and Kansas City perpetrated segregation by manipulating attendance boundaries, drawing discriminatory busing plans and building new schools in places to keep races apart.\nThe St. Louis case that is relevant in this proceeding over these next days was filed in 1972. St. Louis had adhered to an explicit system of racial segregation throughout the 1960s. It took a long time. White students were assigned to schools in their neighborhood, black students to black schools in the core of the city, black students who resided outside the city were bused into black schools in the city. The city had launched no effort to integrate, it simply adopted neighborhood school assignment plans that maintained racial segregation.\nThere was a need for healing, there was a need for leadership, there was a need to get outside of the box of the representation that the senator made that he was only representing the state.\nIn 1972, Minnie LaDell (ph) and a group of black students filed a class action lawsuit against St. Louis City Board of Education. And contrary to the senator's testimony, the state was made a party to this action, and the 8th Circuit ultimately found that the state and the city school board were responsible for maintaining school segregation for many years following Brown and that they acted in violation of the constitutional rights of the plaintiff school children. With this ruling the, 8th Circuit ordered that a desegregation plan be revised.\nAnd in 1980, the parent and student plaintiffs, along with the city board, amended complaints seeking a metropolitan school desegregation remedy. They did it voluntarily. They worked together. Subsequently, the district court announced a voluntarily inter-district desegregation plan and added that the 22nd St. Louis County School Districts as defendants--or added them as defendants.\nSenator Ashcroft, then attorney general, challenged the desegregation plan. He argued that there was no basis for holding the state liable and that the state had taken the necessary and appropriate steps to remove the legal underpinnings of the segregated schooling as well as affirmatively prohibiting such discrimination. The courts rejected the attempts, they characterized his acts as dilatory.\nIn 1983, the city school board and the 22 suburban districts all agreed to unique and comprehensive settlement, implementing a voluntary five-year school desegregation plan for both the city and the county. Importantly, the plan was voluntary. It relied on voluntary transfers by students rather than so-called forced busing. The district court approved the plan. And, again, Attorney General Ashcroft, representing the state, was the only one that did not join the settlement. He opposed all aspects of the settlement. In fact, he sought to have it overturned.\nThe 8th Circuit upheld, however, most of the provision of the plan and emphasized that three times over the prior three years it had specifically held that the state was the primary constitutional violator. Not satisfied then, Senator Ashcroft sought review in the Supreme Court and was denied his request. And even after his unsuccessful appeal, Senator Ashcroft continued to obstruct the operation of the settlement, leading the district court to conclude, \"If it were not for the state of Missouri and its feckless appeals perhaps none of us would be here at this time.\"\nAnd when he became governor, Governor Ashcroft continued to obstruct the desegregation plan of the state's educational institutions well into the 1990s.\nJudge Stephen Limbaugh, who was appointed by President Reagan, actually stated that the state was ignoring the real objections of this case: a better education for city students in public schools.\nMight I say to you this: I wanted to chronicle the history of this desegregation order and plan, not because this committee is not brilliant in its own way, and secured its own information, but I personally needed to add to you a very disheartened voice. I don't know how long I can continue, maybe, without feeling real deep pain.\nI would hope that Senator Ashcroft's representation before this committee were absolutely true, that he could vigorously defend the laws, whether it's Roe v. Wade, affirmative action as it is in the federal law--mend it; don't end it--it still exists, the Voters' Rights Act of 1965, which has to be reauthorized.\nBut there is another key element to being the attorney general of the United States of America. It is the perception that vulnerable people have about what the federal government does and I am reminded of what happened in Little Rock. They called President Eisenhower. They called President Kennedy. They called President Lyndon Baines Johnson. And the men that had to act at that time, since it was not women, were the attorney generals of the United States of America.\nAnd when they acted, they acted sometimes out of the realm--not out of the rule of law, but out of the realm of what was popular or what was standard or what was the basis, or maybe what was even centennial law, in order to ensure that vulnerable people were protected. Every single day, more so than Health and Human Services or Commerce, more so than the secretary of state, the Department of Justice is called upon to work for the vulnerable--Alabama, Ohio, Utah, Vermont, Illinois, California, Texas and elsewhere.\nWhat disturbs me, Mr. Chairman, and why I ask this committee to consider the record of Senator Ashcroft, is the fact of whether or not he can be the protector that needs to be for the people of the United States.\nI will close by simply saying this. I know that Judge White will present himself tomorrow. I, however, believe, that temperament of words is a key element as well. All of us will live by what we say. And I believe that words that would suggest a jurist has a pro-criminal bent based upon one case or cases that are a bare minimum, if you will, of the cases that he decided, shows some question of an individual's temperament for protecting the vulnerable.\nI thank the committee for their kindness and the opportunity to make my testimony this evening.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much, both Congresswoman Waters and Congresswoman Jackson Lee.\nI think that testimony is extremely important. And I can't begin to summarize either the eloquence or depth of your statement. Let me touch both of you on three points.\nThere is discussion of Roe v. Wade. I remember the days of the back-alley abortionists. I prosecuted one of the worst people I ever knew. We first found out about what he was doing when I was called to the emergency room of our local hospital. The young woman, in her teens, college student, in the area of school, nearly died of a botched abortion. She lived; sterile as a result.\nThis particular person who I then prosecuted that was doing this, we found that he had arranged this back-room program. He would bring young, pregnant women to Montreal. Abortions would be conducted by a woman who learned how to conduct abortions by working for the SS at Auschwitz. He would then blackmail these women for money or for sex.\nNow, I was a young prosecutor, father of three children, in my 20s. I prosecuted him. I convicted him. But I went a step further. I arranged a case which became Beecham v. Leahy in Vermont. It was a precursor of Roe v. Wade. And basically, Vermont took the same position as Roe v. Wade, and said that abortions--under appropriate medical circumstances, all would be legal.\nI'd already arranged that in our county, because I made it very clear that there would not be prosecutions within the hospital area. It's now the law in Vermont anyway. Now, of course, it was case law, now it's statutory law. So I understand that.\nYou've spoken of Justice White. And I understand how easy it is to condemn a judge who usually cannot respond. But I know--and I've spoken about this on the floor of the Senate--how terrible it is when that condemnation because one disagrees with a judge who said, not that, \"I want to release a person who'd been charged with a heinous crime, and by all accounts was guilty of a heinous crime.\" He never said, \"I want to release him.\" He said, \"I want to make sure he's guaranteed a fair trial.\"\nI mean, to condemn him for that is almost like condemning an attorney who is assigned to represent a criminal. They're fulfilling and upholding our Constitution to do so.\nNow, some may agree or disagree in the law that he applied. But what he was saying is not release a criminal, but guarantee that all of us have a fair trial, because that guarantees that the guilty are punished, the innocent remain free.\nNow, how anybody could condemn that--and I was both a defense attorney and a prosecutor--I don't know.\nHe's been labeled a number of things. He voted to uphold convictions 95 percent of the times that the justices of the Missouri Supreme Court appointed by then-Governor Ashcroft. So I understand that.\nOne area that you've experienced, though, both of you, and I've known you both for years, that really touches me that I can't know--I come from a state which is 98, 99 percent, I haven't got the latest census records, white. I think probably when we talk about ethnic groups, minority groups in Vermont, we're talking about recent immigrants to our state either from Canada or other countries, like my grandparents or my parents-in-law.\nThe relationships between whites and blacks, I've learned in my years of going to law school here, or on the first trip that I made as an 18-year-old, which would be 1958, to Washington with my parents sightseeing, and seeing segregated water fountains, inconceivable in our state of Vermont--I mean, we wouldn't know what you do with them--seeing that here in Washington, D.C., the capital.\nNow, what I have learned, though, in my years here, I think a depth of the feeling, feeling that you've expressed far more eloquently than I ever could. And what I have learned is that all of us, white, black or whatever, who serve in positions of trust in the government of this country, or the government of our state, have a responsibility to everybody. That's not just to say, \"I have no bias, I have no prejudice or anything else,\" but to make sure you take the steps necessary to demonstrate that it is an inclusive, not an exclusive society, a society I want for my children and grandchildren; I want to be inclusive, not exclusive.\nWe're a nation of 280 million Americans.\nIt's our inclusiveness that makes us strong. It's our exclusiveness that shatters us and makes us weak.\nNow there are only 100 of us who can vote on a question of a presidential nomination. When we vote, we have to ask do we include or do we exclude?\nThe senator from Utah?\nHATCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I won't keep you long.\nI want to express my gratitude to both of you for being here today, and being here this late this evening, and for the eloquent statements that you've made.\nI'll just say this. I was raised in poverty and I learned a trade as a young man. I was fortunate enough because my father was a skilled tradesman and I was able to join the union. And we had three African-American latherers in our local and they always got the worst work there was. And I worked with them, not very much, but I was one of the few who did and I was proud to do it.\nAnd that meant, on one occasion, if I can remember it correctly, climbing with about a 65-pound toolbox on one arm, straight up five floors up to about the 15th floor of a building one rung at a time, and then putting floor lath down, which was the most back-breaking work there was, which is what they were given. So I sense very strongly and feel very deeply about your feelings.\nNow I also know Senator Ashcroft very well, and I believe, having watched him very closely, that when he says he'll do something, he will do it. He's a religious man. He's a very good man. He's had 30 years in public policy--at least 27 to 28 years--I guess I'd say about 30 years. And I'm sure anybody who's been in public work for that long is going to have a record that can be condemned from time to time by somebody. But everybody here knows he's a man of integrity and when he says he'll do something, I think he will.\nBut I just wanted to make that point. I don't want to prolong this.\nI want to thank you both for being here. Respect both of you, as you know. And I'm grateful that you could be here and express your particular points of view.\nLEAHY: Senator Durbin?\nDURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd to my two friends and former colleagues from the House, thank you for your patience. I've watched you all day, sitting there listening as we've gone through this committee hearing. And it says a lot about your commitment to this issue and this nomination that you would wait here for this opportunity to speak.\nAnd Congresswoman Waters, I grew up across the river in East St. Louis. And so we come from similar backgrounds.\nAnd Congresswoman Jackson Lee, thank you too for being here.\nI'm a product of the '60s. I naively believed, as a college student, that if we could pass those civil rights laws that my children wouldn't even understand what racism was all about, wouldn't understand what prejudice meant. I'd have to sit down and explain that's the way it used to be. Things have gotten better, and thank goodness for that.\nBut I've come to understand that it just isn't the law that makes it better. You need a government that believes in that law, that enforces that law and implements that law. And doesn't just do it out of duty, but does it out of a heartfelt commitment that government is not an abstract unit, that government consists of people.\nAnd the reason why this committee, this Judiciary Committee, seems to struggle with the question of race so frequently is because the Department of Justice is really the place we turn to when it comes to civil rights. We want to know that whoever is heading that department not only understands the law and their legal obligation, but has a commitment in their heart to make sure that it works.\nI have not accused Senator Ashcroft of racial prejudice, nor will I. I don't believe that's appropriate. But I do question some of the decisions which he's made, which have raised questions in the minds of people who wonder if he has that heartfelt commitment.\nWhat happened to Justice Ronnie White should never happen to anyone. To be pilloried on the floor of the United States Senate at being pro-criminal after what that man has gone through in his life and his professional background, that's why I believe it's appropriate for him to sit in that chair tomorrow, by himself, with that microphone and defend himself; for the first time in over a year to have a chance to tell his side of the story.\nThe rebuttal witnesses will have their time, too. But he deserves that respect.\nAnd I said it to Senator Ashcroft today, and I will repeat it: I believe what happened to him was disgraceful and I don't believe the facts back it up. And if Senator Ashcroft disagreed with one decision or another, that's not enough to reject a man who had waited over two for that opportunity.\nCongresswoman Jackson Lee, that school desegregation story, that Senator Kennedy has returned to time and time again, is an important one and it's I think, especially important to note that we are talking about a voluntary desegregation plan. The people in St. Louis came together and said, \"Put the judges aside for a minute; let's let the parents and teachers and administrators and interested citizens find a solution for our community,\" and consistently ran into opposition from Senator Ashcroft in his official public positions.\nThat's what causes some concern and questions as to whether he has the heartfelt commitment to make sure that the laws are implemented well.\nThank you both for being here. Your testimony makes a big difference.\nLEAHY: The senator from Pennsylvania?\nSPECTER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nJust a word or two. Thank you for coming. Thank you for staying. We're in the 11th hour of this hearing today. At 10 a.m., we're standing room only. Now there are plenty of seats if anybody wants to come and see the hearing--easy access to the Russell Senate Office Building.\nI appreciate what you congresswomen have had to say. You're both very vigorous advocates. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is outspoken. She's outspoken me on a number of occasions when we've been on shows together.\nAnd with Congresswoman Maxine Waters, just a very short story. I chaired the Intelligence Committee a few years back and we were having a hearing on whether the CIA was selling narcotics in Los Angeles to finance the Contras. And Congresswoman Waters came in to quietly raise a point or two, and I invited her to sit on the panel, made her a part of the Senate panel. I demoted you for a day, Congresswoman Waters.\nAnd I understand your concerns about civil rights, about the issues you've raised and I won't detail why I understand them, but I do and I don't have to talk about a record here.\nWe all can't agree on everything. And my vantage point of Senator Ashcroft's a little different, having worked with him very closely and he's answered a lot of very pointed questions, and there'll be a lot of congressional, senatorial oversight.\nBut, you're a couple of fighters and I have great respect for you. Thank you.\nLEAHY: I thank the senator from Pennsylvania.\nThe senior senator from New York?\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me join all of my colleagues here in the Senate in thanking the two Congressmembers, not only for their testimony but for their diligence and patience. They're both former colleagues of mine and we both work together, Maxine and I on the Banking Committee, and Sheila and I on the Judiciary Committee, and we had a lot of good times over there.\nLet me ask just one question here--and I agree with Senator Durbin and all my colleagues: I do not believe that Senator Ashcroft is a racist. I believe that he has appointed people of color to high office. And I think those of us who are on the more liberal side of the spectrum shouldn't demand that diversity means ideological similarity.\nWhat troubles me here is a certain insensitivity, I guess I would say, to the long and tortured history of race as a problem in America. And that to me, that insensitivity deals with the always present, or often present, double standard. In other words, the way I would look at something is, I would try, and I think we all should try, to be very careful when you are opposing a black person for an office, you ought to make sure that you've imposed the same standard on everybody else. And you wouldn't normally have to do that if we didn't have a history of racism, and if we didn't have a history of racial division, then you would just say, \"Let's look at the merits,\" and go for it.\nAnd certainly, my views on crime issues and the views of both of you are not quite the same, as we learned during the crime bill. But that, to me, is not the issue. It's not a question of whether Judge White was soft on crime. Senator Ashcroft could well believe in good conscious that he was. The question is, did Senator Ashcroft apply the same standard to Judge White's, quote, \"soft on crime\" stance, that he applied to other judges?\nI can't remember the numbers in his testimony, but he voted to approve something like, I don't know, 210 out of the 240 judicial appointments that President Clinton put together.\nMy guess is--I have not researched this, although I hope by tomorrow morning I will--that a good number of--or some number of the judges that Senator Ashcroft voted for were probably more liberal on crime issues than Judge White. That is the troublesome thing here. I think, as a senator, as an American, and certainly as an attorney general, we need somebody who's going to be sensitive to that issue; that because a double standard has existed in America for so long--we've made progress in eradicating that standard over the last 30 or 40 years, but it's still there all too often--that one has to be sensitive to that. And the job of attorney general demands particular sensitivity.\nI understand there was a political campaign going on, and I understand that when you get down to the wire there are lots of things any human being, all of us included, might do. But I think there are certain areas off-limits, and one of them is not being sensitive to that double standard, because double standards have been so poisonous to America for our history.\nAnd I just wonder if either of you would like to comment on that concept.\nWATERS: I certainly would like to comment on that concept, Senator.\nI want to try and share something with you that may help you to understand our very, very deep feelings about something like this.\nFirst of all, let me just say this. Having been reared in St. Louis, Missouri, where there was a lot of poverty and segregated schools and parents who were striving very hard to give their children a chance, and I mean it was rough, just as Judge Ronnie White describes how he used to clean up, worked as a janitor as a kid in the White Castle stores, we started working when we were 11 and 12 years old.\nWe didn't work for extra money. We worked because if we didn't work, we wouldn't have any clothes to go to school with. And during the summertime we took jobs in segregated restaurants. I worked in Thompson's (ph) where black people couldn't eat. And at lunch time we could not eat in the restaurant. We had to eat in the basement.\nWe did that because we had to have clothes to go back to school in September. All of the kids in our neighborhood starting working at a very early age and many of us not only bought clothes, but the dollars that we earned helped to feed the other kids.\nThere was no birth control. My mother had 13 children. She had a fourth-grade education. And she worked on the polls. She didn't know a lot. She could not help a lot of the people who wanted to vote. That's why this business about excluding St. Louis in the voter registration training of registrars, kind of, strikes at me. I watched her work on the polls and do the best that she could. She believed in voting. And a lot of people in our neighborhood did not believe in voting.\nAnd so when you talk about these things, we are not relating to them in abstract. It touches us very, very deeply and it hurts.\nNow, when you talk about the insensitivity, it could be described as that. But, you know, there's something called a thousand nicks.\nLEAHY: Called a what?\nWATERS: A thousand nicks. They add up. And when the nicks continue over a period of time, then you define yourself. You define yourself in ways that many of us, who have had to be on the lookout all of our lives for the obstacles, how to get around them, how to keep people from limiting our opportunity, we know it when we see it and he fits the description.\nAnd I want to tell you that the insensitivity that you describe is even deeper than that, because to be an African-American man, who's had to struggle through poverty and struggle through all that he had to go through with, knowing that you have to be better than most in order to get something like an appointment to the federal bench--there are not many of us who get appointments like that--and you work your way up.\nAnd you work hard, you play by the rules. You do everything that you possibly can. And you get the support in the Judiciary Committee, bipartisan support. And you have a lot of supporters with you. Only to be stopped on the floor in an unusual and extraordinary way, is beyond insensitivity.\nYou cannot fall back and describe yourself as being a person of high moral character and a person deeply steeped in religion. We know something about religion, too. And it teaches us to be better than that.\nYou don't destroy human beings simply because you have the power to do it. You help people. You don't take this vulnerable African-American man, who's worked all of his life against the odds to get to a place where most of us will never get, and sandbag him because, all of a sudden, you've got an election, and he becomes the poster boy for your election. And you can only be appealing to a certain element in our society with that kind of argument.\nIt's beyond sensitivity, Senator. And I want you to know, that that's when he really caught my attention. And I want to tell you, he could sit here and he could say to us over and over again, \"Well, I did that then, but I'm going to be better. Yes, I know I've been passionate on this, but I'm going to enforce the laws.\" It does not ring true. It does not ring true.\nAnd let me close by saying this, and it's kind of a secret I'll share with you about what happens in African-American communities and in homes. We fear for our children and we fear for these black boys. And I can recall when my son was in school in a certain place in a state that was known to have Ku Klux Klan activity, and he met a very nice young, white boy who wanted him to go to his house for Thanksgiving. But it was in a community where there were no blacks and this community had a reputation.\nAnd I said to my son, \"You can't do that. You cannot do that. You cannot be caught in a community where we know there's been some problems in the past, no matter how much you like your friend and no matter how good you think he is. He probably is a very fine person. But we know that if you get caught at the wrong time and the wrong place, you will become fodder for people whose intentions are not honorable, for people who are racists, for people who would destroy you.\"\nAnd we to continue to remind our children day in and day out about what they can't do, where they can't be, how they got to be careful.\nAnd Ronnie White followed all of the rules, and he had to be careful in order to get where he got. And to be treated the way that he was treated, to be sandbagged the way that he was treated, he'll never get over it, and his career may have been damaged forever.\nAnd so, yes, I understand what you're saying, Senator, about sensitivity. But let me just tell you, those of us who have to guard against getting sandbagged all of our lives call it something else, goes a little bit deeper than simply a lack of sensitivity.\nJACKSON LEE: Will the chairman allow me to...\nLEAHY: Of course.\nJACKSON LEE: He said one or both of us.\nAnd I feel compelled to respond, Senator Schumer, because I think you captured the relationships, the working relationships. We can all work together. You worked with both of us, Congresswoman Waters and myself. And Senator Hatch made a comment as well, along with Senator Durbin, on this whole issue of race. And I want to just refer you, and we asked the question, where were we on the day, tragically, of the assassination of President Kennedy? Many of us ask the same question of where we were the day Martin Luther King was killed.\nThis is not an attempt to create hysteria as much as it is an attempt to characterize for you what we hear and see. We still have heroes in the African-American community, and we still look to that one judge on the Missouri Supreme Court. It was Ronnie White. He's a hero. It was an honor.\nYou may think that African-Americans did not pay attention to that journey on the floor of the Senate, but they did. And, frankly, they viewed the actions of Senator Ashcroft more as a shredding of a man's reputation and his dignity.\nI read the transcript when he came to this committee, and he introduced his wife and his son and he was proud of that and he had his aide here. I saw the language of Senator Kit Bond, in fact, that said he had the necessary qualifications and character traits which were required for the job. William Clay, who is not--who retired, presented him and mentioned that he went first to Senator Ashcroft to get his blessings and believed that he had it.\nI just want to put into the record the numbers, as I conclude, about this whole issue of the death penalty cases, because whenever you see faces like mine you immediately box us in. There is a diverse opinion in our communities on crime and the death penalty, and I can assure you that the African-American community are law-abiding. They are intimidated by crime. They want to make sure those who are convicted fairly of a crime, the crime is addressed. But that is no reason to blanket us and to assume that Justice White could be so tattered and tainted without really looking into his record.\nWe find that Judge White voted to uphold the death sentence in 41 of the 59 cases that came before him, roughly the same proportions Ashcroft's court appointees when he was governor. In fact, of these 59 death penalty cases, Judge White was the sole dissenter in only three of them; that means that he was drawing the other members of the Missouri Supreme Court.\nAnd lastly, what seemed to not get to be part of the record is the 15 cases--and it may be in this record, of course--of which Judge White wrote the majority.\nSenator Biden asked the question to Senator Ashcroft that I think was never asked. Justice Scalia wrote an opinion, in contrary to what you think his views were as it relates to the death penalty, which might have been characterized as liberal. Meaning that it might have been characterized as an opinion where the defendant was given the right to redress his grievances.\nThe question is, did Senator Ashcroft go to the floor of the House to comment on that decision or maybe other decisions of like-situated individuals, or did he single out Justice White?\nAnd so the question I have, on both the segregation or desegregation order, and as well as Justice White, it is not where we stand in times of comfort and calm. It is not the 200 non-controversial appointees that the Clinton administration put forward, even in the Foreign Relations Committee or the Judiciary Committee. We all can find common ground on the non-controversial. It is not the question of whether or not we have friends that we don't have it in our heart.\nSenator Hatch, I don't have any reason to believe that Senator Ashcroft is racist in his spirit, his heart. I only go on his record and his actions, and what I ask the question is--and so I make no accusations here--but what I ask the question is, the vulnerable need the attorney general. I need him; my community needs him. And he will have to make decisions in controversy. He will have to make decisions when it is unpopular to do what is right.\nMy challenge is, or the question I raise is, why in the voluntary efforts of his community, why he didn't rise to the occasion, the man of faith, a man who loved this country, to heal us, applaud the agreement, bring the agreement to the point of success, use his office to guide the agreement to a successful legal end, and a successful end in terms of the communities having it work.\nAnd lastly, with Justice White, why did he not, in the course of making a decision about Justice White, rise in this controversial time that had been created, to the point of looking at his holistic record, for the greater good, rising above politics, and championing Justice White's nomination and successful vote on the floor of the Senate?\nIt is where you stand in time of controversy. And that's what African-Americans, but as well, vulnerable Americans, look to the attorney general's position and the Department of Justice; will you help us when we need you?\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nThe senior senator from Ohio?\nDEWINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI just want to thank our witnesses for their patience today. And appreciate their testimony. I don't have any questions.\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama?\nSESSIONS: Thank the witnesses. It's good to see you.\nAnd Congresswoman Lee, you've been here all day. I've seen--kind of wish you could have been on this side and maybe seen John's testimony on the face. I think he was very sincere. And I think you'll be very pleased with his service.\nLEAHY: Unless there are further questions, we will stand in recess until 9:30 in the morning.\nJACKSON LEE: Thank you so very much.\nWATERS: Thank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nAnd I want to make it clear in my mind that the Santorum bill, which has been debated and voted on in the House, and the Senate now, based on what you've said today and what we understand Stenberg and Carhart to say, clearly would be unconstitutional and that it does not meet the test, in Stenberg v. Carhart, of providing for protection for the health of the woman.\nASHCROFT: If legislation regarding partial birth abortion is passed by the United States Senate, I will ask department lawyers to assemble the best assessment of that legislation and evaluate its pluses and minuses and its likelihood of constitutionality. And I would advise the president of that. If it is arguably constitutional, I would defend it, because I think that's the responsibility of an attorney general.\nI think it is important to be able to advise the president confidentially, because you might find yourself in a setting where you advise the president that something is unconstitutional, but he decides to sign it. And because it is arguably constitutional, but maybe not going to be constitutional, you go in to defend it.\nNow, if you have advised the president publicly that this is probably unconstitutional, but it could be constitutional and then he signs it and you have to go defend it, you've cut the legs out from under your ability to effectively sustain the enactment or argue for its sustenance in the course. So...\nDURBIN: Senator, this element of protecting the health of the women is clearly the decision made in Stenberg v. Carhart based on Casey, a case which you, yesterday, said in your opening statement was settled law of the land. It is not a question of constitutionality if it is settled law of the land in your mind. And how then could you have any question, as you sit there, and say, \"Well, maybe Stenberg really didn't say the health of the women\"? It was based on Casey and it related to protecting the health of the women. And Santorum, which we've considered in the Senate for years now, does not include that protection.\nI can't think of a clearer illustration of your earlier statement where you said the administration is not going to set out to overturn Roe v. Wade, and that you were committed to the settled law of Roe v. Wade and Casey.\nASHCROFT: I am and I would advise the administration, in regard to any legislation that it was considering that I considered Casey and Roe v. Wade and Stenberg to be settled law. And in evaluating any proposed enactment or any enactment which came for signature to the president, I would advise them with that understanding. It's possible--the number of permutations in legislation, as we all know, is infinite.\nAnd I would give my best advice to the president. I would give it to him privately, because if he signed something, it would be my responsibility to defend it and seek to defend it and harmonize it with those cases.\nNow, I just think that's one of the places where you have a situation that tells you why you should advise confidentially to the president, because some advice about constitutionality, if it were 51-49 constitutional, this may not be the case, is that I really think this is unconstitutional, but you were wrong about that and you could later defend it, you'd have a responsibility to do so. So I would like to protect that option.\nDURBIN: If I might ask an unrelated question. If you are confirmed as attorney general of the United States of America, would you appear at Bob Jones University?\nASHCROFT: My appearances at a variety of places depend on what I think there is to be achieved and accomplished. When I get an invitation, I have to ask myself, why is this invitation here? What can I support by responding to the invitation? What will be the consequence of my response?\nI will tell you that I understand, having been a participant in these hearings and the prelude to these hearings, that the attorney general is a person who needs to exercise care--greater care, I think, than a senator does. I reject any racial intolerance or religious intolerance that has been associated with or is associated with that institution or other institutions, and I would exercise care not to send the wrong message. And I think that's the basis upon which I'd make decisions about going from one place or to another.\nDURBIN: But even in light of President-elect George Bush's letter to the late Cardinal O'Connor and the obvious embarrassment he felt when he learned of the anti-Catholic and some racial comments that were made by the leaders of that university, you would not rule out, as attorney general of the United States, appearing at that same school?\nASHCROFT: Well, let me just say this, I'll speak at places where I believe I can unite people and move them in the right direction. And my church allows women as ministers; the Catholic Church doesn't. My grandmother happened to have been an ordained minister.\nI'll go to a Catholic church and speak. It's discrimination against a woman from one perspective, but I'm not in the business of trying to find things in one faith setting that make it impossible for me to be there. I want to be there to try and promote unity.\nThere are other different faiths that have different aspects of their beliefs. I mean, some churches will forbid me to take communion. My church invites people to take communion if they feel like they want to. But I don't discriminate against going and doing things that I--if they invite me to come and do something that's helpful and therapeutic and will unite people and not divide them, I want to reserve the ability to do that.\nAnd I'm grateful for the friends who tolerate me by inviting me. Frankly, I want to focus my energy and effort to unite rather than divide and to find things of mutual respect, rather than to fine things that I can pick at or otherwise challenge.\nBut I want to make it very clear that I reject racial and religious intolerance, and I reject any current or prior policies of those. I do not endorse them by having made an appearance in any faith or any congregation. Those who prefer not to allow women in certain roles, I don't endorse that when I go there. Nor do I endorse any racial or other intolerance at other places when I make appearances.\nDURBIN: So are you equating Bob Jones with the Catholic Church, Senator?\nASHCROFT: Obviously not, and I thank you for clarifying that. Throughout this hearing you have helped me clarify things that were important.\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama?\nSESSIONS: Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that would have been better left unsaid. I don't think that was a fair summation of his remarks. We've got to treat people here with fairness, in context.\nYou take anything people say out of context, you can make people look bad.\nDURBIN: As the senator addressed that to me, I'll respond. I gave Senator Ashcroft a chance so that he would not leave that implication. I think I understood what he meant. I though that my question to Senator Ashcroft--and in his response he saw it the same way--was done as helpful to him.\nSESSIONS: Well, if that was the spirit, I'll apologize for my error.\nI do notice that, as Senator Ashcroft said some time ago, these positions of Bob Jones University, I reject categorically. I reject the anti-Catholic position of Bob Jones University categorically.\nBob Jones University is a narrow university with many views I do not agree with, not consistent with my faith. But, frankly, some good things have been happening. The ban on interracial dating as a result of this hoopla and the political visits, attention has changed. They also have softened, apparently, their statements about the Catholic Church saying they do not hate them, but love them. And so I think, maybe, these things have been healthy, maybe it's been healthy to have that. To say you'll never go somewhere I'm not sure is right.\nOn the partial birth abortion question, I think Senator Durbin opposed the vote we had, but 64 senators, as I recall, a bipartisan group, voted in favor of the partial birth abortion amendment that was in the Senate. And two-thirds of the American people favor that. Eighty-six percent, according to the April 2000 Gallop poll, oppose abortions in the third trimester, and according to a conversation I had with Senator Boxer, there may be some ways that we can develop some bipartisan progress on that.\nBut I think we need to realize that the American people are not comfortable with unlimited abortion in this country, and I, for one, do not condemn a person like Senator Ashcroft, who is troubled by the ease and the blaseness we have about this most serious matter.\nSenator Ashcroft, you talked about the role of attorney general. I served as Alabama's attorney general. Is anybody else but the attorney general that represents the state of Missouri but the attorney general?\nASHCROFT: Well, in the courts, the attorney general represents the interest of the state.\nSESSIONS: You speak for the legal interest for the state.\nASHCROFT: Yes. Now, there are some agencies that have their own counsel. But most of the time, say the Board of Healing Arts, if there's a dispute between whether doctors can prescribe medicine or some other group, the state frequently, or the position of the attorney general resolves those by attorney general's opinions, or if someone sues, the position of the board or the state is defended by the attorney general.\nSESSIONS: Well, I guess I'm--I've had personal experience with the kind of proposed consent decrees that have been talked about and you've been criticized about here today.\nIt's only the attorney general that represents the state and it's only the attorney general that can bind the state in a court of law on a consent decree. Isn't that basically correct, or have I overstated that in some fashion?\nASHCROFT: Oh, I think in general that correctly states the law.\nSESSIONS: I think that's...\nASHCROFT: But you know, it's been a while since I was attorney general.\n(CROSSTALK)\nASHCROFT: In 1984 I ceased that role.\nSESSIONS: So the point--so--well, I had this--I've been through this problem. I've been through the problem where plaintiffs sue school board, mental health system, prison system. And the people who get sued, they want more money for what they want in their programs. They want more money. So they go in and say, \"Well, let's settle and we'll have the state pay for this and get a federal judge to order us. If we can just get a federal judge to say that the mental patients' not being treated well enough, the prisoners are not being treated well enough, the school system's not being treated well enough, then we can go tell the legislators who won't give us more money that the federal court ordered it.\"\nThis is a systemic problem in America that attorney generals have to deal with. And it's difficult to go in and say no.\nI've had to do it. My predecessor agreed to a settlement I could not believe that altered the way Supreme Court justices were to be elected. And I took--when I was elected, I switched sides and reversed it in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Had I not been elected, the Alabama Constitution would have been altered because the attorney general, in my view, didn't defend the state. He did what was--perhaps people wanted, but really not that.\nBut--is my time out? I guess it is. Mr. Chairman, I apologize.\nI think there are times when an attorney general represents the state, he has an obligation and duty, regardless of what the parties to a litigation may say, to ensure that it's fair for all the people of the state. I think you did that. That's why Jay Nixon, who I knew and served with, a Democrat attorney general after you, did the same thing.\nAnd I also would note for the record that Senator Kennedy and Tom Harkin had fund-raisers for Jay Nixon while he was taking this very position.\nAnd apparently it's the problem of whether you've got a \"D\" or an \"R\" after your name, whether that's worthy of criticism.\nMy time is up.\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama is finished?\nSESSIONS: Yes.\nLEAHY: OK.\nThe distinguished senior senator from California?\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, let me just qualify Senator Durbin's question and ask it another way. You are now confirmed as attorney general. In six months, you receive an invitation from Bob Jones University. You now know about Bob Jones University. Do you accept that invitation?\nASHCROFT: Well, it depends on what the position of the university is; what the reason for the invitation is. It depends on what I might be able to achieve. They have abandoned the policy on interracial dating which was offensive. Their web site, which I wasn't aware of when I went there, if it still had the anti-Catholic aspects, I would be loath to go back.\nI would hope that they would approach things differently. And I don't want to rule out that I would ever accept any invitation there, because I think I would hope that they would make what I consider to be progress. They did when they abandoned the interracial dating ban which they had. And I would hope they would make other progress as well.\nFEINSTEIN: Do you have reason to believe that they are no longer anti-Catholic?\nASHCROFT: No, I don't know whether they are abandoning or changing or modifying their position.\nI would state this: I think it's clear. These hearings have been valuable in this respect, that I am sensitive at a higher level now than I was before, that the attorney general in particular needs to be careful about what he or she does. And I would be sensitive to accepting invitations so as to now allow a presumption to be made that I was endorsing things that would divide people instead of unite them.\nFEINSTEIN: Along those lines, let me ask you another question. You were on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Jim Hormel, a person whom I happen to know very well--he comes from my city. I've known him for many, many years--was up for ambassador to Luxembourg.\nYou voted against him at the time, saying, \"because he engaged in a gay lifestyle.\"\nMy question to you is, would someone be denied employment by you or not be selected by you for a top position in the Justice Department if they happen to employ a gay lifestyle?\nASHCROFT: No, they would not be denied. I have never used sexual orientation as a matter of qualification or disqualification in my offices. I have had individuals whose situation became apparent to me, sometimes tragically, that worked for me, and I have not made that a criterion for employment or unemployment in my office and would not do so.\nI will hire as if that is not an issue, and it is not. And whether or not the executive order would be in effect or not, that's my practice and has been in all the offices in which I have conducted myself since I got into politics, and that began in January of 1973.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you.\nIf I might ask you a question about the Hyde amendment, now law. The amendment requires states to fund abortions for women who rely on Medicaid and who choose that option if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, or if it threatens the woman's life. The amendment attempts to ensure that poor women with the consequences of rape or incest have the service and are not disadvantaged because of their economic status.\nIt's my understanding that at least two states are not in compliance with the Hyde amendment. What action, as attorney general, would you take?\nASHCROFT: First of all, I voted for the Hyde amendment on several occasions. I don't really know what enforcement actions there are, whether they're taken through the attorney general's office or whether they're taken through some other agency of the government, but I would seek to enforce the law. I'm just not sure what the enforcement action is that's appropriate in that setting.\nI don't know whether HHS has a way of dealing with that or not.\nFEINSTEIN: I wanted, for a moment, to talk about another past position and this has to do with felons obtaining weapons. The National Rifle Association has consistently supported enabling felons to restore their privilege to purchase firearms. Both through taxpayer funding for a, quote, \"relief from disability,\" end quote, program and lawsuits. Many in law enforcement have serious concerns about enabling convicted felons to possess guns.\nIn 1999, you voted for an amendment to the juvenile justice bill that would have required the FBI to create a database to identify felons who have been granted relief. Rather than establishing a national database, my question is, why don't we just prevent felons from getting guns in the first place? As attorney general, would you support felons obtaining this so-called relief from disability so they could buy guns despite their felony convictions?\nASHCROFT: Thank you, Senator. The restoration of gun rights is not a Justice Department function under the law now, it's a Treasury Department function so--and I know Senator Durbin, I think, was instrumental in--maybe I'm wrong about that, I thought you made sure that wasn't funded. Pardon me. Pardon me, it's getting late and I'm...\nFEINSTEIN: No, I understand. My question is a very simple one.\nASHCROFT: Yes, I understand that and let me address that. This is a matter of policy about which I would confer with members of the Justice Department and with also with the president of the United States in arriving at a decision.\nFEINSTEIN: My point is, I think all of law enforcement believes that felons should not possess weapons and my question to you is as attorney general do you agree with that? Would you be supportive?\nASHCROFT: Keeping guns out of the hands of felons is a top priority of mine and would be as attorney general.\nFEINSTEIN: So the answer is, yes, you would be supportive?\nASHCROFT: Yes, I think that's. Yes, it is.\nFEINSTEIN: Now, let me ask another gun question, if I may.\nLEAHY: Senator, it's time.\nFEINSTEIN: Oh, it is? I apologize. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: The senator from Kansas?\nBROWNBACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI think every question's been asked three or four, maybe five different ways so far. So the only thing I'd like to add at this point is, I'd like to submit to the record a letter received by the Judiciary Committee from Charles Evers. He's the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers. And this letter is in favor of the nominee of John Ashcroft for attorney general and strongly supports that. So I want to submit that into the record.\nLEAHY: Without objection.\nBROWNBACK: And I think that pretty well wraps up the topics.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I--if my colleague, Senator Kyl, would like, I'll yield some time.\nKYL: No, no I don't.\nMr. Chairman, might I just ask unanimous consent to insert into the record at this point an op-ed piece in the Arizona Republic today by the columnist Robert Robb on this subject.\nLEAHY: Yes. In fact, the--following the normal practice, the practice under both Senator Hatch and myself, the record will be available for senators as long as the hearing is going on, to submit statements of that nature. We have a number--several senators do and it's legitimate to do it.\nThe senator from Kansas, that good?\nBROWNBACK: That's sufficient for me.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nI would also submit questions, as we have in the past, of other senators not on the committee being able to submit questions.\nOn behalf of the two senators from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, Senator Bill Nelson, regarding the investigations into allegations of discrimination in the November 7, 2000 election in Florida, including the use of voting devices that resulted in significantly higher numbers of minority voters' ballots being thrown out. This refers to the Civil Rights Division and the Commission of Civil Rights investigation. I would submit that and will give copies to your staff and the questions for the record.\nFEINSTEIN: Mr. Chairman, may I submit some amendments--some questions to be answered in writing?\nLEAHY: Yes. And the senator from Florida--from California may, of course.\nThe--nobody else has anything to submit?\nThe senator from Washington state is...\nKENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I was wondering, Senator Biden had yielded the time--if everybody's ready, I don't want to--others have questions. But there is one. I'm wondering if I could use his time? I'll only take one minute.\nLEAHY: You want to use it now? Or do you want to...\n(OFF-MIKE)\nKENNEDY: Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Apologize.\nLEAHY: Why don't we have the senator from Washington state?\nKENNEDY: Apologize.\nLEAHY: And the senator from Massachusetts.\nAnd then, just so that people understand, once the senator from Washington state is finished and the senator from Massachusetts, using the time of the senator from Delaware, I've discussed this with the senator from Utah, we will recess for an hour to have a--we'll recess for dinner and return.\nSenator Cantwell?\nCANTWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Ashcroft, thank you for your patience and fortitude.\nHATCH: Excuse me, can I ask one question? Are we coming back to requestion on Senator Ashcroft or will that be it for the day?\nLEAHY: Well, I've got a couple questions. I mean, I'd be happy to...\nHATCH: Why don't we finish the questions...\nLEAHY: I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll stay until 6:30 and break at that time, and then, it seems like a logical time, and come back at 7:30.\nI give you my commitment, to the senator from Utah, to go late at night if need be to help get this done.\nWe can start the clock on the senator from Washington state.\nCANTWELL: Thank you.\nSenator Ashcroft, thank you for your patience and your fortitude. Yes, the hour is getting late, so I appreciate your attention to these issues.\nIf we could go back to the roadless area question that I brought up earlier, and I can go back to the record of your statement. I wasn't--since I don't have that in front of me, I'm not clear whether you said you were unfamiliar with it or unfamiliar with where it was in the Administrative Procedures Act and the rule-making authority?\nASHCROFT: Maybe I need to be refreshed, and I'm very sorry, but I don't understand what you're talking about.\nCANTWELL: The roadless area policy that has now been implemented by the Administrative Procedures Act and just completed that process--and I asked you earlier about that. And I was unclear, exactly--I wasn't clear whether--and I can go back to the record--where you say you are unclear about the policy.\nASHCROFT: It's my responsibility to defend both the laws and the rules and regulations--it's my understanding that it would be my responsibility to defend these regulations if and when they're attacked.\nBut I'm not familiar with them.\nCANTWELL: OK. Well, you sent--according to Mining Voice, you've sent a letter basically raising concern about the roadless area policy and the Clinton administration's, as you called it, \"it appears the administration has launched an orchestrated campaign to preclude mining on the vast acreages of public lands and multiple-use lands.\"\nFEINSTEIN: So, I understand you don't always remember everything that you...\nASHCROFT: I think that this maybe makes reference to what would be the situation in the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri, the old lead and zinc mines, but I shouldn't speculate, frankly. It's getting late in the day.\nFEINSTEIN: Yes.\nASHCROFT: And I don't want to do that.\nFEINSTEIN: Here's why I think it's such an important issue, because you may have, again, legislatively, which we've said--and that was numerous times today, what you've done as a senator is different as you might do as attorney general. But yet, it seems as if you raised concerns about or opposition to that policy. Now it's actually been as far, as the Administrative Procedures Act, completed. It is now law.\nIt may be that the president-elect opposes that policy. But you, as attorney general--and there are court cases already now being filed in challenge to the roadless area policy that has now been implemented by the Administrative Procedures Act, so even if the president-elect is opposed to that policy, will you, as the enforcement agency underneath your office, enforce and uphold that law and defend those cases?\nASHCROFT: I will, regardless of whether or not I supported something as a senator, defend the rule. And if it is a rule with the force and effect of law, I will defend those cases.\nFEINSTEIN: Even if the president might be seeking a new administrative overturn of that?\nASHCROFT: I think if the president wants to change the law, he has to follow the law in order to do so.\nFEINSTEIN: OK.\nASHCROFT: And I will support and enforce the law. I think that's a responsibility and I think that's what I've promised to do. I can't be result oriented; I have to be law oriented. And I think that I would disserve the president and the country were I to do otherwise.\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nSenator Kennedy, who has reserved the time of Senator Biden?\nKENNEDY: Tell my good friend, Senator Sessions, that if Jay Nixon was nominated, I'd be asking him the same questions.\nThis is just on the tobacco.\nI'd like to ask you just two quick questions.\nOne, on the issue of guns, there are three cases now--and I'll ask you the questions and perhaps you can respond to them in writing, unless you want to give an answer.\nThere are three occasions now where the gun law--that is, the Brady bill--is under a review: Case pending on the Fifth Circuit of appeals, where the defendant is challenging the conviction of weapons under the Brady bill, there's a case pending in the D.C. Circuit on the ban of assault weapons with the high-capacity ammunitions, and there's a case pending in the Sixth Circuit of appeal, which the gun lobby is again challenging the assault weapons ban.\nAnd if you're able to--if you can give us your reaction, those--I didn't tell you before that I was going to raise those. There's no reason that you ought to know about them, but if you could...\nASHCROFT: I believe these are all enactments of the Congress, signed by the president, laws of the United States that are under attack. I would expect to defend those vigorously.\nKENNEDY: Good, thank you.\nFinally, just in your May speech--this is on tobacco. In your May speech, you ridiculed the administration's effort to reduce the youth smoking, criticizing the ethic of victimology that treats tobacco as a drug and drugs as tobacco.\nIn that statement, you appeared to reject the overwhelming weight of scientific opinion that nicotine in tobacco is a highly addictive drug and reject the massive evidence that children have been the victims of a deliberate effort by the tobacco companies to addict them to smoking at a young age.\nNow, the administration has a legal action on that particular question, moving forward. It's gotten to the point where a federal judge has already examined the government--in this case, the RICO claim--and ruled that it can go forward as a matter of law. We're all aware of the mountain of evidence showing the tobacco industry did engage in unlawful acts. This is basically a recommendation of DOJ professionals.\nCan you give us any assurance about that case? Do you intend, at this time, to withdraw it? Do you intend to carry it forward? Can you give us any indication what your disposition on that would be?\nASHCROFT: Well, let me clarify that I am no friend of the tobacco industry. I don't smoke. My family doesn't smoke. I regret the fact that smoking is very dangerous to individuals.\nI have no predisposition to dismiss that suit. I would evaluate that suit, conferring with members of the Department of Justice.\nI note, and hoping to learn from it, that the attorney general two years ago said that the federal government had no independent cause of action against tobacco companies, in a statement in which I think she later reversed. And I don't want to make a statement ignorant of the kinds of facts and considerations that ought to inform my judgment when I get to the Justice Department, if I have the benefit of confirmation. I don't mean to be presumptive in my statements, but I will consider it.\nIs this the case where there were three causes of action, and two of them had been dismissed, but the RICO cause remains? I think I know in terms of the...\nKENNEDY: That's correct. And they had said that the RICO was--they said that first the defendants cannot possibly claim their alleged (inaudible) were isolated. The complaint described that--well, they've upheld that. There's three different criteria for the RICO. And I won't take the time of the committee to go through the justifications, but they have met that particular requirement. The case is moving ahead.\nYou've taken a very strong position on the whole question of substance. I doubt if there's very many medical professionals that don't believe that tobacco is a gateway drug. And, I think that there is such an extraordinary concern, parents as well as professionals, in terms of trying to make a difference, in terms particularly youth smoking, and the targeting of the companies toward youth smoking, which is really what this has been narrowed to. I would certainly hope we would get some action on it, but I appreciate your attention to it now and we'll look forward to talk about it some more.\nThank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Senator Hatch, do you have anything?\nHATCH: No, I think our side's about wrapped up. At least I hope so, and I hope yours is, too.\nLEAHY: Let me do this. I do have a couple of questions, I'll ask them and then we will break, unless somebody on your side wants to. The senator from Pennsylvania wishes to ask questions.\nI'll ask a couple, we'll go the senator from Pennsylvania so that he can ask some. We will then break. The senator from Missouri, former senator from Missouri nominee--I'm concerned about the amount of time he has to spend here. But, with all due respect, even more concerned about Mrs. Ashcroft, who's had to look at all of us.\nBut then, we've got to look at you, so we'll do my questions, we'll do the senator of Pennsylvania. We'll break. And during that time I would ask the senator from Utah if he would check on his side which, if any, senators will have questions. I'll do the same in our side.\nBob Jones University is not up for confirmation here. But just--and you've spoken of a heightened awareness on some of these things because of the confirmation hearing. And you will not be surprised to know that many nominees in both Democratic and Republican administrations have said that they became more aware of some of the issues following their confirmation hearing.\nBut just so you understand the concern, when President-elect Bush spoke at Bob Jones University about a year ago, he then expressed for the appearance in recognition of their anti-Catholic and racially divisive views. One of your Republican colleagues who received an honorary degree from Bob Jones University, Representative Asa Hutchinson, later called the school's policies indefensible.\nIn March, Bob Jones made clear on national TV that he views the pope as the antichrist and both Catholicism and Mormons as cults.\nMy suggestion--and you can do whatever you want--I made my position very clear yesterday on how I feel about you on any questions of racial or religious bias. I stated that neither I nor anybody on this committee would make that claim about you.\nBut let me say this, of your being somewhat sensitized to this. Frankly, if I were you, with all of the information that's come out--and some of which you may have known because there was a dispute with one of your own judicial nominees who disputed the question as to whether Bob Jones should have a tax exemption or not.\nBut with all that--if I could make a recommendation to you--I'd put that honorary degree in an envelope and send it back and say this is your strongest statement about what you feel about the policies.\nBut let me ask you this--I gave your staff a speech that you made in 1997 called \"On Judicial Despotism.\"\nYou characterized the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe v. Wade and Casey as illegitimate. You called the justices who struck down an Arkansas congressional term-limit law--you called them \"five ruffians in robes,\" and said that, quote, \"They stole the right of self-determination from the people.\" And you posed the rhetorical question, quote, \"Have people's lives and fortunes been relinquished to renegade judges; a rogue, contemptuous, intellectual elite fulfilling Patrick Henry's prophecy, that of turning the courts into nurseries of vice and the bane of liberty?\" And you also said, \"We should enlist the American people in an effort to reign in an out-of-control court.\"\nNow, I've disagreed with the Supreme Court decisions, and I've always emphatically stated that, while I may disagree, we have to follow them. I disagreed in Gore v. Bush. I disagreed with that, but I went over with the then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, my Republican counterpart. Went to the arguments. Came back out and said, \"We have to obey the law, whether we agree with it or not.\"\nNow, the five ruffians in robes to whom you refer are members of the Rehnquist Supreme Court. That's a conservative court. Oftentimes activist, decidedly conservative. I've heard Justice Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsberg called a number of things, but ruffians is a little bit stronger than I've had. How do you feel about that speech today?\nASHCROFT: Well, first I'd say that I have never said that people shouldn't obey their outcomes. And inasmuch as I may be spending substantial time presenting things to the court, I think I'll be respectful to the court.\nLEAHY: And would it be safe to say--I don't want to put words in, but how do you feel about your term \"ruffians in robes\"? Probably one best head for the trash can.\nASHCROFT: I don't think it'll appear in any briefs.\nLEAHY: Well, probably not on your side. You may find it quoted on the other side about you. But I think I understand your answer.\nSenator from Pennsylvania?\nSPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, we're trying to wrap up. It's late. I want to touch on a couple of areas and urge you to give consideration to them.\nOn campaign finance, there is a memorandum of understanding between the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission which I have questioned the attorney general about extensively, because there are criminal penalties, and under our law, they're to be enforced by the Department of Justice. And I would urge you to take a look at that memorandum of understanding with a view to reasserting Department of Justice authority to enforce the statutes of the United States which have a penal provisions.\nOn the issue of espionage, I would urge you to take a very close look at the procedures which are used under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to make sure that major matters don't fall between the cracks of the investigations which are of the utmost critical nature. Some of those matters have gone directly to the attorney general and have been delegated without supervision, and major investigations have been thwarted.\nWith respect to international terrorism, there have been tremendous advances made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in overseas activities, leading to some really remarkable prosecutions on extraterritorial jurisdiction, something we didn't have before 1984 and 1986 statutes were enacted. And I would urge you to take a close look there and to pursue that.\nOn the antitrust laws, I broached that very briefly and I would urge you to take a look at areas where there can be an aggressive pursuit. And with some specificity, I would call your attention to OPEC. Just in this morning's news, they're going to curtail production in order to raise prices. And there is a very solid legal theory for proceeding against OPEC under our antitrust laws, Sherman and Clayton. And an impediment had been the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which prohibits law enforcement from going after acts of state. But there is an exception if there is a commercial practice, and there is an acceptable international standard available, which there is now, with an emerging international consensus that price-fixing is unlawful.\nAnd what OPEC is doing, pure and simple, is an old-fashioned violation of the cartels in restrain of trade to keep up the prices. And Americans are being victimized there, and they really do not have sovereign immunity because of a new brand of international standard. The advances in international law are remarkable in many, many fields with the war crimes tribunal and a consensus on international law.\nAnd I mention those to you just in passing for your attention, because it's been a long day and it'd be my hope that we would move on to other witnesses, following today's termination.\nLet me ask you, as a final question, Senator Ashcroft, there have been a lot of concerns expressed--and you've heard them all; you've heard them all and then some--about many, many touchy subjects. And President-elect Bush has articulated a really desirable view of being a healer. And we talk about bipartisanship and about bringing American together, and that's going to be a very, very important item.\nAnd I believe that the assurances that you have given on many items are really important. And, if confirmed, people are going to be looking at you to see that you're going to carry them out. And I would urge you to establish a dialogue with the groups which have been identified as being opposed to you, whatever the line may be--the desegregation cases, the abortion clinics, the pro-choice issue, all of these items.\nAnd show them the man that I know from working with you for six years in the Senate, with a sense of humor and balance and realism and integrity, and very strongly held views, but a very sharp delineation between your personal philosophy and law enforcement, which we've tried to articulate and pin down--and I think you've made a lot of really important commitments.\nSo, I would ask you in a final question, what do you see that you can do in an active way to carry forward the healing that President-elect Bush talks about and give assurances on an ongoing basis to so many people who have raised these tough questions?\nASHCROFT: Well, I see the time is up.\nLet me just briefly say that...\nLEAHY: I think the senator from Pennsylvania has asked a very good question, so certainly take the time to answer.\nSPECTER: Senator Ashcroft, on time, I don't think there's any time limit on you. There are time limits on us, not on you. We've seen a lot of practices around here on 10 minutes a long speech and a question at the end of the 10 minutes. So it is a common practice for senators to take all that time, but you have the time you need.\nASHCROFT: I'm delighted to respond to the question.\nI'm very eager to be the attorney general for the people of the United States of America. I'm eager to talk to them. I'm eager for the Justice Department to have an elevated understanding by the public and standing with the public.\nI personally feel that the Justice Department has, of necessity, been, sort of, inward focused in a lot of ways recently because of circumstances that have surrounded the executive branch of government. But I think that we can invite people to participate in fashioning and shaping and understanding a Justice Department that will be seen as a Justice Department for all the people.\nI have toyed with a variety of ideas, not presuming my confirmation, but it's hard, if someone invites you to think about being the next attorney general, not to think about what you could do. And I've thought about a variety of ways to be involved with the people, with being in various cities and asking people to come and tell me what they expect from the Justice Department; being on college campuses and asking people, young people, to chat about the justice objectives for the United States of America.\nSome of you I've shared these dreams with, and I've even suggested that it would be appropriate for--in these, sort of, things outside the strict legal responsibilities we have, to participate together in. Because I think the future of America is very bright, and I would hope that we could find a way to fashion that brightness as a team effort.\nSo that I look forward to reaching out to people. I don't know that I will be as interest-group oriented; I want to reach out to people, not just interest groups. But I will not reject the opportunity for individuals who are associated with groups to be involved as well.\nBecause I think it's time for the Justice Department to be seen as an instrument of American justice for all the people, not necessarily just for the defense of the administration or the defense of the executive branch of government. And it shouldn't be something that's merely Washington-based; I think it should be something that's understood across America.\nI would plan to visit--or hope to visit early in my opportunity, if I am confirmed, virtually every jurisdiction to meet with the U.S. attorneys there.\nI want them to be inspired about what the Department of Justice does. I want them to be proud of it. I want them to have a sense that there is integrity about what we do. We will operate based on principle; the kind of principle that, more eloquently than I could state, Jack Danforth, your former colleague, spoke to you about. It's the kind of thing he established in the attorney general's office in Missouri and frankly, I followed, assiduously, that example when I was there.\nA culture that doesn't have a reference to the rule of law doesn't have freedom. And I believe freedom is the circumstance in which people flourish and individuals grow. My philosophy of government is government exists so that people grow. People reach the maximum of their potential--that's what government is about.\nAnd I'd like for the Justice Department to be a part of that. So, I intend to engage in a conversation with the American people, as aggressively as I can to help them understand the Justice Department, and to help them inform me about what they expect from the Justice Department. And that I would take those conversations to the president of the United States, with a view towards being responsive to the people of America to give them the kind of Justice Department in which they can have confidence and on which they could rely for integrity and justice.\nAnd it's a very exciting thing to me. If I am honored with the confirmation of the United States Senate, I will make it my high-intensity effort and I believe the outcome will be very, very satisfactory and pleasing. And I thank you for the question.\nLEAHY: The committee will stand recessed until 7:30. During the break, Senator Hatch will check with members on his side, I have members on my side, to see if there are further questions for the nominee or whether there are simply questions that can be submitted. You have had a long day here and I would hope that you and your staff, but especially Mrs. Ashcroft, could have some time. Thank you.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: Let me tell you where we are. During the break, as I had suggested we would do, Senator Hatch and I conferred. We have checked with the senators on both sides of the aisle. We do not have--assuming nothing unforeseen in later questions of other witnesses, we do not have other oral questions of the nominee.\nWhat we will do, because there's still some of his paperwork that has not yet come to the committee, and senators have to have a chance to see that, but also, once they've had a chance to check the transcript of yesterday and today's hearing, which was thorough, and once they've had a chance to--and once also that Senator Ashcroft has had a chance to see if he wants to make any changes in any of his answers, we have the right, both sides do, to submit further written questions to the nominee. That, of course, is the practice we've always followed with any nominee and those answers would have to come back prior to any vote.\nBut I do not intend to recall Senator Ashcroft tonight under these circumstances. We will hear from a congressional panel this evening and have questions.\nAnd, Senator Hatch?\nHATCH: Well, I'm really happy to have this, basically, over for Senator Ashcroft. I think he more than answered the questions and I think that he did a very good job.\nNow, it's my understanding, Senator, that--it's my understanding, Mr. Chairman, that we'll proceed with whoever is here tonight congressionally. But I have to take the blame, because I thought we would be going late tonight on Senator Ashcroft--which we have done--and I, basically, indicated to our witnesses that I didn't think they would need to be here, so they're not. And that's J.C. Watts and Congressman Hulshof.\nNow, I've also requested, and I respectfully request again, that since Congressman Hulshof is the prosecutor in the Johnson case, that we follow the practice--the prior practice of the committee, at least during my tenure, where you have a witness, in the case of Ronnie White, we allow Congressman Hulshof, who was the prosecutor, who wants to testify with regard to the law in that area, that we allow them to appear together, which would be the fair thing to do.\nAnd I don't think there would be any bombastingness or anything, I just think it would be good to allow the two witnesses together and it would be fair. And especially since Congressman Hulshof has requested in writing, respectfully, the privilege of doing so. If we could do that, I would feel very good about this. But if we're just going to have just one witness and then throw Hulshof, who is relevant to that witness, and Ronnie White is relevant to Hulshof...\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman?\nHATCH: Yes.\nSPECTER: I'd like to second what Senator Hatch has to say. It is frequently done--really customary, where there are two witnesses who have testimony on the same subject matter, to have them appear together. I anticipate that there may well be a difference of contention as to what the facts are. And in my tenure here, which is not as extensive as Senator Thurman's, but a while, and where I have presided at hearings, I make it a practice to bring the people in who have the same things to say.\nAnd there are frequently clashes where--for example, we had key officials of the Department of Justice and key officials of the FBI who flatly disagreed with each other. They didn't quite call each other liars, but there was, kind of, a conflict where you could follow up on questions, on factual matters, that you don't have if you have Justice White and then you have Congressman Hulshof, unless you're going to recall Justice White and we're not going to do that, so it seems to me preeminently fair.\nAnd also there's no doubt that what Justice White has to say is very germane. He's a major witness.\nHATCH: That's right.\nSPECTER: And as a matter of fairness, there ought to be an opportunity for the other side to be heard simultaneously. So I would press to have what Senator Hatch has requested be the rule.\nHATCH: If I could just add one last thing. I think, Mr. Chairman, you've conducted very fair hearings here. This is no reflection on you whatsoever, except that we believe that the only fair way to do this is to allow the two relevant witnesses on those relevant issues.\nAnd I'm not quite sure what either of them are going to say--to be able to be on the same panel. If we do it that way, it seems to me we get rid of the problem. People can ask their questions both ways if they'd like to, or not ask any questions. And it's just the fair thing to do. If we don't do it, I would think it would be pretty unfair.\nDURBIN: Mr. Chairman?\nLEAHY: Well, in--yes.\nDURBIN: Mr. Chairman, I would object to that. And I want to state my reasons for it. The difference is this: Ronnie White was rejected in his effort to be appointed to federal district court without an opportunity to ever explain his point of view. He did not receive the same fair hearing that Senator Ashcroft's received during the last two days, or that virtually every other judicial nominee receives.\nAnd I would say this, I think he is entitled to present his opinion and his decision in the context of how he saw it and how it was interpreted. You can bring in your witnesses against him, other witnesses against him, whatever you want to do. But I think he is entitled--since he was the first federal district court judge rejected on the floor of the United States Senate in 40 years, he is entitled to have his day before this committee to state his position. And we should make that a record.\nYou can put whatever rebuttal witnesses you want on--want at that point...\nLEAHY: I understand.\nDURBIN: ... Congressman Hulshof, or others. But give this man his opportunity to sit before this committee and defend himself after what he's been through.\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, may I respond? And I have great respect for Justice White, but the issue is not what happened to Justice White, the issue is what is bearing on Senator Ashcroft. And we need to have a procedure which will enable this committee to find the facts fully.\nNow I think they ought to be together. But perhaps some middle ground would be that if Justice White testifies, and then Congressman Hulshof testifies and Justice White remains so that we're able to follow up with Justice White on what Congressman Hulshof has said. That's the only way we can have any conflict, which I anticipate will be present, and to let us find the facts.\nAnd the issue is not what happened to Justice White. The issue is what is going to happen to Senator Ashcroft.\nLEAHY: Well, if I might, just so people understand, Congressman Hulshof was invited to appear with the panel tonight. He will have an opportunity to appear. I've not met Congressman Hulshof, but he was kind enough to send me a detailed letter explaining to me how to do my job, and what the Senate should do in its--in caring out its responsibility.\nThat is very helpful to the Senate, and I appreciate his giving us the benefit of his experience and wisdom from the other body, as I always have. But perhaps I'm a slow learner, that I haven't understood fully what I should do to follow his directions.\nBut in any event what I will do as chairman, I will have the congressional panel, those members who are here today, Congressman Hulshof and other members who are unable to be here tonight, will also have an opportunity to be heard. I mean I will try certainly to get them onto a panel during the time when I'm chairman. If I can't, I am sure that Senator Hatch during the time he is chairman will be able to get them on to a panel.\nThe irony is, in the question of fairness, Congressman Hulshof will get the last word, because he will be testifying after Justice White testifies. Now it may well turn out that, as a suggestion was made of having Justice White testify again, maybe for a different reason than what the senator from Pennsylvania suggested, it may be because he feels he should talk.\nBut the point is we're not talking about confirmation of Justice White, but we are talking about the confirmation process of Attorney General-nominee John Ashcroft. Now he is--he has been able to testify by himself, although we have broken into his testimony several times at the request of Senator Hatch on behalf of himself and the Bush transition team, to have a long series of senators to come and speak on his behalf. We did that again today.\nIt's been somewhat unprecedented. We've had a senator from Texas, a senator from Maine, a former senator from Missouri. I intend though, out of courtesy to the nominee, did not bring--while he was here, did not bring another former senator from Missouri, who is opposed to his nomination; I did not bring other members of Congress who are opposed to his nomination to come in during that time.\nHe was allowed to interrupt any time Senator Hatch told me he wanted to, to bring in people to speak on his behalf, sit with him at the witness table and do it.\nBut just so we are not here all night long talking about what's going to happen, we'll go ahead and put into the record the kind letter from Congressman Hulshof explaining how I should do my job. I appreciate it, of course. I'm always open to suggestions and trust me, I get a lot of them; 17,000 e-mails in one day this week. And we'll go ahead with our panel.\nSPECTER: Mr. Chairman, did you say you were putting the letter in the record?\nLEAHY: Yes.\nSPECTER: OK, because I think that's important because this letter does not do what you said. This letter does not tell you how to do your job, and I think it's a disservice to Congressman Hulshof for you to make that statement. It certainly doesn't do that and I want to read the letter.\nLEAHY: Well, the letter was given to the press. I heard about it after he gave it to the press.\nSPECTER: I think I have the floor, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to read the letter because Congressman Hulshof's entitled to not be characterized as doing something that's taking on the business of the Senate.\nThis is what he says: \"Dear Senator Leahy, as a matter of personal privilege, I respectfully request that I be allowed to testify on the same witness panel as Judge Ronnie White during your confirmation hearings on the nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be United States attorney general.\n\"My appearance before the Judiciary Committee does not come becomes I am a sitting member of the U.S. House; my appearance is solely because I was co-counsel in the prosecution of a murder case which became a critical issue during the consideration of Judge White's nomination to the federal bench. I believe I can provide significant and unique testimony relevant to the State of Missouri v. James Johnson and Judge White's expected testimony.\n\"Your current invitation to have me testify as part of a panel consisting of interested members of Congress will not provide the Judiciary Committee with the full, fair and accurate account of the James Johnson case. I respectfully request that my appearance occur on the same panel as Judge White; any other invitation would reflect a politization of the hearing process. It would be unfair to the Senate, the incoming administration, the American people. Sincerely, Kenny Hulshof.\"\nNow, I believe that's very respectful. But if we're to have a process where these witnesses are not going to testify together and it comes down to the raw power of the chairman, then my suggestion would be to the incoming chairman that we reconvene the hearing on the afternoon of January 20 or Monday, January the 22nd, and call the two witnesses.\nLEAHY: Well, the incoming chairman, of course, would have that opportunity...\nHATCH: Well, I do not intend to do that. Let me bring this to closure.\n(CROSSTALK)\nHATCH: Let me just bring this to closure, because we have to go to our next witnesses.\n(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, I still haven't been recognized on this point either, and I would like to be, as a member of the committee.\nHATCH: Well, let me just say this, and then of course I'll step aside. Both Justice White and Congressman Hulshof are fact witnesses to the Ashcroft nomination. They're not appearing in their official capacities. All I'm asking is for basic fairness.\nNow, the chairman can do whatever the chairman wants to do. I'm not trying to embarrass him. I just feel deeply about this.\nAnd I think I have the reputation, over the last six years that I've been chairman of this committee before now, of allowing the minority to present opposition witnesses. I don't think that's an untoward request. And what it looks like is is that if you just have Justice White and no opposition witnesses who's a fact witness who is relevant to this on the same panel, then basically it just looks like you're setting aside one person and giving that person a single panel without any opposition; and then throwing a congressman in the mix with a bunch of very important, but other witnesses, who aren't at all concerned--or should I say aren't at all fact witnesses with regard to the issue in question.\nSo I just respectfully ask the chairman to think it over, and I hope that you will do that...\nLEAHY: Well, that...\nHATCH: ... because I think it's the right thing to do.\nLEAHY: What this tends to ignore, though, is the fact that, because Congressman Hulshof was not here this evening, as we'd expected, and several other members...\nHATCH: Well, neither is Justice White.\nLEAHY: ... and some of our other members of that panel are not here this evening, he actually has an advantage that everybody seems to be overlooking: He gets to appear after Justice White; he gets the last word.\nSPECTER: But if we're to have a process where these witnesses are not going to testify together and it comes down to the raw power of the chairman, then my suggestion would be to the incoming chairman that we reconvene the hearing on the afternoon of January 20 or Monday, January the 22nd, and call the two witnesses.\nLEAHY: Well, the incoming chairman, of course, would have that opportunity...\nHATCH: Well, I do not intend to do that.

Let me--and I'm going to...\nHATCH: Will he be on his own panel?\nLEAHY: I'm going to recognize--well, if you want to have him next Monday, you can. I'm going to recognize--or you can have him Saturday afternoon as--frankly, I'm...\nHATCH: I'm asking for fairness. I'm not asking for anything else.\nLEAHY: Unlike...\nHATCH: And if you don't want to do it, you're chairman and we'll live with it.\nLEAHY: Thank you. Orrin...\nHATCH: But I'm telling you, if you--and we'll put him on afterwards. But make him solely on the table then, just like Justice White.\nLEAHY: Orrin, Orrin, you can do whatever you want. Now, the senator from--and we don't need the histrionics.\nBut the senator from Pennsylvania--the senator from Pennsylvania suggested Saturday afternoon. I, like a loyal American, U.S. senator, will be at George Bush's inauguration Saturday afternoon. But you know, you do what you want.\nLet me--and I'm going to recognize the senator from Arizona first. But let me call to the table so we can at least try to get started--you are, after all, the one who asked me to move along here--Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\nWould you please come up and take your places?\nAnd I yield to, first, the senator from Arizona.\nKYL: Thank you.\nMr. Chairman, for six years I have been a subcommittee chairman of this committee. And I've held numerous hearings in which we created panels. And I've been told in every instance where we had a witness on one side that, of course, we had to accord the minority the right to have a witness on the same panel to deal with the same issue.\nI inquired as to whether that was a rule. And I was informed, no, it's not a rule, but it is a long-standing tradition and practice of the committee. Because, of course, it represents the rule of fairness that where you have a particular issue involved, it is fair for the minority to have a witness on the same panel as the majority.\nI would urge the chairman to think this over as well, because the chairman will be setting, I think, a very--if I could have the chairman's attention on this, because I'm actually speaking to you, Mr. Chairman. I don't want to be unkind here.\nI would urge the chairman to think this over carefully, because the chairman would be setting a precedent here. We're going to be in the majority, at least for a while, starting next Monday. And we would then have the right, under the last action of this chairman, under the precedent that he set, to deny the minority the right to have members or witnesses on panels that we create. I don't think that's a very good precedent.\nI think we should stick with the precedent of the committee. It's long-standing. It's traditional. It's fair. And it's pretty obvious, I think, what the effect of having just one witness on this panel would be, especially if it were not immediately followed by our witness dealing with the same subject, which as I understand it is not the chairman's intention.\nSo, while up to now I would consider this process very fair, I think it would be eminently unfair to proceed as the chairman suggests, but worse would create a precedent that, unfortunately, would provide the temptation to those in charge from thereafter to simply do what they wanted, irrespective of the interest of the minority.\nSo, I would urge the chairman to think this over this evening.\nLEAHY: I appreciate that. The precedent, of course, already exists--certainly has in the 26 years I've been here, three times the majority, twice the minority, and I've seen the precedent many times.\nIf Congressman Hulshof is that concerned about a hearing with his colleagues from the House, then we can arrange a time...\nKYL: That's not what we're asking for.\nLEAHY: We can arrange a time for him to appear by himself so that he'd have the same treatment that Justice White is having. But I told all of you I would try to move these things forward. Let Senator Hatch and I talk about that. Let's start with the witnesses who are here today.\nHATCH: Let me just make one last comment. Regardless of what your decision is here today, should I become chairman of this committee, I'm going to practice what I've always practiced, and that is that if the minority has an off-setting witness, they're going to be able to call that witness. And I don't care what your decision is, that's what I'm going to do.\nBut I asked my colleague--and we've gotten along very well and, frankly, I think you've done a very good job in these hearings. I'm hopeful that you'll think this over and I would even agree: Let Justice White go first if you want and then call Ken Hulshof--Congressman Hulshof by himself immediately afterwards. And then if Justice White doesn't like what he says, you can bring him back; that would be fine with me. But I'd like to have this resolved because it's only fair. If it wasn't fair, that's another matter, but it's so clear on its face that it's fair.\nBut just to make the record clear, should I become chairman, the minority will have a right that I hope we will not be barred from having as a minority here, and I will just treat it that way. So we'll leave it at that. That's all I can do.\nLEAHY: The senator of Utah knows I have stopped this hearing several times to bring in witnesses that I had not been told we were going to have until the very last second. I have accommodated him. I have put them in. I've been trying to accommodate everybody there. We could have had a whole another round at his request and on behalf of Senator Ashcroft, though, we won't go into our full private conversation, I worked at having senators who might have wanted to do it--ask further questions not to do it.\nCongresswoman Waters?\nU.S. REPRESENTATIVE MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you this evening.\nI respect the tremendous responsibility that you have in a matter such as this. It is very serious, and I know that you will do the very best job that you can. I'm here because this issue, this confirmation is extremely important to me and to people that I represent.\nI have listened very carefully to Senator John Ashcroft yesterday and today. It is clear to me that John Ashcroft is attempting to deny the passion and poor judgment he has displayed on certain critical issues, such as abortion, guns, civil rights and voter rights. He would have us believe that, despite his extreme positions, we should trust him to be the attorney general of the United States of America, with the responsibility for enforcing the nation's laws.\nI hate to say this, members, but I must share with you, I simply do not trust John Ashcroft. I believe he is simply saying whatever he believes is necessary to be confirmed. John Ashcroft has a record of opposing minorities nominated to key positions by President Bill Clinton, such as Bill Lann Lee, David Satcher, Judge Ronnie White.\nAnd it was his unprincipled attack on Judge White that really caught my attention. Ronnie White had bipartisan support during the Judiciary Committee hearing. He was also supported by Kit Bond, the other United States senator from Missouri. John Ashcroft used Ronnie White as a pawn in his re-election campaign. He manufactured an argument that Ronnie White was soft on crime.\nAfter Ronnie White's confirmation had been voted out of committee, John Ashcroft organized fringe police groups to oppose the confirmation. John Ashcroft then recruited Kit Bond and other Republicans to vote against Judge White on the Senate floor.\nRonnie White's career has been seriously damaged by an unusual party-line vote simply because John Ashcroft misrepresented this African-American man as a poster boy for \"soft on crime,\" and portrayed Judge White as being too liberal and too dangerous to be entrusted with a lifetime tenure to the federal bench.\nAll this was a shameless, cheap political sabotage of a fine judge who had worked his way out of poverty to obtain an education and serve his country and his state.\nWhat John Ashcroft did was not honest. He knowingly distorted Ronnie White's record and misrepresented decisions Judge White had made, twisting and distorting his judicial record.\nJohn Ashcroft's position on abortion is extreme. He rabidly opposes a woman's freedom of choice even in cases of incest and rape. In addition, information disclosed by Senator Kennedy during this hearing today documented the actions John Ashcroft took to thwart voter registration by the people of St. Louis, particularly the black, the poor and the disadvantaged. These revelations are startling and unsettling.\nI am particularly concerned about his record in Missouri because I was born in Missouri, attended those segregated schools in St. Louis, Missouri, and I witnessed poverty and exclusion of African-Americans in that city. We had a rough time growing up in St. Louis, Missouri. And I was in St. Louis four years ago during an election where there was disenfranchisement and I called the Justice Department from there.\nI know that people like John Ashcroft--now I know that people like him are responsible for dashing the hopes and dreams of poor people and African-Americans because of the kinds of decisions they make in their role as public policy-makers.\nWe've heard no reasonable explanation from John Ashcroft about his obstruction of efforts to educate and train voting registrars from St. Louis. When these disclosures are added to his attempts to block desegregation programs in Missouri, we are left with a nominee who should not and must not be confirmed.\nI would be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nLEAHY: I should point out also Congressman Waters has been here a great deal and I know that Congresswoman Jackson Lee has been present throughout these hearings; is probably as weary as the rest of us. But the senator from Utah and I see her often on the House Judiciary Committee and she's a respected member of that.\nAnd I'm glad to have you here. Congresswoman, go ahead.\nU.S. REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Might I add my appreciation for the fair and impartial way in which you have conducted these hearings.\nAnd to Mr. Hatch, the ranking member, let me thank you as well for your graciousness and those of the members--the members who have here, Senator Durbin, and, of course, the members who are here as well that were kind enough to allow us to participate this evening.\nIf I might--to capture the essence of the nature of concern that many of us have with respect to the nomination of Senator Ashcroft, I think it goes to a statement made by Dr. Martin Luther King in 1962. \"It may be true that law can't make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me.\"\nCertainly, many of us in the 21st century would like to think that those kinds of travesties are behind us. And if I was here to contest Senator Ashcroft's conservative views, I would be hypocritical. If I was here to contest his religious vigor, I'd be likewise hypocritical. For our democracy allows us to hold a number of different and diverse beliefs, and I am proud of the fact that we live in a democratic society that gives us that privilege.\nBut I do want to say to this committee that I am a product of a segregated America. I know what it is to be bused to a school to integrate that school. I've lived with people who, in varying ways, have either been hurt or harmed or felt intimidated because of the color of their skin, because someone treated them differently. I had, maybe, the privilege to understand what it's like to ride in the back of a train with a brown paper bag with food because I could not go to the car where food was served.\nThis is an emotional and passionate time for many of us. And we thought that as we crossed the bridge into the 21st century, we might have a time we might not have to look upon those times in our lives when we were treated so differently and distinct and others took it lightly that we should even be concerned.\nSo the reason I am here as a member of the House Judiciary Committee and representing constituents from a southern state, the state of Texas, that itself has faced the challenge of integration over segregation, is to tell you that what bothers me and bothers my constituents is what has been shown in Senator Ashcroft's record.\nChairman Leahy, I have spent time in this hearing room and I've heard a man say quite differently, quite in contrast to his record. He speaks eloquently now about Roe v. Wade, but I know, as a young woman growing up, what it meant now to have the protection of the law; women who lost their lives in back-room alley abortions. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, but it is a life-and-death issue.\nI also understand very well this whole question of discrimination, because I am a product of watching Martin Luther King be assassinated, and I take very seriously his day of honor, January 15, the day we honor him as we honored him this week. Many of us still cry when we hear the words, \"We shall overcome.\"\nAnd so I come again, I hope not in the viewpoint of being in opposition to an American who has presented himself to this country for service, nor particularly in opposition to the president's right to choose his Cabinet. I would say to President-elect Bush that I was taught to believe a person's word, and I do believe he indicated that he would seek to find ways of healing this nation and bringing us together.\nI do believe when you reject people because they are different, such as Ambassador Hormel, that you do raise the question of whether you can accept in your spirit, in your heart and in the practice of law, the fact that we are all created equal.\nCharlene Hunter, the Little Rock Nine and James Meredith represent the names that we somewhat identify with kicking open the doors of opportunity, quality in higher education. It doesn't seem right that just about 20 years ago, Attorney General Ashcroft was in the middle of denying equal opportunity to education. It seems that is was something that did not really have to be done, which is one of the reasons that I come before you.\nJohn Ashcroft, as attorney general and as governor of the state of Missouri, consistently opposed efforts to desegregate schools in Missouri, which, for more than 150 years, had legally sanctioned separate and inferior education for blacks.\nLet me cite for you a report, the Woodstock (ph) report, that talks about the fact that we have not overcome in desegregating our schools. As recently as 1993, it said, \"while there has been significantly an amount of success in school desegregation over the last 25 years, in general segregation has not decreased significantly. Since 1970, in fact, in some areas it has gotten worse. Today, 22 or 23 of the 25 largest central-city school districts in this nation are predominantly minority.\"\nWhat that means to this committee is that, yes, an attorney general of this vintage, of this era, of this millennium will still have issues of how do we desegregate.\nMissouri had a long and marked historically of systematically discriminating against African-Americans in the provision of public education. And during 45 years of slavery, the state forbid the education of blacks. After the Civil War, Missouri was the most northern state to have a constitutional mandate requiring separate schools for blacks and whites.\nThis constitutional provision remained in place until 1976. For much of its history, Missouri provided vastly inferior services to black students.\nAfter the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, the Missouri Attorney General's Office, rather than ordering the dismantling of segregation, simply issued an opinion that local districts may permit white and colored children to attend the same schools and could decide for themselves whether they must integrate. Local schools in St. Louis and Kansas City perpetrated segregation by manipulating attendance boundaries, drawing discriminatory busing plans and building new schools in places to keep races apart.\nThe St. Louis case that is relevant in this proceeding over these next days was filed in 1972. St. Louis had adhered to an explicit system of racial segregation throughout the 1960s. It took a long time. White students were assigned to schools in their neighborhood, black students to black schools in the core of the city, black students who resided outside the city were bused into black schools in the city. The city had launched no effort to integrate, it simply adopted neighborhood school assignment plans that maintained racial segregation.\nThere was a need for healing, there was a need for leadership, there was a need to get outside of the box of the representation that the senator made that he was only representing the state.\nIn 1972, Minnie LaDell (ph) and a group of black students filed a class action lawsuit against St. Louis City Board of Education. And contrary to the senator's testimony, the state was made a party to this action, and the 8th Circuit ultimately found that the state and the city school board were responsible for maintaining school segregation for many years following Brown and that they acted in violation of the constitutional rights of the plaintiff school children. With this ruling the, 8th Circuit ordered that a desegregation plan be revised.\nAnd in 1980, the parent and student plaintiffs, along with the city board, amended complaints seeking a metropolitan school desegregation remedy. They did it voluntarily. They worked together. Subsequently, the district court announced a voluntarily inter-district desegregation plan and added that the 22nd St. Louis County School Districts as defendants--or added them as defendants.\nSenator Ashcroft, then attorney general, challenged the desegregation plan. He argued that there was no basis for holding the state liable and that the state had taken the necessary and appropriate steps to remove the legal underpinnings of the segregated schooling as well as affirmatively prohibiting such discrimination. The courts rejected the attempts, they characterized his acts as dilatory.\nIn 1983, the city school board and the 22 suburban districts all agreed to unique and comprehensive settlement, implementing a voluntary five-year school desegregation plan for both the city and the county. Importantly, the plan was voluntary. It relied on voluntary transfers by students rather than so-called forced busing. The district court approved the plan. And, again, Attorney General Ashcroft, representing the state, was the only one that did not join the settlement. He opposed all aspects of the settlement. In fact, he sought to have it overturned.\nThe 8th Circuit upheld, however, most of the provision of the plan and emphasized that three times over the prior three years it had specifically held that the state was the primary constitutional violator. Not satisfied then, Senator Ashcroft sought review in the Supreme Court and was denied his request. And even after his unsuccessful appeal, Senator Ashcroft continued to obstruct the operation of the settlement, leading the district court to conclude, \"If it were not for the state of Missouri and its feckless appeals perhaps none of us would be here at this time.\"\nAnd when he became governor, Governor Ashcroft continued to obstruct the desegregation plan of the state's educational institutions well into the 1990s.\nJudge Stephen Limbaugh, who was appointed by President Reagan, actually stated that the state was ignoring the real objections of this case: a better education for city students in public schools.\nMight I say to you this: I wanted to chronicle the history of this desegregation order and plan, not because this committee is not brilliant in its own way, and secured its own information, but I personally needed to add to you a very disheartened voice. I don't know how long I can continue, maybe, without feeling real deep pain.\nI would hope that Senator Ashcroft's representation before this committee were absolutely true, that he could vigorously defend the laws, whether it's Roe v. Wade, affirmative action as it is in the federal law--mend it; don't end it--it still exists, the Voters' Rights Act of 1965, which has to be reauthorized.\nBut there is another key element to being the attorney general of the United States of America. It is the perception that vulnerable people have about what the federal government does and I am reminded of what happened in Little Rock. They called President Eisenhower. They called President Kennedy. They called President Lyndon Baines Johnson. And the men that had to act at that time, since it was not women, were the attorney generals of the United States of America.\nAnd when they acted, they acted sometimes out of the realm--not out of the rule of law, but out of the realm of what was popular or what was standard or what was the basis, or maybe what was even centennial law, in order to ensure that vulnerable people were protected. Every single day, more so than Health and Human Services or Commerce, more so than the secretary of state, the Department of Justice is called upon to work for the vulnerable--Alabama, Ohio, Utah, Vermont, Illinois, California, Texas and elsewhere.\nWhat disturbs me, Mr. Chairman, and why I ask this committee to consider the record of Senator Ashcroft, is the fact of whether or not he can be the protector that needs to be for the people of the United States.\nI will close by simply saying this. I know that Judge White will present himself tomorrow. I, however, believe, that temperament of words is a key element as well. All of us will live by what we say. And I believe that words that would suggest a jurist has a pro-criminal bent based upon one case or cases that are a bare minimum, if you will, of the cases that he decided, shows some question of an individual's temperament for protecting the vulnerable.\nI thank the committee for their kindness and the opportunity to make my testimony this evening.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much, both Congresswoman Waters and Congresswoman Jackson Lee.\nI think that testimony is extremely important. And I can't begin to summarize either the eloquence or depth of your statement. Let me touch both of you on three points.\nThere is discussion of Roe v. Wade. I remember the days of the back-alley abortionists. I prosecuted one of the worst people I ever knew. We first found out about what he was doing when I was called to the emergency room of our local hospital. The young woman, in her teens, college student, in the area of school, nearly died of a botched abortion. She lived; sterile as a result.\nThis particular person who I then prosecuted that was doing this, we found that he had arranged this back-room program. He would bring young, pregnant women to Montreal. Abortions would be conducted by a woman who learned how to conduct abortions by working for the SS at Auschwitz. He would then blackmail these women for money or for sex.\nNow, I was a young prosecutor, father of three children, in my 20s. I prosecuted him. I convicted him. But I went a step further. I arranged a case which became Beecham v. Leahy in Vermont. It was a precursor of Roe v. Wade. And basically, Vermont took the same position as Roe v. Wade, and said that abortions--under appropriate medical circumstances, all would be legal.\nI'd already arranged that in our county, because I made it very clear that there would not be prosecutions within the hospital area. It's now the law in Vermont anyway. Now, of course, it was case law, now it's statutory law. So I understand that.\nYou've spoken of Justice White. And I understand how easy it is to condemn a judge who usually cannot respond. But I know--and I've spoken about this on the floor of the Senate--how terrible it is when that condemnation because one disagrees with a judge who said, not that, \"I want to release a person who'd been charged with a heinous crime, and by all accounts was guilty of a heinous crime.\" He never said, \"I want to release him.\" He said, \"I want to make sure he's guaranteed a fair trial.\"\nI mean, to condemn him for that is almost like condemning an attorney who is assigned to represent a criminal. They're fulfilling and upholding our Constitution to do so.\nNow, some may agree or disagree in the law that he applied. But what he was saying is not release a criminal, but guarantee that all of us have a fair trial, because that guarantees that the guilty are punished, the innocent remain free.\nNow, how anybody could condemn that--and I was both a defense attorney and a prosecutor--I don't know.\nHe's been labeled a number of things. He voted to uphold convictions 95 percent of the times that the justices of the Missouri Supreme Court appointed by then-Governor Ashcroft. So I understand that.\nOne area that you've experienced, though, both of you, and I've known you both for years, that really touches me that I can't know--I come from a state which is 98, 99 percent, I haven't got the latest census records, white. I think probably when we talk about ethnic groups, minority groups in Vermont, we're talking about recent immigrants to our state either from Canada or other countries, like my grandparents or my parents-in-law.\nThe relationships between whites and blacks, I've learned in my years of going to law school here, or on the first trip that I made as an 18-year-old, which would be 1958, to Washington with my parents sightseeing, and seeing segregated water fountains, inconceivable in our state of Vermont--I mean, we wouldn't know what you do with them--seeing that here in Washington, D.C., the capital.\nNow, what I have learned, though, in my years here, I think a depth of the feeling, feeling that you've expressed far more eloquently than I ever could. And what I have learned is that all of us, white, black or whatever, who serve in positions of trust in the government of this country, or the government of our state, have a responsibility to everybody. That's not just to say, \"I have no bias, I have no prejudice or anything else,\" but to make sure you take the steps necessary to demonstrate that it is an inclusive, not an exclusive society, a society I want for my children and grandchildren; I want to be inclusive, not exclusive.\nWe're a nation of 280 million Americans.\nIt's our inclusiveness that makes us strong. It's our exclusiveness that shatters us and makes us weak.\nNow there are only 100 of us who can vote on a question of a presidential nomination. When we vote, we have to ask do we include or do we exclude?\nThe senator from Utah?\nHATCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I won't keep you long.\nI want to express my gratitude to both of you for being here today, and being here this late this evening, and for the eloquent statements that you've made.\nI'll just say this. I was raised in poverty and I learned a trade as a young man. I was fortunate enough because my father was a skilled tradesman and I was able to join the union. And we had three African-American latherers in our local and they always got the worst work there was. And I worked with them, not very much, but I was one of the few who did and I was proud to do it.\nAnd that meant, on one occasion, if I can remember it correctly, climbing with about a 65-pound toolbox on one arm, straight up five floors up to about the 15th floor of a building one rung at a time, and then putting floor lath down, which was the most back-breaking work there was, which is what they were given. So I sense very strongly and feel very deeply about your feelings.\nNow I also know Senator Ashcroft very well, and I believe, having watched him very closely, that when he says he'll do something, he will do it. He's a religious man. He's a very good man. He's had 30 years in public policy--at least 27 to 28 years--I guess I'd say about 30 years. And I'm sure anybody who's been in public work for that long is going to have a record that can be condemned from time to time by somebody. But everybody here knows he's a man of integrity and when he says he'll do something, I think he will.\nBut I just wanted to make that point. I don't want to prolong this.\nI want to thank you both for being here. Respect both of you, as you know. And I'm grateful that you could be here and express your particular points of view.\nLEAHY: Senator Durbin?\nDURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd to my two friends and former colleagues from the House, thank you for your patience. I've watched you all day, sitting there listening as we've gone through this committee hearing. And it says a lot about your commitment to this issue and this nomination that you would wait here for this opportunity to speak.\nAnd Congresswoman Waters, I grew up across the river in East St. Louis. And so we come from similar backgrounds.\nAnd Congresswoman Jackson Lee, thank you too for being here.\nI'm a product of the '60s. I naively believed, as a college student, that if we could pass those civil rights laws that my children wouldn't even understand what racism was all about, wouldn't understand what prejudice meant. I'd have to sit down and explain that's the way it used to be. Things have gotten better, and thank goodness for that.\nBut I've come to understand that it just isn't the law that makes it better. You need a government that believes in that law, that enforces that law and implements that law. And doesn't just do it out of duty, but does it out of a heartfelt commitment that government is not an abstract unit, that government consists of people.\nAnd the reason why this committee, this Judiciary Committee, seems to struggle with the question of race so frequently is because the Department of Justice is really the place we turn to when it comes to civil rights. We want to know that whoever is heading that department not only understands the law and their legal obligation, but has a commitment in their heart to make sure that it works.\nI have not accused Senator Ashcroft of racial prejudice, nor will I. I don't believe that's appropriate. But I do question some of the decisions which he's made, which have raised questions in the minds of people who wonder if he has that heartfelt commitment.\nWhat happened to Justice Ronnie White should never happen to anyone. To be pilloried on the floor of the United States Senate at being pro-criminal after what that man has gone through in his life and his professional background, that's why I believe it's appropriate for him to sit in that chair tomorrow, by himself, with that microphone and defend himself; for the first time in over a year to have a chance to tell his side of the story.\nThe rebuttal witnesses will have their time, too. But he deserves that respect.\nAnd I said it to Senator Ashcroft today, and I will repeat it: I believe what happened to him was disgraceful and I don't believe the facts back it up. And if Senator Ashcroft disagreed with one decision or another, that's not enough to reject a man who had waited over two for that opportunity.\nCongresswoman Jackson Lee, that school desegregation story, that Senator Kennedy has returned to time and time again, is an important one and it's I think, especially important to note that we are talking about a voluntary desegregation plan. The people in St. Louis came together and said, \"Put the judges aside for a minute; let's let the parents and teachers and administrators and interested citizens find a solution for our community,\" and consistently ran into opposition from Senator Ashcroft in his official public positions.\nThat's what causes some concern and questions as to whether he has the heartfelt commitment to make sure that the laws are implemented well.\nThank you both for being here. Your testimony makes a big difference.\nLEAHY: The senator from Pennsylvania?\nSPECTER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nJust a word or two. Thank you for coming. Thank you for staying. We're in the 11th hour of this hearing today. At 10 a.m., we're standing room only. Now there are plenty of seats if anybody wants to come and see the hearing--easy access to the Russell Senate Office Building.\nI appreciate what you congresswomen have had to say. You're both very vigorous advocates. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is outspoken. She's outspoken me on a number of occasions when we've been on shows together.\nAnd with Congresswoman Maxine Waters, just a very short story. I chaired the Intelligence Committee a few years back and we were having a hearing on whether the CIA was selling narcotics in Los Angeles to finance the Contras. And Congresswoman Waters came in to quietly raise a point or two, and I invited her to sit on the panel, made her a part of the Senate panel. I demoted you for a day, Congresswoman Waters.\nAnd I understand your concerns about civil rights, about the issues you've raised and I won't detail why I understand them, but I do and I don't have to talk about a record here.\nWe all can't agree on everything. And my vantage point of Senator Ashcroft's a little different, having worked with him very closely and he's answered a lot of very pointed questions, and there'll be a lot of congressional, senatorial oversight.\nBut, you're a couple of fighters and I have great respect for you. Thank you.\nLEAHY: I thank the senator from Pennsylvania.\nThe senior senator from New York?\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me join all of my colleagues here in the Senate in thanking the two Congressmembers, not only for their testimony but for their diligence and patience. They're both former colleagues of mine and we both work together, Maxine and I on the Banking Committee, and Sheila and I on the Judiciary Committee, and we had a lot of good times over there.\nLet me ask just one question here--and I agree with Senator Durbin and all my colleagues: I do not believe that Senator Ashcroft is a racist. I believe that he has appointed people of color to high office. And I think those of us who are on the more liberal side of the spectrum shouldn't demand that diversity means ideological similarity.\nWhat troubles me here is a certain insensitivity, I guess I would say, to the long and tortured history of race as a problem in America. And that to me, that insensitivity deals with the always present, or often present, double standard. In other words, the way I would look at something is, I would try, and I think we all should try, to be very careful when you are opposing a black person for an office, you ought to make sure that you've imposed the same standard on everybody else. And you wouldn't normally have to do that if we didn't have a history of racism, and if we didn't have a history of racial division, then you would just say, \"Let's look at the merits,\" and go for it.\nAnd certainly, my views on crime issues and the views of both of you are not quite the same, as we learned during the crime bill. But that, to me, is not the issue. It's not a question of whether Judge White was soft on crime. Senator Ashcroft could well believe in good conscious that he was. The question is, did Senator Ashcroft apply the same standard to Judge White's, quote, \"soft on crime\" stance, that he applied to other judges?\nI can't remember the numbers in his testimony, but he voted to approve something like, I don't know, 210 out of the 240 judicial appointments that President Clinton put together.\nMy guess is--I have not researched this, although I hope by tomorrow morning I will--that a good number of--or some number of the judges that Senator Ashcroft voted for were probably more liberal on crime issues than Judge White. That is the troublesome thing here. I think, as a senator, as an American, and certainly as an attorney general, we need somebody who's going to be sensitive to that issue; that because a double standard has existed in America for so long--we've made progress in eradicating that standard over the last 30 or 40 years, but it's still there all too often--that one has to be sensitive to that. And the job of attorney general demands particular sensitivity.\nI understand there was a political campaign going on, and I understand that when you get down to the wire there are lots of things any human being, all of us included, might do. But I think there are certain areas off-limits, and one of them is not being sensitive to that double standard, because double standards have been so poisonous to America for our history.\nAnd I just wonder if either of you would like to comment on that concept.\nWATERS: I certainly would like to comment on that concept, Senator.\nI want to try and share something with you that may help you to understand our very, very deep feelings about something like this.\nFirst of all, let me just say this. Having been reared in St. Louis, Missouri, where there was a lot of poverty and segregated schools and parents who were striving very hard to give their children a chance, and I mean it was rough, just as Judge Ronnie White describes how he used to clean up, worked as a janitor as a kid in the White Castle stores, we started working when we were 11 and 12 years old.\nWe didn't work for extra money. We worked because if we didn't work, we wouldn't have any clothes to go to school with. And during the summertime we took jobs in segregated restaurants. I worked in Thompson's (ph) where black people couldn't eat. And at lunch time we could not eat in the restaurant. We had to eat in the basement.\nWe did that because we had to have clothes to go back to school in September. All of the kids in our neighborhood starting working at a very early age and many of us not only bought clothes, but the dollars that we earned helped to feed the other kids.\nThere was no birth control. My mother had 13 children. She had a fourth-grade education. And she worked on the polls. She didn't know a lot. She could not help a lot of the people who wanted to vote. That's why this business about excluding St. Louis in the voter registration training of registrars, kind of, strikes at me. I watched her work on the polls and do the best that she could. She believed in voting. And a lot of people in our neighborhood did not believe in voting.\nAnd so when you talk about these things, we are not relating to them in abstract. It touches us very, very deeply and it hurts.\nNow, when you talk about the insensitivity, it could be described as that. But, you know, there's something called a thousand nicks.\nLEAHY: Called a what?\nWATERS: A thousand nicks. They add up. And when the nicks continue over a period of time, then you define yourself. You define yourself in ways that many of us, who have had to be on the lookout all of our lives for the obstacles, how to get around them, how to keep people from limiting our opportunity, we know it when we see it and he fits the description.\nAnd I want to tell you that the insensitivity that you describe is even deeper than that, because to be an African-American man, who's had to struggle through poverty and struggle through all that he had to go through with, knowing that you have to be better than most in order to get something like an appointment to the federal bench--there are not many of us who get appointments like that--and you work your way up.\nAnd you work hard, you play by the rules. You do everything that you possibly can. And you get the support in the Judiciary Committee, bipartisan support. And you have a lot of supporters with you. Only to be stopped on the floor in an unusual and extraordinary way, is beyond insensitivity.\nYou cannot fall back and describe yourself as being a person of high moral character and a person deeply steeped in religion. We know something about religion, too. And it teaches us to be better than that.\nYou don't destroy human beings simply because you have the power to do it. You help people. You don't take this vulnerable African-American man, who's worked all of his life against the odds to get to a place where most of us will never get, and sandbag him because, all of a sudden, you've got an election, and he becomes the poster boy for your election. And you can only be appealing to a certain element in our society with that kind of argument.\nIt's beyond sensitivity, Senator. And I want you to know, that that's when he really caught my attention. And I want to tell you, he could sit here and he could say to us over and over again, \"Well, I did that then, but I'm going to be better. Yes, I know I've been passionate on this, but I'm going to enforce the laws.\" It does not ring true. It does not ring true.\nAnd let me close by saying this, and it's kind of a secret I'll share with you about what happens in African-American communities and in homes. We fear for our children and we fear for these black boys. And I can recall when my son was in school in a certain place in a state that was known to have Ku Klux Klan activity, and he met a very nice young, white boy who wanted him to go to his house for Thanksgiving. But it was in a community where there were no blacks and this community had a reputation.\nAnd I said to my son, \"You can't do that. You cannot do that. You cannot be caught in a community where we know there's been some problems in the past, no matter how much you like your friend and no matter how good you think he is. He probably is a very fine person. But we know that if you get caught at the wrong time and the wrong place, you will become fodder for people whose intentions are not honorable, for people who are racists, for people who would destroy you.\"\nAnd we to continue to remind our children day in and day out about what they can't do, where they can't be, how they got to be careful.\nAnd Ronnie White followed all of the rules, and he had to be careful in order to get where he got. And to be treated the way that he was treated, to be sandbagged the way that he was treated, he'll never get over it, and his career may have been damaged forever.\nAnd so, yes, I understand what you're saying, Senator, about sensitivity. But let me just tell you, those of us who have to guard against getting sandbagged all of our lives call it something else, goes a little bit deeper than simply a lack of sensitivity.\nJACKSON LEE: Will the chairman allow me to...\nLEAHY: Of course.\nJACKSON LEE: He said one or both of us.\nAnd I feel compelled to respond, Senator Schumer, because I think you captured the relationships, the working relationships. We can all work together. You worked with both of us, Congresswoman Waters and myself. And Senator Hatch made a comment as well, along with Senator Durbin, on this whole issue of race. And I want to just refer you, and we asked the question, where were we on the day, tragically, of the assassination of President Kennedy? Many of us ask the same question of where we were the day Martin Luther King was killed.\nThis is not an attempt to create hysteria as much as it is an attempt to characterize for you what we hear and see. We still have heroes in the African-American community, and we still look to that one judge on the Missouri Supreme Court. It was Ronnie White. He's a hero. It was an honor.\nYou may think that African-Americans did not pay attention to that journey on the floor of the Senate, but they did. And, frankly, they viewed the actions of Senator Ashcroft more as a shredding of a man's reputation and his dignity.\nI read the transcript when he came to this committee, and he introduced his wife and his son and he was proud of that and he had his aide here. I saw the language of Senator Kit Bond, in fact, that said he had the necessary qualifications and character traits which were required for the job. William Clay, who is not--who retired, presented him and mentioned that he went first to Senator Ashcroft to get his blessings and believed that he had it.\nI just want to put into the record the numbers, as I conclude, about this whole issue of the death penalty cases, because whenever you see faces like mine you immediately box us in. There is a diverse opinion in our communities on crime and the death penalty, and I can assure you that the African-American community are law-abiding. They are intimidated by crime. They want to make sure those who are convicted fairly of a crime, the crime is addressed. But that is no reason to blanket us and to assume that Justice White could be so tattered and tainted without really looking into his record.\nWe find that Judge White voted to uphold the death sentence in 41 of the 59 cases that came before him, roughly the same proportions Ashcroft's court appointees when he was governor. In fact, of these 59 death penalty cases, Judge White was the sole dissenter in only three of them; that means that he was drawing the other members of the Missouri Supreme Court.\nAnd lastly, what seemed to not get to be part of the record is the 15 cases--and it may be in this record, of course--of which Judge White wrote the majority.\nSenator Biden asked the question to Senator Ashcroft that I think was never asked. Justice Scalia wrote an opinion, in contrary to what you think his views were as it relates to the death penalty, which might have been characterized as liberal. Meaning that it might have been characterized as an opinion where the defendant was given the right to redress his grievances.\nThe question is, did Senator Ashcroft go to the floor of the House to comment on that decision or maybe other decisions of like-situated individuals, or did he single out Justice White?\nAnd so the question I have, on both the segregation or desegregation order, and as well as Justice White, it is not where we stand in times of comfort and calm. It is not the 200 non-controversial appointees that the Clinton administration put forward, even in the Foreign Relations Committee or the Judiciary Committee. We all can find common ground on the non-controversial. It is not the question of whether or not we have friends that we don't have it in our heart.\nSenator Hatch, I don't have any reason to believe that Senator Ashcroft is racist in his spirit, his heart. I only go on his record and his actions, and what I ask the question is--and so I make no accusations here--but what I ask the question is, the vulnerable need the attorney general. I need him; my community needs him. And he will have to make decisions in controversy. He will have to make decisions when it is unpopular to do what is right.\nMy challenge is, or the question I raise is, why in the voluntary efforts of his community, why he didn't rise to the occasion, the man of faith, a man who loved this country, to heal us, applaud the agreement, bring the agreement to the point of success, use his office to guide the agreement to a successful legal end, and a successful end in terms of the communities having it work.\nAnd lastly, with Justice White, why did he not, in the course of making a decision about Justice White, rise in this controversial time that had been created, to the point of looking at his holistic record, for the greater good, rising above politics, and championing Justice White's nomination and successful vote on the floor of the Senate?\nIt is where you stand in time of controversy. And that's what African-Americans, but as well, vulnerable Americans, look to the attorney general's position and the Department of Justice; will you help us when we need you?\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nThe senior senator from Ohio?\nDEWINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI just want to thank our witnesses for their patience today. And appreciate their testimony. I don't have any questions.\nLEAHY: The senator from Alabama?\nSESSIONS: Thank the witnesses. It's good to see you.\nAnd Congresswoman Lee, you've been here all day. I've seen--kind of wish you could have been on this side and maybe seen John's testimony on the face. I think he was very sincere. And I think you'll be very pleased with his service.\nLEAHY: Unless there are further questions, we will stand in recess until 9:30 in the morning.\nJACKSON LEE: Thank you so very much.\nWATERS: Thank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2001-01-17", "title": "Attorney General Nominee John Ashcroft's Senate Confirmation Hearing (Day Two)"}

I also want to thank all the folks, who lined the road, when we came in from the airport for their wonderful hospitality. Laura and I are on a great journey.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIt's hard to believe but 25 years ago I had gotten out of graduate school--a beast--and I wasn't sure where I was going to live but I was sure of what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to start my own business. I knew I wanted to answer the entrepreneurial call I felt in my soul.\nFortunately, a friend of mine named Jimmy Allison Â– many of you may remember Jimmy, he was the publisher of the Midland Reporter Telegram Â– invited me to come here during my spring break, and when I came down I immediately knew the city where I grew up was a city where I wanted to work and where I wanted to live.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThere was so much energy here, not only in the ground...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... but in the lives of the people of West Texas.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe spirit of possibility was as big as the West Texas sky. Twenty-five years later this is my last stop on the way to Washington.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI'm going to take a lot of Midland and a lot of Texas with me up there.\n(APPLAUSE)\nMy many friendships will keep me strong and keep me humble. Won't they?\n(LAUGHTER)\nMy experiences here have shaped the values and principles by which I will make decisions and my service as your governor will be a model by the way I conduct our nation's business.\n(APPLAUSE)\nOur deepest values in life often come from our earliest years. It is here in Midland and in West Texas where I learned to respect people from different backgrounds, to respect people from all walks of life. It is here where I learned what it means to be a good neighbor at backyard barbecues or just chatting across the fence. It is here in West Texas where I learned to trust in God.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThere's so much optimism in this place, such a passion for the possible. You see it everywhere in Midland and you see it throughout West Texas and I certainly saw it in the home where I was raised. It seems improbable now but in that little house on Ohio Street, right down the road from here, it was hard to envision then the future of two presidents and a governor of Florida.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut it really is the American story: Our country's a place of limitless hopes and possibilities, and nowhere is that spirit more alive than in the great state of Texas.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe most important things in my life happened here in Midland. Here I met my wife, Laura.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI fell in love with her grace and goodness and America will, too.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIt was in Dallas that we welcomed our twins into this world, but right after they were born I remember putting them on O'Neill's airplane. They got back to Midland as quickly as possible.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThis is where they spent their early years. It was right down the street from here where they went to Sunday school at the First Methodist Church.\n(APPLAUSE)\nOh, Doc Dodson (ph) taught them a thing or two.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThis place has shaped the values that will shape my service to our nation.\nWhen our family moved into the governor's residence, I had some basic goals in mind. In the West Texas tradition, I had know intention of just marking time. I wanted it to be said of my service that promises made were promises kept. I take special pride in the progress that we have made in Texas. We have made progress in the public school system by raising standards, by insisting upon results, and as importantly, trusting the local folks to make the right decisions for the schools in their communities.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe reformed welfare by encouraging work, while making sure that those with the deepest need continue to get help. We changed juvenile justice laws to say to our children: We love you a lot, but we understand that love and discipline go hand in hand. And I'm proud that we were good stewards of the taxpayers money. With our surpluses, we set priorities. We met essential needs. And, as importantly, we remembered who paid the bills. We sent money back to the taxpayers of the state of Texas.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut what matters most is how we accomplished these goals: by working together, by respecting one another, and by putting the public interest first. Along with Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock, followed by Rick Perry, and fellow West Texan, Speaker Pete Laney, we found ways to get things done. We built trust. I can assure you we disagreed, but when we did so, we did so in a respectful way. This, too, is a spirit that I will carry with me to Washington, D.C.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe respect among elected officials is an extension of the values and diversity of our state. When you talk about Texas today, you're talking about people from so many different backgrounds, different cultures, and different languages. Any conflicts that once divided us now belong to history. We're all Texans, and we're all Americans.\n(APPLAUSE)\nOur respect for each other is the greatest strength we have as a state and this is true of our nation as well. The spirit of respect and common purpose will guide me as your president.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI leave here really upbeat about getting some things done for the people, getting something accomplished for the people of this land. By putting aside all the partisan bickering and name calling and anger and talk about...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSee, I've never been a cynic about public service. I've seen at close range the positive impact a leader can have. My dad taught me in the way he lived that life is more than personal gain, that service to others is a noble calling. I'll always be inspired by his integrity, his example and his good heart. And I'll always be thankful that he raised me in Midland, Texas.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI know the White House does not belong to its occupant. It is ours to look after for awhile. And I promise that my administration will never forget the dignity and duty the White House represents to millions of Americans.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIn a way, Laura and I will never quite settle in Washington. Because while the honor is great, the work is temporary.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI'm leaving Texas, but not forever.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThis is my home.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd when I'm not in Washington, there's a pretty good chance you'll find me on our place in Crawford, Texas. Serving as your governor was the highest honor I could have imagined. There is only one reason on earth that would cause me to leave, and that is the great privilege given me to the people of our country, to serve as your president.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI'm excited about the work. I'm thankful for the lessons and principles I learned here in Midland, Texas. I'm thankful for my friends. I'll come back to see you soon.

Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.), Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Attorney General-designate John Ashcroft.]\nSEN. HATCH: Mr. Chairman, it's with a great deal of honor and privilege that I present you, as our new chairman, with this very, very important gavel...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... to be able to keep order during these hearings and hearings thereafter. But here's the gavel. You have it.\nSEN. LEAHY: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will protect the gavel carefully in the few hours, the brief few hours, I get to do it. And I have a feeling I'll be presenting you with one next week.\nThis, for the public to know, this gavel is actually made by my son, Kevin, in seventh grade. Shows you how long it's been since I've been chairman of anything.\n(LAUGHTER)\nIt's a privilege to call these hearings to order, and I welcome my friend, Orrin Hatch, and all the continuing members on both sides of the aisle.\nWe're being rejoined this year by Senator Durbin of Illinois. Senator Durbin was a very valuable member of this committee when he served here before, before leaving to go to a different committee.\nDick, we're delighted to have you back.\nWe're also joined by Senator Brownback, who has been in the Senate for some time, but this is his first time this year. And Sam and I have worked together on a number of significant pieces of legislation.\nAnd, Sam, I'm delighted to have you in the committee.\nSEN. BROWNBACK: Happy to join you.\nLEAHY: I understand my neighbor from New Hampshire who was sitting on these hearings will be leaving, and I'm sorry to have that happen because Senator Smith and I have also worked together on matters. And we do have the ability to check with each other on what the weather is along the Connecticut River.\nAnd Senator Cantwell of Washington state will be joining us, but she and Senator Biden are at the funeral of our former colleague, Alan Cranston, in California. Senator Cantwell first came to Washington as a staff member of Senator Cranston, and Senator Biden and I and several others here served with him.\nAnd they would be here other than that. And of course, we have the nominee, Senator Ashcroft, his wife, Janet, and others who we'll get to in a few minutes.\nI welcome Senator Ashcroft, who certainly is no stranger to this committee room, and his family here.\nI have said many times, as most of us have, that the position of attorney general is of extraordinary importance. The attorney general is the lawyer for all the people, as the chief law enforcement officer in the country. That's why the attorney general not only needs the full confidence of the president, he or she also needs the confidence and trust of the American people. We all look to the attorney general to ensure even-handed law enforcement and protection of our basic constitutional rights, including the freedom of speech, the right to privacy, a woman's right to choose, freedom from government oppression, and equal protection of all our laws.\nThe attorney general plays a critical role in bringing the country together, in bridging racial divisions and inspiring people's confidence in their government.\nSenator Ashcroft has often taken aggressively activist positions on a number of issues that deeply divide the American people.\nNow, he had a right to take these activist positions, but we also have a duty to evaluate how these positions will affect his conduct as attorney general.\nOn many of these issues and on battles over executive branch or judicial nominees, Senator Ashcroft was not just in the minority of the United States Senate, but in a minority among Republicans in the Senate. Now we have to ask if somebody who has been that unyielding in a policy outlook can unite all Americans. And that's an important question for the Senate.\nNow, the hearing is not about whether we like Senator John Ashcroft or call him a friend. All of us do. All of us like him; all of us know him. It is not about whether we agree or disagree with him on every issue. Many of us have worked productively with him on selected matters and then we've disagreed with him on others.\nLet me be very clear about one thing: This is not about whether Senator Ashcroft is racist, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon or anti-anything else. Those of us who have worked with him in the Senate do not make that charge.\nBut at the same time, I know that all senators and the nominee agree that no one nominated to be attorney general should be given special treatment just because he or she once served in the Senate.\nSo fundamentally, the question before us is whether Senator Ashcroft is the right person at this time for the critical position of attorney general of the United States. The appointment clause of the Constitution gives the Senate the duty and responsibility of providing both its advice and its consent.\nAmong the areas we will explore with Senator Ashcroft is how he fulfilled his constitutional duty as a senator in exercising his own advise and consent authority in connection with executive and judicial nominations. We'll explore the standards he would use in making recommendations to the president on executive and judicial appointments if he's confirmed as attorney general.\nPresident Kennedy observed that to govern is to choose. What choices the next attorney general makes about resources and priorities will have a dramatic impact on almost every aspect of the society in which we live. The American people want to know not just whether this nominee will commit to enforce the laws on the books, but what his priorities will be, what choices he is likely to make and what changes he will seek in the law. Most importantly, we will want to know what changes he will seek in the constitutional rights that Americans currently enjoy.\nThese include what positions he would urge upon the Supreme Court; in particular, whether he'd ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade or to impose more burdensome restrictions on a woman's ability to secure a safe and legal contraceptives.\nNow, we're proceeding expeditiously with these hearings as requested by President-elect Bush, as I told him I would. But I have also said from the outset that these hearings have to be thorough, but they have to be fair and they will be.\nSenator Hatch?\nHATCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI'm glad to welcome the members of the Ashcroft family and you, Senator Ashcroft, the witnesses here today, including Senator Ashcroft's highly accomplished wife, Janet, who has been a professor of business law here in Washington, D.C., at Howard University for the past five years. I want to take a moment to let the Ashcroft family know how much we appreciate their sacrifices while John has served in public office.\nJohn Ashcroft is no stranger to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He served on our committee with distinction over the past four years, working closely with members on both sides of the aisle on a variety of issues ranging from privacy rights to racial profiling.\nAs a member of the committee, he proved himself a leader in many areas, including the fight against drugs and violence, the assessment of the proper role of the Justice Department, and the protection of victims' rights.\nJohn has an impressive record--almost 30 years of public service.\nEight years as Missouri state attorney general, during which time he was elected by his 50 state attorney general peers to head the National Association of Attorneys General.\nEight years as governor of the great state of Missouri, during which time he was elected by the 50 governors to serve as the head of the National Governors' Association.\nSix years in the United States Senate, four of which, he has served here with us on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nOf the 67 attorneys general in the history of this country, only a handful come even close to having even some of the qualifications that John Ashcroft brings in assuming the position of chief law enforcement officer of this great nation.\nThe Department of Justice, of course, encompasses broad jurisdiction. It includes the executive administration of organizations ranging from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, all of the United States attorneys throughout the country, to the Bureau of Prisons.\nIt includes, among other things, enforcement of the law in areas including antitrust, terrorism, fraud, money laundering, organized crime, drugs and immigration--just to mention a few.\nTo effectively prevent and manage crises in these important areas, one thing is certain: We needed to have a no-nonsense person with the background and experience of John Ashcroft. Those charged with enforcing the law of the nation must demonstrate both the proper understanding of that law and a determination to uphold its letter and spirit. This is the standard I have applied to nominees in the past, and this is the standard that I am applying to John Ashcroft here.\nDuring John Ashcroft's 30-year service for the public, he has worked to establish a number of things to keep Americans safe and free from criminal activities: tougher sentencing laws for serious crimes, keeping drugs out of the hands of children, improving our nation's immigration laws, protecting citizens from fraud, protecting competition in business. He has supported funding increases for law enforcement. He held the first hearings ever on the issue of racial profiling.\nAnd he's been a leader for victim's rights in accordance of law and otherwise; helped to enact the violence against women bill, provisions making violence at abortion clinics fines nondischargeable--and bankruptcy; authored anti-stalking laws, fought to allow women accused of homicide to have the privilege of presenting battered-spouse syndrome evidence in the courts of law. As governor, he commuted the sentences of two women, who did not have that privilege. He signed Missouri's hate crimes bill into law. I could go on and on. His record is distinguished.\nSenator Ashcroft, during these hearings, we are eager to hear and the American people are eager to hear your plans for making America a safer place to live. A great number of people have said to me that they are tired of living in fear. They want to go to sleep at night without worrying about the safety of their children or about becoming victims of crime themselves.\nI know you and I am familiar with your distinguished 30-year record of enforcing and upholding law. And I feel a great sense of comfort and a new-found security in your nomination to be our nation's chief law enforcement officer.\nMr. Chairman, I have one request of my colleagues as we proceed: In keeping with our promise to work in a bipartisan fashion, I ask that we begin with a rejection of the politics of division. If we want to encourage the most qualified citizens to serve in government, we must do everything we can to stop what has been termed the politics of personal destruction.\nThis is not to say that we should put an end to an open and candid debate on policy issues.\nQuite the contrary. Our system of government is designed to promote the expression of these differences, and our Constitution protects it. But the fact is that all of us, both Democrats and Republicans, know the difference between legitimate policy debate and unwarranted personal attacks promoted and sometimes urged by narrow special interest groups.\nJohn Ashcroft, like many of us, is a man of strongly held views. I have every confidence, based on his distinguished record, that as attorney general he will vigorously work to enforce the law, whether or not the law happens to be consistent with his personal views.\nFinally, Mr. Chairman, you know that I would have preferred a format similar to that followed for President Clinton's nominees and prior nominees for the last four attorney general nominees: no more than a two-day hearing with outside interest groups submitting their testimony in writing. But I'm sure that you will endeavor to be fair as we proceed with this hearing. I have confidence in that. And I look forward to these proceedings and look forward to participating in them.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Hatch. And I can assure you the hearings will be fair. There are 280 million Americans who have views on who should be attorney general. There will be interest groups to the left or the right who may have suggestions. Ultimately, there's only 100 Americans who'll get to vote on that issue, and that's the 100 members of the Senate. And it will be--the whole tone of the debate and all will be decided by us.\nJust so we can understand, we'll do this. We should give each senator an opportunity for brief opening remarks. I'd ask if they could keep it at three or four minutes. We'll then turn to the nominee, both for the introductions and an opening remark. And then we'll have the opportunity to question the nominee for 15 minutes each in the first go-round and then shorter ones if we need to after that.\nWhat I would do, too, once we have all finished, we'll take a very short break just so that those who are going to introduce him and all will know what's going to happen.\nBut with that, I would turn to the distinguished senior senator from Massachusetts, and also a former chairman of this committee, Senator Kennedy.\nSEN. KENNEDY: Thank you.\nMr. Chairman, thank you for holding these hearings. They may well be the most important hearings that our committee will have this year. The power and reach of the Department of Justice is vast and the person at its head must have the ability and the commitment to enforce the laws vigorously. The reality and perception of fairness must be without question.\nDuring Senator Ashcroft's quarter-century in public service, he has taken strong positions on a range of important issues in the jurisdiction of the Justice Department.\nUnfortunately and often, he has used the power of his high office to advance his personal views in spite of the law of the land. The vast majority of Americans support vigorous enforcement of our civil rights laws, and those laws and the Constitution demand it.\nSenator Ashcroft, however, spent significant parts of his term as attorney general of Missouri, and his term as governor, strongly opposing school desegregation and voter registration in St. Louis. The vast majority of Americans believe in access to contraception and a woman's right to choose, and our laws and Constitution demand it. Senator Ashcroft does not. His intense efforts have made him one of the principal architects of the ongoing right-wing strategy to dismantle Roe v. Wade and abolish a woman's right to choose.\nDeep concerns have been raised about his record on gun control. He has called James Brady the leading enemy of responsible gun owners. Senator Ashcroft is so far out of the mainstream that he has said citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against a tyrannical government. Our government, tyrannical? In fact, he relies on an extreme reading of the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment to the Constitution to oppose virtually all gun control laws.\nHe doesn't show the same respect for the right of free speech under the First Amendment. In 1978, as attorney general of Missouri, he tried to use the antitrust laws to undermine the right to free speech of the National Organization for Women and prevent a boycott of Missouri by the organization over the state's refusal to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\nAs these few examples demonstrate, the clear question before the Senate is whether, if confirmed as attorney general, Senator Ashcroft will be capable of fully and fairly enforcing the nation's laws to benefit all Americans, even though he profoundly disagrees with many of the most important of those laws. His past actions strongly suggest that he will not.\nSenator Ashcroft's record in Missouri and in the Senate is extremely troubling on this basic question. Many of us, probably all of us, who have served with Senator Ashcroft respect his ability on the issues and his intense commitment to the principles he believes in, even though we disagree profoundly with some of those principles.\nWe know that while serving in high office, he has time and again aggressively used litigation and legislation in creative and inappropriate ways to advance his political and ideological goals. How can we have any confidence at all that he won't do the same thing with the vast new powers he will have at his disposal as attorney general of the United States?\nPresident-elect Bush has asked us to look in Senator Ashcroft's heart to evaluate his ability and commitment to enforce the laws of our country. But actions speak louder than words, and based on his repeated actions over many years, it's clear that Senator Ashcroft's heart is not in some of the most important of the nation's laws.\nThe person who serves as attorney general must inspire the trust and respect of all Americans. Inscribed in stone over the center entrance to the Department of Justice is this phrase: \"The place of justice is a hallowed place.\" All Americans deserve to have confidence that when the next attorney general walks through the doors of justice and into that hallowed place, he will be serving them too.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the hearing.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Kennedy.\nWe'll put Senator Biden's statement in the record and turn to my good friend from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond.\nSEN. THURMOND: Thank you.\nMr. Chairman, I am very pleased that President-elect Bush has chosen John Ashcroft to serve as his attorney general.\nSenator Ashcroft is one of the most qualified people selected for this position in many years. He served two terms as attorney general of Missouri, rising to become the leader of the National Association of Attorneys General. He was then elected governor of Missouri, also serving for two terms, and rising to chair the National Governors Association. I would also note that he has a fine wife and family.\nMost recently, Senator Ashcroft has been an effective leader in the Senate with a record of legislative accomplishments. For example, he was instrumental in passing a methanphetomine bill to help keep drugs out of the hands of children. Also, he worked in a bipartisan manner with Democrats to support COPS program funding for law enforcement.\nIn the Senate, his job was to make the laws, but as attorney general, his job will be to enforce the laws. It is clear that he understands that people in different positions have different roles because he has expressed concerns about federal judges who do not understand the separation of powers. I am confident that as attorney general he will enforce all the laws to the best of his ability, whether he helped enact them or not.\nI hope that these hearings will not be about whoever the nominee agrees with each senator on every issue. After all, he is the president's choice and the president makes the ultimate policy decisions. A question should be whether he is qualified and will enforce the laws. The answer is clearly, yes.\nTwenty years ago, I recommended him to be attorney general for President Ronald Reagan, and would like to place that letter into the record.\nLEAHY: Without objection.\nTHURMOND: And I'd like for that to appear at the end of my statement.\nI recognized his abilities then, and the passing years, while he has served as governor and senator, have only reinforced my belief he would have made a fine attorney general in 1981. He will make an outstanding attorney general in 2001.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Thurmond.\nWe'll put into record a statement by Senator Biden, who is, as I said, is at Senator Cranston's funeral.\nAnd we turn to the distinguished senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl.\nSEN. KOHL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Ashcroft, welcome back to this committee.\nBased upon what I know of your record thus far, I could not vote for you to be a Supreme Court justice, but this is different. As I said to previous nominees for attorney general, when considering Cabinet nominations I approach the process prepared to give deference to the president's choice. The president is entitled to surround himself with the people he trusts.\nThis deference, however, does not rise to the level of blind acceptance. And so, Senator Ashcroft, you have a responsibility to convince this panel and the American people that your views will not interfere with the administration of justice.\nLaws are administered and interpreted by people. You have strong convictions. You often wear them on your sleeve and you take great pride in your convictions. You certainly are not to be faulted for this.\nBut it is not credible to say that you are or anyone can just administer the law like a robot, as if the law is not subject to feelings or strong convictions. It is up to you to explain to us why your convictions will not permeate or dominate or even overwhelm the Department of Justice.\nRemember, the attorney general must be a role model and not a lightning rod for certain causes. You have been passionate about many issues: civil rights, abortion, gun safety and the environment, to cite just a few.\nBut there must be no doubt in the minds of Americans that you will fairly enforce the law. The attorney general must vigorously advocate for all Americans and, most particularly, protect those who cannot defend themselves.\nYour many years as a politician make some people wonder whether you are prepared to dispassionately administer the law. Surely, you understand that many of the positions you've taken are unpopular with some members of this committee. You shouldn't be condemned for disagreeing with people, but rather you must convince the American people that you will enforce the laws of the land in a way that will make us proud and will make us feel that it is justice that is certainly being done.\nI've enjoyed working with you as a colleague, and I look forward to this hearing and your answers to our questions.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: I turn to the distinguished senior senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\nSEN. GRASSLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm pleased to welcome Senator John Ashcroft back to the committee today. I know him, from working with him, to be a man of integrity and also a person who loves America.\nI've been privileged to serve with John here in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee for the past six years. During this time, I've come to respect John's legal abilities and his keen insight into public policy.\nJohn shares my concern about crime and has worked hard in the war against drugs. He's helped increase funding for local law enforcement and pushed for tougher sentences for criminals. John is also extremely concerned about the victims of crimes, having signed into law Missouri's Victims' Bill of Rights when he was governor of that state. John also cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act when he was here in the Senate.\nNow John and I come from states where agriculture issues are very important, and we've had a number of discussions about how to best address the myriad of problems that are facing the family farmers today. He's concerned about ensuring competitive markets and a level playing field for farmers and independent producers. Based on my experience with Senator Ashcroft's work here in the Senate, I know that he is committed to doing what is right for the family farmer.\nJohn Ashcroft is a man of the law. He is eminently qualified to serve as this nation's attorney general. His background as governor and attorney general of Missouri are some of the strongest qualifications that I've seen for this job. I believe that he will vigorously enforce all of our nation's laws. I believe that Senator Ashcroft will uphold the rule of law for all Americans, which will be a refreshing change from the way things were done in the present administration, where the Justice Department was more a defense counsel for the president than the nation's chief law enforcer.\nJohn Ashcroft's integrity, then, will be a breath of fresh air.\nI do want to make a comment about the mob of extremists who have hit the airwaves and are trying to intimidate members of the Senate into voting against Senator Ashcroft. I hope that my colleagues have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to these extremist accusations. It's remarkable that accusations of bias and racism have increased to a roaring crescendo now that John Ashcroft has come up for confirmation, because if John Ashcroft is so bad, then why did the people of Missouri elect him Missouri attorney general, governor and senator? Would the majority of Missouri citizens support such a biased and extreme man to serve and represent them for well over two decades? I don't think so.\nWould the National Association of Attorneys General and the National Governors Association, two national associations representing both Republican and Democratic attorneys general and governors, name such a biased man to lead their organization?\nI don't think so. But the smear goes on.\nI, for one, will make my decision based on facts, not innuendo, and rumor and spin. I will not let special interests groups with an agenda far out of the mainstream hijack the Judiciary Committee.\nJohn Ashcroft is a man of great character, integrity and trust--all values which are absolutely necessary for public service. He is an excellent lawyer, committed to enforcing all the laws.\nAbove all, I know John Ashcroft to be a man concerned about the well-being of our country and committed to doing what is right for all Americans. I believe John Ashcroft will be an excellent attorney general, and at this point, I see absolutely no legitimate reason why he should not be confirmed.\nI yield.\nLEAHY: I thank the senator.\nI should just note for the record, Senator Hatch had expressed a wish that we follow procedures of holding the hearing for the nominee, or at most two days. Our committee hearing has been a little bit more varied than that. I would note that the Democratic president nominated Griffin Bell, it was a Democratic-controlled Senate. We had a hearing for seven days. We heard from 26 witnesses. When President Reagan nominated Ed Meese, and there was a Republican-controlled Senate, the hearing was in two parts: the first was four days with 31 witnesses, the second part was three days with 17 witnesses. With President Clinton, his first nominee Ms. Baird, was for two days. There were going to be a number of outside witnesses, but of course the nomination was withdrawn.\nHaving said that, you know, as I have told the distinguished senator, my good friend from Utah, that if he has witnesses that he wants heard, of course, they'll be heard. There will be no unnecessary delays. I turn now to the distinguished...\nHATCH: If the senator would yield for just one comment on that.\nLEAHY: Of course.\nHATCH: In the last four attorneys general, we had one day for Richard Thornburgh, we had two days for Attorney General William Barr, we had one day for Janet Reno--or two days for Janet Reno. And I might mention--and she was the sole witness. Bill Barr was his sole witness, other than the introducers, and I think Dick Thornburgh was his sole witness.\nAnd I might add that I can remember when Janet Reno came up and I had every special interest group on the right wanting to oppose her, I refused to allow that. We took their statements and paid attention to them, but I didn't do what we're doing here today.\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman...\nHATCH: Now, you have the right to make this decision. All I'm saying is is that I want to point out that the last three or four didn't go more than two days.\nLEAHY: Well, I notice among our...\nHATCH: And they were the sole witnesses.\nLEAHY: ... our list of left-wing witnesses, The Heritage Foundation and a few like that, I suspect...\nHATCH: For Mason, two conservatives, that's true...\nLEAHY: I suspect that you're going to have...\nHATCH: ... way back when.\nLEAHY: ... that you're going to have all you want, but I would also note, as I said, when the Democrats were in control of the Senate and the Democratic president, it did take us seven days and 26 witnesses when the Republicans controlled. These are my seminal hearings, you see, Senator Hatch. It's...\nHATCH: And I put...\nLEAHY: ... the influence of your party and probably four days--anyway.\nHATCH: Well, just one more...\nLEAHY: Can we hear from the distinguished...\nHATCH: Mr. Chairman, just one more point of privilege.\nLEAHY: I'm trying to speed this thing up.\nHATCH: Well, we know that J.C. Watts asked to testify and he's not on the members' one, and we would like to have the Honorable Kenneth Holsaw (ph) testify on the same panel as the Honorable Ronnie White because he can...\nLEAHY: He's on the members' panel.\nHATCH: ... he was the prosecutor in one of the...\nLEAHY: He's on a members' panel and...\nHATCH: But we would like him to be on that panel because then it would be fair because then he can explain what happened.\nLEAHY: All right. Let's go on with the...\nHATCH: Well, I hope you'll give consideration to that because it would be highly unfair if you don't.\nLEAHY: Well, I think the difficult thing, as you know, we sent you over our list of witnesses. And then we waited and waited for days to hear back from you.\nHATCH: I always waited for yours, as well.\nLEAHY: This is the distinguished and highly confident senior senator from California.\nSEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman, I believe that the people of this nation deserve an attorney general who will be honest, strong and fair, whose integrity is beyond question and who will vigorously protect the rights of every American under law.\nIn my meeting with Senator Ashcroft, I assured him that I would keep an open mind and do everything I possibly could to see to it that he got a full and fair hearing. And I believe he's going to get just that. So I've not yet taken a position on whether I would or would not support his nomination to be attorney general of the United States.\nBut Mr. Ashcroft's past positions on civil rights, on human rights, on segregation, on affirmative action, on a woman's right to choose, on gun laws are very different from my own. All of the above areas are, today, covered by law. For civil rights, we have the Civil Rights Act and Title VII. For a woman's right to choose, the United States Supreme Court has adjudicated Roe v. Wade. For gun control, the ban on assault weapons, which I had something to do with, the National Firearms Act and the Brady bill are all laws of our land.\nWe all know Senator Ashcroft as an independent thinker, as a strong advocate for his beliefs. Many of us on this committee have worked with him on various pieces of legislation; I, for one, on methamphetamine. And he has been gracious, true to his word and a very good person with whom to work.\nFor the past six years as senator and before that as governor, John Ashcroft served as a representative of the people of Missouri. This advocacy was both appropriate and strong-minded. But the attorney general of the United States must be prepared to use the full force and authority of that position to vigorously enforce all laws, regardless of personal belief. It's not enough, for example, for an attorney general to say he will enforce the laws and then appoint a solicitor general whose goal will be to undercut them.\nAnd all of this raises in my mind serious questions. Can we expect, for example, an unabashed and vocal opponent of reproductive rights for women to vigorously enforce laws that protect a woman's right to choose? Will Senator Ashcroft continue to vigorously enforce the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and retain the National Task Force on Violence against Health Care Providers? Would Justice under his leadership provide a vigorous defense of Roe v. Wade?\nWill he fully enforce and support the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition clips, and the Brady law? Would he be steadfast in opposition to allowing violent felons to obtain guns, simply by applying for this right to be restored?\nWould he unwaveringly and vigorously use the office of attorney general to protect Americans from violent hate crimes and other civil rights violations? Would he ensure that no citizen's right to vote is compromised by an illegal act?\nThese are questions that don't relate to character or integrity, but they are also questions that must be answered.\nToday, we begin the process of ensuring that our system of laws will be enforced with moral authority and fair effectiveness. So I look forward to asking some tough questions, hopefully receiving good answers, and giving Senator Ashcroft the full and fair hearing.\nThank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: And I turn now to the distinguished senior senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.\nSEN. SPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nFrom the opening statements, it's perfectly apparent that the battle lines are pretty well drawn--pretty hard to even agree on a schedule. Fortunately, the hearing room table is set in advance, so there's no dispute about that. And for a Senate which has talked so much about bipartisanship, we haven't gotten off to a very good start on the first issue which we are confronting.\nIt would be disingenuous for any of us to say that we don't have views about former Senator John Ashcroft. Having worked with him for six years, including extensive work on this committee, I had thought that I knew John Ashcroft pretty well until I started to read about him in the papers and listen to the electronic media.\nWell, seriously, we know about his strong ideological views, and the critical factor, obviously, is whether John Ashcroft has the ability and the willingness and the temperament to separate his own personal views from law enforcement. And there is a big difference.\nOn a lesser scale, I served as a prosecuting attorney, DA of Philadelphia, so I know what it's like to enforce laws that I don't particularly agree with.\nAnd I think it is fair and this committee has a constitutional responsibility to find out from John Ashcroft that he will give assurances to the American people on critical issues.\nA matter has already been raised about the right to choose and access to abortion clinics. And I think it is significant that Senator Ashcroft voted on a bankruptcy issue counter to those who would try to stop abortions. The issue is whether somebody who had a judgment in a civil case would be discharged in bankruptcy, which is the general rule. Without getting too deeply involved, John Ashcroft voted that they should not be discharged in bankruptcy if the judgment came from blocking an abortion clinic.\nThere are legitimate concerns about the First Amendment as to Attorney General John Ashcroft's views, if he is confirmed, enforcing the separation of church and state. There is no doubt about the latitude for a president's Cabinet, for, in effect, the president's lawyer, although the attorney general is the lawyer of the American people as well. And there is also no doubt about the enormous difference between a federal judgeship, say a Supreme Court judgeship, where ideology would play a very different role than would the nation's chief law enforcement officer.\nWe are under a microscope, as we all know, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that we can put partisanship aside. There is no doubt that if it becomes a partisan issue, that this nomination can be blocked by a refusal to cut off debate. And feelings are running very, very high, lots of calls on both sides, great intensity. I haven't seen this much intensity for more than a decade, not that we haven't had it in this room, but not for more than a decade.\nAnd if the passions run high enough and partisanship takes over, it will not be in the interest of the American people.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nThe distinguished senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold.\nSEN. FEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLet me begin by touching on two general principles to guide our consideration of Cabinet nominations. The first principle is that the Constitution imposes the duty on the president to faithfully execute the laws, and he is expected to propose new laws. To carry out these duties, the president needs advisers and policy-makers in the Cabinet to advance the president's program. Over the history of such nominations, the Senate, with rare exceptions, has given the president broad leeway in choosing subordinates.\nThe second principle that I think should govern nominations is what we might call the political golden rule. We, as Democrats, should, if at all possible, do unto the Republicans as we would have the Republicans do unto us. A Democratic president ought to be able to appoint to the Cabinet principled people of strong progressive or even liberal ideology. And therefore, a Republican president ought to be able to appoint people of strong conservative ideology.\nNow, whether doing so is good politics, or more importantly is wise, in light of a promise to unify the nation after a very close election, is a very important issue for a sustained national debate. But that is not at the core of our responsibility in this body to advise and consent on Cabinet nominations.\nNow, as to the case of former Senator John Ashcroft for attorney general, I think John Ashcroft is highly qualified, from the points of view of competence and experience. During the past six years, I've had the opportunity to get to know John Ashcroft as a colleague. I have had little contact with him outside the Senate floor or the committee rooms. In one of those very few encounters, I and Senator Paul Wellstone were walking outside the Capitol, and John Ashcroft offered us a short ride to our homes.\nLet me tell you on the record, it should give at least some comfort that he was not nominated for secretary of transportation.\n(LAUGHTER)\nIt was a kind gesture, but a wild, somewhat hair-raising ride.\nAdvise and consent, however, is not about who is a nice guy or collegiality. And in all seriousness, this is a very painful nomination for many Americans in light of John Ashcroft's views and votes on many issues, ranging from the right to choose, to gay-lesbian rights, to affirmative action, to the environment, to others. And I am also alarmed by some of these views.\nYet my own direct experience with John Ashcroft has been positive in the sense that he has been much more open to my strong feelings on issues, such as the outrageous practice of racial profiling, than almost all of his Republican colleagues on this committee and in the Senate as a whole. He and his staff not only permitted, but assisted in a significant and powerful hearing on racial profiling in the Constitution Subcommittee which John Ashcroft and I led at the time.\nNonetheless, although that experience is certainly relevant to my consideration, I want the individuals and groups that have raised concerns about the nomination to know this: I understand and agree that that experience should be one and only one of many other more important factors to be considered in judging the fitness of this nominee as attorney general.\nIn fact, as I consider the merits of this nomination, I can't help but take this moment to express my concern about the attitude and approach that the former and then future Republican majority in the Senate has taken since 1996 in considering executive appointments and judicial appointments. The previous majority--and, yes, sometimes led by John Ashcroft--seemed never to accept the legitimacy of President Clinton's 1996 victory.\nInstead, in my view, they unfairly blocked many legitimate qualified appointees, such as Bill Lann Lee, Ronnie White and James Hormel. I think this is wrong. And even Chief Justice Reinquist blamed the under-staffing of the federal judiciary on this questionable approach. This is the very partisanship with which the American people have grown so frustrated and dismayed.\nSo it is not easy to tell those who fought so hard for Clinton and then for Gore that we should follow the golden rule, do the right thing, and not use a similar approach during the next four years. That's my inclination, but I openly wonder at what point we have to draw the line, given the previous majority's refusal to accord the Democrats the very deference that they, the Republicans, now seek.\nLet me also commend the individuals and groups with whom I agree on virtually all of the key issues for prompting a significant national discussion on this nomination. Despite criticism, you are right to intensely scrutinize this nomination. Regardless of the outcome, this process will reap long-term benefits as these legitimate and heartfelt concerns I heard by all senators and the American people.\nBut in the end, Mr. Chairman, let me also repeat my conviction, as this hearing begins, that voting records and conservative ideology are not a sufficient basis to reject a Cabinet nominee, even for attorney general. I say this as a progressive Democrat from Wisconsin who hopes that the William O. Douglases and Ramsey Clarks of the future will be appointed to executive positions and Cabinets and not be rejected on that basis alone.\nIn other words, Mr. Chairman, being in the middle of the road is not a requirement for a Cabinet position.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nI turn to the distinguished senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\nKYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it is appropriate, first, that we welcome our colleague back to this committee, and I do that with great fondness--and also his wife, Janet, who is here.\nSecond, that we focus a little bit on the standard for judging nominees of the president to Cabinet positions. And both Senators Feinstein and Feingold have, I think, spoken eloquently to that point here. And I would like to in a moment, as well.\nThe last Cabinet secretary we had a chance to vote on was the treasury secretary, Larry Summers. And I remember at the time, he had spoken out very strongly against tax cuts, and I'm very much for tax cuts. I thought some of the things he said were relatively outrageous in that regards. But I voted to confirm him, as did I think every one of my colleagues, because of the standard which I think has historically been applied. And I'd like to quote an eloquent statement of that standard by a member of this committee in connection with another nominee a few years ago.\nOur colleague at this time said, \"The Senate has a responsibility to advice and consent on Department of Justice and other executive branch nominees. And we must always take our advice and consent responsibilities seriously because they are among the most sacred. But I think most senators will agree that the standard we apply in the case of executive branch appointments is not as stringent as that for judicial nominees. The president should get to pick his own team. Unless the nominee is incompetent or some other major ethical or investigative problem arises in the course of our carrying out our duties, then the president gets the benefit of the doubt. There is no doubt about this nominee's qualifications or integrity. This is not a lifetime appointment to the judicial branch of government. President Clinton should be given latitude in naming executive branch appointees, people to whom he will turn for advice.\"\nAnd our colleague went on to say, with respect to this particular nominee, \"Yes, he has advised and spoken out about high profile constitutional issues of the day. I would hope that an accomplished legal scholar would not shrink away from public positions on controversial issues as it appears his opponents would prefer. One can question Professor Delanger's (ph) positions and beliefs, but not his competence and legal abilities.\"\nThe eloquence, of course, is easily recognized as that of the chairman, Senator Leahy of Vermont, speaking on behalf of Walter Delanger (ph), who was confirmed for assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, in which he acquitted himself admirably.\nAnd I think that is the standard. And when applying it to John Ashcroft there can be no doubt that he should be confirmed.\nOthers have spoken of his qualifications. Perhaps it would be of interest to note that he is the first attorney general nominee in the history of the United States that has served as state attorney general, governor and U.S. senator.\nOnly six of the 67 former U.S. attorneys general had even some of Senator Ashcroft's experience. He led the National Association of Attorneys General. He was chairman of the National Governors Association, as well as chairman of the Education Commission of the states. And as all of my colleagues know, he served on this committee and chaired the subcommittee on the Constitution. He has the intelligence, a degree from Yale and the prestige law degree from the University of Chicago. And, of course, I think no one has questioned his integrity.\nNow, there have been questions raised. I think, if my colleagues have an open mind, as both Senator Feinstein and Senator Feingold noted, Senator Ashcroft can answer many of these questions. I would just note, for example, that with respect to the charge that he opposes virtually any gun control, you can be assured that that's simply incorrect. And he will make that clear.\nI think at the end of the day one thing is very clear. There have been two interesting assertions made with respect to Senator Ashcroft by opponents. The first is that he has very strong convictions, faith and belief in God. Indeed, he does.\nThe second is that he may not enforce the law and the Constitution. Well, the second assertion is at odds with the first. You can be assured that when John Ashcroft places his hand on the Bible and swears to uphold the laws and the Constitution, that he will do that on behalf of the people of the United States of America.\nLEAHY: I would note, as my friend from Arizona has quoted me, just so people understand the setting for that vote on Walter Delanger (ph), this was a matter that had been delayed by secret holds on the Republican side for months. And I was arguing they should vote him up or vote him down. He was not the attorney general; he would take orders from the attorney general, something that makes a big difference. But what I wanted was a vote up or down. And when the secret holds were released, he was confirmed.\nI turn to the distinguished senior senator from New York.\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd welcome, Senator Ashcroft. I know we have our differences, but I want to thank you for being open and honest with us in this process and making yourself available to all of our questions.\nIn return, let me be straight with you. As you know, I have misgivings about your nomination to be attorney general. I haven't come to this conclusion easily. Unquestionably, you deserve a full and fair hearing and a real chance to tell your side of the story.\nMoreover, I believe we owe a significant level of deference to the president in his choices for Cabinet. The president does not have carte blanche, but usually the presumption at least begins in favor of his nominees. I will support the vast majority of the president-elect's nominees, even though I don't agree with them on many issues.\nI know that a number of my Democratic colleagues initially voiced some support for your nomination because of this presumption, but I think now that the record has been more closely reviewed, the burden of proof has shifted back to you.\nWhen we met privately last week, I asked Senator Ashcroft what role ideology should play in our confirmation process. I meant that question sincerely. It's a difficult issue that many of us are wrestling with.\nA few years ago, Senator Ashcroft opposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at DOJ. At the time, this is what he said about Lee, quote, \"He has, obviously, the incredibly strong capacities to be an advocate, but I think his pursuit of specific objectives that are important to him limit his capacity to have a balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs that division.\"\nLooking back now, I think Senator Ashcroft was correct, at least when it comes to evaluating nominees who have an ideological bent that is significantly outside the mainstream. In other words, the issue should be whether a nominee's fervent beliefs and views are so one-sided that we lose faith, that the American people lose faith, in that person's ability to carefully evaluate, abide by and uphold the law, the law as it is not as he might like it to be.\nThis is even more the case for an attorney general nominee, because the position requires the utmost in balanced judgment, clarity of thought, sound use of discretion, and cautious decision-making.\nThe question I hope these hearings will help us to answer is whether John Ashcroft's passionate advocacy of his deeply held beliefs over the past 25 years will limit his capacity to have the balanced worldview necessary for an attorney general.\nThis is a man who has dedicated his career to eliminating a woman's right to choose. He believes that abortion is murder, that it's wrong and that it must be stopped. He has led the charge to enact new hurdles and restrictions against choice.\nSenator, you have told me you will enforce the law, but just saying so isn't enough. When your solicitor general gets the chance to tell the Supreme Court to follow Roe v. Wade, will you demur? When the HHS secretary calls you for an analysis of new regulations restricting the right to choose, will your analysis be based solely on the current state of law? When you allocate the billions of dollars that DOJ receives, how much will go to protecting the clinics where you think murder is being committed?\nSenator Ashcroft, as much as I respect you as a person and your faith, your past causes me grave concern on these issues. And like Bill Lann Lee, when you became the attorney general of Missouri, you did not relinquish your role as a passionate advocate. You sued nurses who dispensed contraception and continued litigating against them for years, despite being told by every court you came before that you were wrong.\nYou sued the National Organization of Women under the antitrust laws to muzzle their attempt to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Will you now use, as United States attorney general, that office to continue crusading against those you passionately and fervently disagree with?\nSenator Ashcroft, the issue boils down to this: When you have been such a zealous and impassioned advocate for so long, how do you just turn it off? This may be an impossible task.\nAnd I would say to my friend from Wisconsin, this goes beyond ideology; it goes directly to and is unique to the Cabinet position of attorney general, the chief law enforcement officer of the land.\nSenator Ashcroft has been a leading advocate against gun control. He has fought to kill legislation that would have made it easier to catch illegal gun runners. He has vociferously opposed even child safety locks and the assault weapons ban. When the U.S. attorney from New York or Wisconsin calls him and pleads for more resources to prosecute gun runners, will this be a priority?\nFor many years in Missouri, Senator Ashcroft was a leading advocate against desegregation, he's been on the forefront of arguing against gay rights and for lowering barriers between church and state. In short, John Ashcroft has for decades now been knee-deep in many of the most significant, yet decisive, issues in our country.\nWhat this hearing must get at is whether he can now step outside this ideological fray, set his advocacy to one side and become the balanced decision-maker with an unclouded vision of the law that this country deserves as its attorney general.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: The distinguished senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.\nDEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\nWe are now at a place in our nation's history where it sometimes seems as if there is a direct relationship between the qualifications, the experience, the length of service of the particular nominee and how contentious and how difficult the nomination process is.\nToday, we have a nominee who has extensive experience, who is extremely well-qualified: assistant attorney general of Missouri, eight years as attorney general, eight years as governor, six years as U.S. senator, member of this Judiciary Committee.\nTherefore, I guess it should come as no surprise that he's taken positions, that he's taken positions on many, many issues. He's cast thousands of votes and he has a long track record.\nNor, frankly, should it come as a surprise that a record of a quarter of a century would generate criticism. I think we would worry if he hadn't taken tough positions. I think we would worry if, after a quarter of a century, there wasn't something controversial about what he had said or what he had done.\nI intend, during this hearing, to listen. My personal experience with John Ashcroft over the last six years convinces me that he is a man of integrity, he is a man of honor, he is a man of courage.\nThe position of attorney general is unique, as my colleagues have already pointed out, among members of the United States Cabinet. His is, in many respects, the most difficult job, because he is the person who must, by statute, give advice to the president of the United States. But he is also, in essence, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.\nUltimately, the tenure of John Ashcroft as attorney general or the tenure of any attorney general will be judged not on any one particular decision that he will make, not on any one particular policy that he will take.\nUltimately, this attorney general and any attorney general will be judged on how he is perceived, how he is perceived by the public on much more essential issues and much more essential questions: the question of whether or not he was a man of integrity, whether or not he was a man of honesty, whether or not he had the courage to tell the president yes when it was right to tell him yes, and also to tell him no, if that was he needed to tell him.\nI'm going to listen. But I am convinced, based upon what I have heard so far and what I know about John Ashcroft, is that after he has been attorney general the people will look up and say, \"Yes, this was a man of integrity. We did not always agree with him. We may have disagreed with him on some issues. Maybe he wasn't always right. He gained the respect of the American people and he brought honor and integrity to the office.\"\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nJust so we'll let people know where we are, we have four more senators to speak and we will try to stay within the three to four minutes each. And then, what I will do at the end of these four, we will take--as I've told Senator Ashcroft and Senator Bond, Senator Hutchison and others, we'll take a short break just so we can recoup and then come back and have the introductions and the opening statements.\nThe distinguished senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\nDURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nIt is good to be back on the committee and it's interesting that this would be the kick off for my return to the committee, a hearing of this consequence.\nLEAHY: We like you senior senators over here.\nDURBIN: Well, thank you.\nI agree wholeheartedly with the statement made by Senator Hatch relative to the nature of this hearing and this investigation.\nJohn Ashcroft, this should have nothing to do with your personal life or family life. As some have said, the politics of personal destruction should come to an end. And I don't believe this hearing will engage in any questions relative to that, nor should it. For a good reason: You have a fine family you're very proud of, and we have plenty to concern ourselves with, relative to the issues before us.\nSome have suggested, though, that we're off to a rocky start here in this evenly divided Senate by having such a contentious hearing. Well, this hearing was not the idea of any Democrat, it happened to be the idea of the founding fathers in Article II, Section 2, when they said it would be the responsibility of the Senate to give advice and consent to the president of the United States in his nominations.\nI don't think that that was a casual reference or surplus verbiage. I think, in fact, they decided very carefully that they would restrain the part of the president and make certain that the chosen leader of our nation would be subject to review in these decisions by another branch of government.\nSenator Ashcroft, on the day, December 22, when President-elect George Bush nominated you to be attorney general, you made a brief statement which many of us have seen, and said at one point, and I quote, \"President-elect Bush, you have my word that I will administer the Department of Justice with integrity, I will advise your administration with integrity, and I will enforce the laws of the United States of America with integrity.\"\nIntegrity, by common definition, is a unwavering commitment to a set of values. There is no quarrel that your public life shows a commitment to a set of values. There is no doubt that your service as attorney general will be guided by a set of values.\nThe question before this committee is, what will those values be? Will they be the values embodied in the laws of the land, many of which you have publicly opposed: a woman's right to choose, sensible gun control, civil rights laws, human rights protections? Will they be the values of President-elect Bush and Vice President-elect Cheney, many of which differ from your own public record? Will they be your values, the values in your heart, which have guided you throughout your public life?\nThe role of the attorney general, as described in the definition of the Department of Justice, first to enforce the law, and that is fairly obvious. And in conclusion, it says to ensure, quote, \"the fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\"\nCan you guarantee fair and impartial administration of justice if you believe some Americans are undeserving or engaged in conduct which you find morally objectionable?\nAs sound as America's principles may be, we must concede that we are not a perfect people. We have struggled throughout our history with issues of equality for women, African-Americans, Hispanics, new Americans, the disabled, people of diverse religious belief, people with different sexual orientation.\nThis last election has left America divided, and I know that the new president has suggested that he wants to unite this great nation. And I sincerely hope that he can.\nHe knows that his biggest challenge will be to reach out and win the confidence of many who opposed him--families and women and minorities and new Americans and those concerned that his views are outside the mainstream of American values. And no office has a more direct impact on the lives and fortunes of these groups and all Americans, for that matter, than the office of attorney general.\nIf minority voters feel disenfranchised by backward election technology and politically biased oversight, it's the attorney general who must protect their rights. If women feel their reproductive choices, including their right to choose the best family planning for them, is threatened by violent demonstrators, it's the attorney general who must protect them. If those with different sexual orientation feel the pain of discrimination and threat of bodily harm, it is the attorney general and the Department of Justice who must protect them.\nSenator Ashcroft, several weeks ago you and I were on an airplane together, you with your wife and I went alone to the funeral of former Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan.\nIt was a wonderful gesture on your part to be there, considering the fact that you were in the midst of a campaign. It was a funeral service that I will long remember.\nAt the end of that service, as I was leaving, someone pointed to me and said, \"Senator Durbin, this group over here is the Missouri Supreme Court.\"\nAnd I said, \"Is Justice Ronnie White among them?\"\nThey said, \"Yes, he's the gentleman standing over here.\"\nAnd I went over and met him for the first time and introduced myself. And I said, \"I'm Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, and you're Justice Ronnie White, are you not?\"\nHe said, \"Yes.\"\nAnd, Senator Ashcroft, I said to him, \"I want to apologize to you for what happened on the floor on the United States Senate. That never should have happened.\"\nHe faced an embarrassment and a humiliation on the floor of the Senate which did not have to happen. If there was a heartfelt belief by the senators from Missouri that he should not have been a federal district court judge, it should never have reached that point in time. And it rarely ever does in the history of the United States Senate.\nI have said to you personally and I will say to you at this hearing, I'm going to be asking you a number of questions about that decision and about the process and the way this man was treated. I think that is going to tell me a great deal about your conduct if you become attorney general.\nDuring the course of this hearing, Senator Ashcroft will be given a chance to explain his vision of the office, to reconcile clear conflicts between his public record and the new responsibilities he seeks, and to give us and America a chance to look into his heart. This open, fair hearing is an opportunity which was often denied to many who sought the approval of this committee, but it is an opportunity which you will have.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nAnd we will put Senator Cantwell's statement also in the record. As I said, she's at former colleague Senator Cranston's funeral.\nAnd I would recognize the distinguished senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions.\nSESSIONS: I thank the chairman.\nJohn, welcome to the pit. Those were the words of Alan Simpson, I believe, when Justice Scalia appeared here. And it's not a pleasant place to be. There are effective organized groups. One of the members said they are a seasoned coalition. There is a seasoned group that knows how to tarnish individuals who come before a committee when they want to.\nAnd as Senator DeWine noted, you, indeed, have a long and distinguished career that includes a lot of litigation and a lot of positions that you've taken, as you believed was right, and there's somebody that can complain about a lot of that. And I hope the burden of proof has not shifted; that wouldn't be appropriate, but it would be consistent with what Senator Simpson said in this committee once that we're more like prosecutor and accused than a confirmation hearing.\nWell, I love the Department of Justice. I spent 15 years in the department as an assistant United States attorney, 12 years as United States attorney, served five different attorneys general. I believe in that department. It is a great department. It is the Department of Justice and, frankly, we may have had an attorney general who was right on some of our colleagues' ideological issues, but I don't think the department has run well. I think there's some problems there. I think it needs new, vigorous, positive leadership and as people have described your background, I think you're perfect for that and I'm honored to support you.\nI don't expect anything to come out that would change my mind. Certainly the things that have come out that I have seen and studied are insignificant--differences of opinion that we might have that should not change our view about your qualifications.\nThe attorney general is a law enforcer. There is a big difference between a politician and a senator, where we vote on policy, and executing policy. To me, I haven't had much difficulty making the switch from prosecutor, professional career, attorney general in Alabama to the--actually, I may have had more problem than you're going to have going back.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut there is a difference and it's pretty cleared in our minds. And I think, as an eight-year attorney general, you'll not have any difference problem going back and enforcing the law as written.\nI would say this: I was surprised, Senator Specter, that John supported Chuck Schumer's bankruptcy bill. I tried my best to stop that amendment and I didn't know you had voted the other way on that, but it was...\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: You're going to have plenty of time to let him know how you think about that.\nSESSIONS: But I don't think the attorney general is particularly unique in setting policy.\nHHS people, they set policy about whole kinds of contraceptives, very sensitive issues and health issues. There are sensitive issues in Labor that the labor secretary gets to set. I'm not sure the attorney general gets to set many issues at all; basically just has to carry out the laws that are set.\nI do think bipartisanship is important. I support President Bush's commitment to bipartisanship. I'm going to try to do better this time.\nI supported Trent Lott in trying to reach an agreement that we wouldn't be fighting here in the beginning of this session, even though some felt maybe it had gone too far. We need to work together. And I think this hearing is a bit of a test.\nThe independent groups, hard-left that they are, have every right to speak and advocate and raise questions. But I think this body needs to evaluate it and give John Ashcroft a fair hearing, in terms of what was known to him, what was the circumstances when he made these decisions, and not take them out of context and give it a spin that's unfair to him. All of us have done things, if taken out of context and twisted about, could be an honest statement, but be a misrepresentation of what's happening.\nJohn has not been an obstructionist here. I've looked at the numbers. He voted for 95 percent of President Clinton's judicial nominees. He voted for 26 of 27 African-Americans; the only one that was raised, Ronnie White, is the only one he's opposed. And he had a personal and good reason for that, in my view.\nHe's going to be a champion of prosecution of gun laws. Under this administration prosecutions have dropped. I've talked to John about it. He's committed to me that he's going to work to increase the number of people that are prosecuted for violation of gun laws in America. And in my view, they can be done dramatically with no new resources, frankly.\nAnd on Bill Lann Lee, this committee split on that vote.\nAnd, Chairman Hatch, if you'd like to read a brilliant address on it, read his speech on the floor about why he opposed Bill Lann Lee. That was not a racial thing. It was a serious discussion about his views about whether or not he would actually follow the Adarand Supreme Court decision. The Adarand case, he said he would support, but the way he defined it, in our view, was not an accurate definition of it. So then he would not be enforcing Adarand if he didn't properly understand Adarand. So that was the basis of our opposition there.\nSo I would just say this: I believe that John Ashcroft has all the gifts and graces to make a great attorney general. I believe he will be a great attorney general. I believe he will serve this country with distinction. I believe this department will flourish under his leadership. I know he will be responsive to us if we have problems. I know and he knows who the captain of the ship is, and that's the president, at whose pleasure he serves.\nI believe in John. I think all of us do. I ask each member of this committee: Listen to the complaints, but think about the context, the values he held, ask yourself if he abused his office or did wrong on any significant matter. I don't think you will find that to have occurred. And I would like to see a very strong vote for John Ashcroft for attorney general.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: Thank the senator from Alabama.\nI give it now to my neighbor from New Hampshire, Senator Smith.\nSMITH: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd Senator Ashcroft and Janet, welcome.\nI think Thomas Paine once said, \"These are the times that try men's souls,\" and then he spoke of the sunshine patriots. You're not a sunshine patriot. You're willing to stand here and take it. You don't deserve some of the things that have been said about you and will be said about you. And I know it's tough, but there are a lot of us, I think frankly on both sides of the debate, that appreciate the fact that you're willing to do just that.\nIt is not pleasant for me, as a personal friend of yours--and I will admit that publicly--to hear terms such as racism applied to you, my friend. It's unworthy--those who make the charges. And it's certainly not in the best interest of the political debate of this country.\nSenator Kohl, I believe, a few moments ago said that the attorney general of the United States should be a role model. If I could pick a role model for my two sons, I'd pick John Ashcroft. And I wouldn't hesitate one moment to do just that.\nThroughout his entire career in politics, in his own words, he has sought to bring America to its highest and best. He loves his country, he loves Missouri, he loves his family, he loves the law, and he loves the Constitution. And yes, he loves his God. That's not a disqualifier; that's a qualifier. That's not a divider; that's a uniter.\nThere's a lot of cynicism in this town. And people think there's too much politics in politics. We've heard some of it in the public debate leading up to this hearing. We'll hear some of it, and we've already heard some of it in the hearing.\nBut John Ashcroft is a guy who's always looking to do what is right. I'm reminded, and I think Senator Durbin alluded to it, of John Ashcroft coming in to the Republican Conference after the sudden and tragic death of Governor Mel Carnahan, his opponent; emotionally talking about that in the confines of that room with only his colleagues there; announcing to all of us he would suspend his campaign immediately for at least the next 10 days. While that happened, the other side geared up to defeat him, but John did the right thing.\nThat's the kind of man he is. That's the kind of man he is, so when you hear the criticisms, be reminded of the kind of person that he really is. I've never known him to look at a poll or a focus group to make a decision. He looks to the law, he looks to the Constitution, he looks to the founding fathers.\nAmerica does not need an attorney general who is concerned about public opinion. Americans want an attorney general who is concerned about the law and the Constitution, an attorney general who will not only enforce it, but be an aggressive and vociferous advocate for it and the Constitution.\nPresident-elect Bush could have picked another person for attorney general, but he couldn't have picked a better person for attorney general.\nThere will be witnesses who are going to say that because John Ashcroft is a man of religious faith that he won't enforce the law. On the contrary, I would say that knowing the importance Senator Ashcroft places in his faith, I can't think of anyone I'd place more confidence in to support the law.\nSenator Feingold mentioned a few moments ago that some of the decisions or some of the views that Senator Ashcroft has taken are painful to some on his side. I might also say some of the views that the current attorney general has taken have been painful on our side.\nBut when he puts his hand on the Bible, as Senator Kyl said, and swears to enforce the law, he means it. He'll do it.\nWe're not going to hear much today, except on this side of the table, about the qualifications of Senator John Ashcroft. They've been mentioned a thousand sides, yet I want to say them again: two-term Missouri attorney general; head of the National Association of Attorneys General, receiving a commendation for that; two-term Missouri governor; head of the National Association of Governors; U.S. senator and former member of this Judiciary Committee. We won't hear a lot about that from the other side, because that's not the issue to them.\nAs a matter of fact, John Ashcroft may be the most qualified candidate ever nominated for attorney general. Again, we're not going to be focusing on those qualifications from the other side.\nIn 1993, Janet Reno said, quote, \"The only reason for the death penalty is vengeance. What I want is to put the bad people away and keep them away.\" A strong statement from the attorney general, opposed to the death penalty, but Janet Reno applied the law of the land, which is the death penalty.\nThere's no fear here.\nIn conclusion, President-elect George Bush has chosen a like-minded conservative to serve as his U.S. attorney general. We should respect that choice, as has been said here, just as Republicans, by a vote of 98 to 0, confirmed Janet Reno.\nAnd I'll say to my colleagues, if it is painful, if I can vote for Janet Reno, you can vote for John Ashcroft.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAgain, Mr. Chairman, let us set aside the mud slinging, set aside the rhetoric. This is a decent, honorable man. Let's focus on the qualifications on John Ashcroft to be the next U.S. attorney general.\nMy friend, they're going to put you down a bumpy road; there's no question about it. But you've got good shock absorbers. And you're bigger than the politics of self-destruction. Handle it well, as I know you will.\nAnd the American people, once they know who you are, once they get to know you, they'll be with you.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: I thank the senator from New Hampshire. And I do want, if he is feeling as badly about voting for Attorney General Reno, at least he has the satisfaction of knowing that while the national crime rate went up for the 12 years before she came there, it went down for the eight years she was there. So that will give you a chance to point to a very good accomplishment.\nHaving said that...\nSESSIONS: It didn't go down all those years. Just a few, about 12 years before.\nLEAHY: Didn't go down any before...\nSESSIONS: Yes, it did.\nHATCH: Enough said.\nSESSIONS: I'll show you the numbers.\nLEAHY: Well, we can...\nSESSIONS: I was there.\nLEAHY: Well, maybe when you were U.S. attorney.\nHATCH: It's going to go down a heck of a lot more under Attorney General Ashcroft. I guarantee you that.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: I wish you'd stop delaying this, Senator Hatch. We got to get going with this.\nAnd now, I welcome, again, the distinguished senator from Kansas, who is a friend to all of us in this body, and delighted to have him here in the committee and please go ahead.\nBROWNBACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And it's a pleasure to join this committee. I look forward to serving on it and important issues that come here and before this committee. And this is one of them.\nJohn, welcome, and Janet, delighted to have you folks here. I'm looking forward to your confirmation as attorney general and your serving with distinction in that capacity, as you have every place else you've served in your long public career that you have had thus far.\nAs a personal note, you know, they say a true friend is somebody who will give you the shirt off their back. I was in my apartment complex I was, in town, was in a fire this last year. And I was standing out in the streets with not much else that I got out with. And the Ashcroft's came over and gave me a roof over my head for several days and took me in. And unlike Senator Feingold's experience driving, I would put you as Secretary of HUD in a moment.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHousing was excellent, wonderful accommodations. And they were very kind. And I would dare say, they would do that for anybody in this room, not just me. That's the kind of people that John and Janet Ashcroft are. And I had a personal experience, and I deeply appreciate that kindness you showed me then and you have all along.\nOur states share a common border. We served on two committees together, in the Commerce and Foreign Relations Committee. Our offices are just down the hall from each other. So we've had a chance to work on a lot of things together.\nBut, really, much more important than either geography or committee assignments, John has shared with me, through his life through the things that he has done, through what I've observed, what I've seen, what I've talked with him about: his honesty, his integrity, his devotion to his family and to his creator, his principled character and his steadfast belief that each of us, each of us is put here on Earth to help our fellow man and to leave this world a better place for all of our children, for those here now and those yet to be.\nAnd contrary to the assertions of those who make a living exacerbating the tensions that divide us as a nation, I know John Ashcroft is committed to our nation's promise of equal justice for all, no matter what their stage of life.\nHe has been an outstanding public servant, an example of public service that many of us in this dais would be proud to have.\nNow in the Constitution, Article II, Section 3 provides that the president, quote, \"shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" end of quote. I'm certain John has already read that provision many, many times.\nJohn, when President-elect Bush nominated you to head the Department of Justice he stated that he believed in your, quote, \"commitment to fair and firm and impartial administration of justice.\" When you accepted President-elect Bush's nomination, you reaffirmed for the world to hear, your commitment to equal justice under the law, something you've served your entire life with distinction and will continue to do so.\nMr. Chairman, let me close my brief statement by saying to our guests at the witness table that, John, you're missed here in the Senate, you really are. But I look forward to voting for your confirmation and towards working with you as attorney general of the United States, and you're going to do an outstanding job. Thanks.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nI see no other senators have statements to make. We will take a 10-minute break.\nBefore everybody leaves, there are a lot of people who want to come in. If there's anybody who is--I say this without a great deal of expectation--but if there are those who wish to leave and give their seats to others, there are those available to take the seats. I mention this because we will have closed circuit TV in Dirksen 226, with chairs and so forth.\nWith that, we'll stand in recess.\n(RECESS)\nLEAHY: So we can understand where we stand before we go to Senator Ashcroft's testimony, we will first have three distinguished senators who are here, who I wish to introduce them.\nAnd following tradition, as he is from Missouri, we'll go first to the senior senator from Missouri, Senator Bond.\nSEN. BOND: Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I might defer to the other members of the panel for their first introductions, and I would be happy to relinquish my spot and follow as the third and least of the introducers.\nLEAHY: And the senator, of course, has that right. I thank him for his courtesy, and then we'll go to Senator Carnahan as the other senator from Missouri.\nSEN. CARNAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch. Three months ago this very day I could not possibly have imagined that I would be here. And I suspect that Senator Ashcroft could say the same.\nDuring the time that John Ashcroft served the state of Missouri, my late husband, Mel Carnahan, also served in public life as state treasurer, lieutenant governor and governor. So I have an appreciation for the many burdens that Senator Ashcroft and Janet and his family have had to bear in order to serve.\nNow a new burden rests upon his shoulders and upon each member of the United States Senate. We are considering the nomination of Mr. Ashcroft to be the attorney general of the United States, one of the most powerful and sensitive offices in the nation. I urge you to show him fairness but not favoritism, to welcome all of the facts without fear, and to base your decision on principle and not partisanship.\nI ask you to look beyond any history of friendship or disputes, and to look beyond the bonds or divisions of party, and to look beyond the urging of interest groups expressing either support or opposition to this nomination. Instead, let us base our decision on the facts as they are determined by a full and fair hearing. I believe that is how we can best serve the interests of the people of America.\nMr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, as a proud resident of the Show Me state and a member of this esteemed body, I come here today to introduce to you my fellow Missourian, John David Ashcroft.\nThank you.\nLEAHY: Thank you very much, Senator.\nAnd Senator Hutchison? Following our regional procedure, we will go to you, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.\nSEN. HUTCHISON: Thank you, Chairman Leahy, Chairman Hatch and other members of this committee.\nI'm pleased to be here in support of my good friend, former Senator John Ashcroft, whom I've known for many years before he became my colleague. In fact, I was in Kansas City with him and Janet when he had his first press conference after suspending his campaign for the United States Senate for 10 days out of respect for his deceased opponent. The people of America saw the true heart of John Ashcroft in the way he handled the tragic death of Mel Carnahan. He showed magnanimity in his defeat. He put the people of Missouri before his own self-interest.\nMr. Chairman, I think he will do the same for the people of America as attorney general of the United States.\nJohn and I have served together for six years. He brings an impressive background which all of you have heard several times today. I also think it is worth mentioning, because I think it adds to the integrity of this family, to mention his wonderful wife Janet, who has spent the last five years showing her commitment to education and diversity by teaching at one of our great historically black colleges, Howard University.\nSenator Ashcroft and I have worked together on many issues and I want to mention a few of those here because he was a leader. He was a leader in co-sponsoring my legislation to eliminate the marriage tax penalty which has the effect of taxing many women at higher rates when the enter the workplace. Last year, he and I worked together to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. He and I both introduced legislation to amend the current stalking laws to make it a crime to stalk someone via electronic means such as the Internet. This new criminal law is now in place.\nJohn led the effort to allow hourly wage earners, particularly working mothers, the ability to craft flexible work schedules to better meet the demands of both job and family. While in the Senate, John Ashcroft voted to prohibit people convicted of domestic violence from owning a firearm.\nJohn also took a very important issue increasing the rights of victims.\nWhile he was governor, he enacted a victim's rights law in Missouri, and has been a staunch co-sponsor with Senator Kyl on the victim's right constitutional amendment, along with Senator Feinstein.\nAlso while governor, he appointed the first women to the Missouri Supreme Court.\nSo I would say to this committee, maybe you might not agree with John Ashcroft on every issue, I think there will be legitimate philosophical differences between Congress and the executive branch, but as I have heard all of the opening statements today, there has been no question whatsoever of John Ashcroft's qualifications, his experience for this job and his absolute total integrity.\nOn the question of enforcing the law, I don't think there's any question that John Ashcroft will uphold and enforce all the laws of our country, and do it vigorously.\nSo in nominating John Ashcroft, President-elect Bush has made his choice. And I believe the Congress should respect the new president's decision.\nI am pleased to be here, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on behalf of my former colleague, a person for whom I have great respect.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator Hutchison. And I appreciate you taking the time to be here.\nAnd, Senator Bond, we'll go now to you, please.\nBOND: Mr. Chairman, ranking minority member, temporarily, Senator Hatch...\n(LAUGHTER)\nHATCH: We want you to repeat the \"temporarily,\" Kit.\nBOND: ... temporarily, Senator Hatch, if I may submit my full statement to the record, I'll try to summarize it, because I have a good bit to say about the man I'm honored to present today, President-elect Bush's nominee for attorney general.\nIt's a proud day for me, for the state of Missouri, and for this body. As a well-respected former member of this body, John Ashcroft doesn't need to be introduced to you.\nI go back to 1973.\nI had the responsibility to appoint a state auditor for Missouri, and based upon what I saw as promise in John Ashcroft, his character, intelligence and commitment to public service, I selected him. For 28 years I have watched him work every day in the best and highest traditions of this country. Those of you who work with him in the Senate have had an opportunity to see that.\nIf you were to ask me one word to describe John Ashcroft, it would be \"integrity.\" And integrity means a steadfast adherence to a strict moral or ethical code. And I'm saying to my colleagues on the committee, that code subsumes within it the adherence to the Constitution and laws. Throughout John Ashcroft's career as attorney general and governor, he has done that.\nBut in this new position, I can think of no one better to be the chief law enforcement agent of this country. He believes in strong and fair law enforcement. He has a consistently strong record on law enforcement, and it's supported by those on the frontlines of law enforcement.\nIf you would permit me, Mr. Chairman, I wish to recognize Mary Ann Vevrett (ph), chief of police for Gaithersburg, Maryland, who is here today on behalf of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, 18,000 members strong, who know firsthand how crucial it is to have the support of someone like John Ashcroft in the attorney general's office. They are behind John. And I thank you very much, Chief.\nMr. Chairman, in recent weeks we've seen self-described proponents of various activist groups, trying to convince senators that there is a different John Ashcroft than the man we know personally. Like a sidewalk con-artist, these groups are asking senators, \"Who are you going to believe, me or your own lying eyes?\" Well, they're asking members of this body to embrace the caricature of John Ashcroft over senators' own close knowledge of the man's fine record, built in this committee and on the Senate floor.\nI've been disappointed in some of the things that I've heard said about John Ashcroft; slash and attack methods are something we've seen far too often in Washington, and I believe the American people are sick and tired of it.\nNevertheless, there are legitimate questions that can and should be raised. And several members of the committee have raised the reasonable question of whether John Ashcroft can be trusted to enforce laws with which he personally disagrees.\nWell, I'm here to tell you that I have observed him, and I can give you the Missouri \"show me\" test. He will enforce the laws.\nWe can assume that most, if not all, United States attorneys general have disagreed with some of the laws they were charged with enforcing. But why is it now that John Ashcroft, a conservative and committed Christian, is charged by some extreme groups of special interest that he would somehow be unable to enforce the laws because of his beliefs? I see some elements of religious bigotry in that.\nJohn Ashcroft has stated and repeated firmly that he believes his religion teaches him that he should not impose his religious beliefs on anybody else. He has, however, sought, as we all have, to change the law where he deeply believes it was inadequate or wrong.\nUndoubtedly, every member of this committee can find votes cast or positions taken by John Ashcroft with which we disagree. I certainly can. Obviously, some of you find many issues on which you disagree legislatively with John Ashcroft.\nBut that is not the point. When you look at the record, you'll see that John Ashcroft believes in enforcing the law as it stands.\nAs Missouri's attorney general, he was my lawyer when I was governor. In 1981, despite his opposition to abortion, he issued an opinion in which he ruled that the Missouri Division of Health could not release to the public information on the number of abortions performed by particular hospitals.\nDespite his personal view that life begins at conception, he issued an opinion that Missouri law did not require a certificate of death if a fetus was 20 weeks old or less.\nDespite his own personal commitment to the distribution of Bibles and other religious materials, he issued an attorney general's opinion in 1979 that a board of education has no legal authority to grant permission to any organization to distribute religious material to any or all the student body on school property.\nAlthough he stated his opposition to racial set-asides, he issued an opinion in 1980 that allowed the Missouri Clean Water Commission to award a 15 percent state grant to the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District to establish a minority business enterprise program.\nThe John Ashcroft you and I know will be a good attorney general. I can think of no nominee who is better qualified. Senator Kyl and many of you have already spoken about the qualifications. I must say, in deep regret, that the characterization of John Ashcroft's record by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts is flat, simply wrong. That is not the person that we in Missouri know and respect.\nJohn Ashcroft will and can continue to serve this nation with distinction. He knows the legislator's job is to write the laws and the attorney general's job is to enforce it. The American people have a right to expect something better than an attorney general who bends the law to serve a president's political needs and personal views. I know John Ashcroft would never engage in such behavior. He will faithfully, fairly, and effectively administer the laws of this great land. He is not one to bend the laws to his personal beliefs.\nI come before this committee and respectfully asks that John Ashcroft's nomination to be attorney general be judged on the basis of the content of his character and that charges against him which are personal and insubstantial be dismissed, and this committee and that the full body confirm him as United States attorney general.\nSEN. KENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what Senator Bond has mentioned. I'll come back during the question period and we'll have an opportunity to have an exchange with the nominee.\nLEAHY: What the senator wants is somewhat extraordinary for somebody introducing somebody to take issue with an opening statement of a senator on the panel. I would give opportunity for you to respond now, if you want it, but if not, it's up to you.\nKENNEDY: I'd be happy to. We'll wait until the question period.\nLEAHY: Why don't we do this? I think all three of the introducers, and I'll let you leave and maybe the staff can move this around a little bit so that Senator Ashcroft could sit in the center, move the name tags around the rest.\nI thank Senator Hutchison, Senator Carnahan and Senator Bond, I thank you for being here.\nSenator Ashcroft, will you please stand to be sworn?\nDo you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\nJOHN ASHCROFT: I do.\nLEAHY: Please be seated.\nAnd Senator Ashcroft, before you begin your statement, it's been mentioned several times that you have family and friends here. Would you like--following our normal procedure at these things--to point out family or members or others you may wish to in the audience?\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, if it pleases the committee, I will make that part of my opening remarks.\nLEAHY: It's totally your choice. Go ahead.\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, members of the committee.\nTHURMOND: Will you speak in your loudspeaker?\nASHCROFT: Yes, Senator Thurmond, I will. Thank you very much.\n(UNKNOWN): You should know that by now, John.\n(LAUGHTER)\nASHCROFT: It's a case of how soon we forget. What struck me most is that I came here, and I had a distinct and clear signal that being out of the Senate is different because each other member of the Senate was designated as honorable, and I'm just designated as senator. And I'm just trying to figure what the difference is between being honorable and being a senator.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: Be careful, you may lose some votes over here.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHATCH: I don't think so.\nASHCROFT: Thank you. It is a high honor for me to appear before you today for consideration as the attorney general of the United States of America.\nI first want to extend my appreciation to the senators from my home state of Missouri, Senators Bond and Carnahan, for the courtesy and kindness of participating in an introduction for me at this committee today.\nAnd, of course, it's most pleasing that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas would join them by adding introductory remarks on my behalf. I extend to her my sincere appreciation as well.\nFor four years, I had the privilege of sitting with you on this committee. During that time, I never thought of it simply as the Judiciary Committee.\nInstead, I thought of it being the Justice Committee, for this distinguished body is the ultimate legislative voice on American justice. It was an honor to serve with you in that noble endeavor.\nToday, I'm here in a far different capacity: President-elect George W. Bush has designated me to lead the Justice Department, the principal executive voice on American justice and what must be, should be and continue to be the role model for justice the world over.\nIt's not only with honor, therefore, that I sit before you today, it's with an awesome sense of responsibility. For I know that if confirmed on my shoulders will rest the responsibility of upholding American justice, a tradition that strives to bring protection to the weak, freedom to the restrained--I wasn't going to introduce my grandson, Jimmy, at this point...\n(LAUGHTER)\nJimmy, what you've got going for you is there are a lot of grandparents on this panel, so.\nHe upstages me around the house, too. I'm not what I used to be.\nOur tradition in the Justice Department that strives to bring protection to the weak, and freedom to the restrained, liberty to the oppressed, and security to every citizen.\nMine will be the same mantle carried by my predecessors, by Edmund Randolph, President George Washington's choice to be America's first attorney general; by Robert Kennedy, who found within himself the courage to surmount America's historic racial intolerance and to lend powerful assistance to the burgeoning civil rights movement.\nI understand the responsibility of the attorney general's office. I revere it. I am humbled by it. And if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as the attorney general, I will spend every waking moment, and probably some sleeping moments as well, dedicated to ensuring that the Justice Department lives up to its heritage, not only enforcing the rule of law, but guaranteeing rights for the advancement of all Americans.\nThe attorney general must recognize this: The language of justice is not the reality of justice for all Americans.\nMy wife has helped me with anecdotes of hers from her experience to understand that there are millions of Americans who wonder if justice means hostility aimed at \"just us.\" From racial profiling to news of unwarranted strip searches, the list of injustice in America today is still long. Injustice in America against any individual must not stand; this is the special charge of the U.S. Department of Justice.\nNo American should be turned away from a polling place because of the color of her skin or the sound of his name. No American should be denied access to public accommodations or a job as a result of a disability. No American family should be prevented from realizing the dream of home ownership in the neighborhood of their choice just because of skin color. No American should have the door to employment or educational opportunity slammed shut because of gender or race. No American should fear being stopped by police just because of skin color. And no woman should fear being threatened or coerced in seeking constitutionally protected health services.\nI pledge to you that if I'm confirmed as attorney general, the Justice Department will meet its special charge. Injustice against individuals will not stand, no ifs, ands or buts, period.\nThe attorney general is charged with the solemn responsibility of serving as the attorney for the United States of America. The attorney general is the people's counsel. The attorney general must lead a professional, nonpartisan Justice Department that is uncompromisingly fair, defined by integrity and dedicated to upholding the rule of law.\nI pledge to you that if I am confirmed as attorney general I will serve as the attorney general of all the people.\nToday, I'd like to spend a few minutes telling you a bit about myself and my family and my beliefs. I am the grandson of immigrants. My father was a pastor and a college president. I was raised in Springfield, Missouri, in a home where all of God's children were welcome. In fact, my parents gave up their bed so many times that I thought that they actually knew all of God's children who came to visit. That lesson of hospitality and generosity was just one of many my parents urged on me.\nI went to Yale University, where I dreamed of playing quarterback. When I got there, I discovered that either I was slow or everybody else was really fast. So I studied hard and I was fortunate enough to graduate and then attend the University of Chicago Law School.\nFor me, the law was about the promise of justice, the promise that under law, all men, all women, all people are equal.\nWhile in Chicago, however, I did find one person I thought a little more equal than all the others, a woman of grace and charm and intellect and not insignificantly to me, as a young man, a woman that I thought was the most beautiful I'd ever seen. Only thing better than her, I thought, would be two of them.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAfter rebuffing me several times, my persistence overcame her better judgment and she has stuck with me for 33 years. And members of the committee, her name is Janet Ashcroft. I'm privileged to have her with me today.\nI'm also pleased to tell you she is an accomplished legal author and has spent the last five years teaching law in the Business Department of Howard University, here in Washington, D.C. I'm also pleased, as well, to welcome her identical twin sister--they're not as identical as they used to be, but I could always tell them apart--Ann Giddings (ph), to the hearing today.\nTHURMOND: Tell her to raise her hand.\nASHCROFT: Yes.\n(LAUGHTER)\nASHCROFT: Would the real Janet Ashcroft please stand up?\n(APPLAUSE)\nASHCROFT: And Ann (ph), would you stand up with your sister, please? Thank you.\nAnd I also wanted to introduce my daughter, Martha Grace Patterson (ph), who is an attorney from Kansas City--attorney and mother. My grandson, Jimmy Patterson, who has already made his presence known to you.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI regret that my eldest son, John Robert Ashcroft, whose faculty responsibilities at Forest Park Community College in St. Louis require his presence with students and cannot be with us today. Additionally, I regret that active duty responsibilities of my son, Andrew David Ashcroft, in the United States Navy, make impossible his attendance at this hearing.\nI'm grateful for my family, they are wonderful people. They are not wonderful because of me, they are wonderful in spite of me. They are wonderful, a support and help to me. I thank God for them.\nUpon graduating from law school, I returned to Missouri where I taught business law at Southwest Missouri State University. And after five years of teaching, I embarked on a quarter-century career in public service serving the people of Missouri.\nIn 1973, the then-governor, Kit Bond, appointed me as state auditor. Two years later, then-attorney general, Jack Danforth, appointed me assistant attorney general. I could not have had two more accomplished and distinguished mentors in public life than Jack and Kit.\nBeginning in 1976, I was elected to the two terms as attorney general, then two terms as governor and, unfortunately--well, pardon me, just one term as the United States senator.\nIn the course of the six state-wide election campaigns, I came to know the people of Missouri very well. Missouri is representative of the rich diversity of the American people. The people of the Show Me state respond to the plain-spoken honesty and tolerance of men like Jack and Kit and, of course, Harry Truman. I'm pleased they elected me to state-wide office five times.\nEighteen years of my service in elective office have been focused on enforcing the law, six years enacting the law. I know the difference between enactment and enforcement, and my record shows that.\nI am here today as the attorney general-designate, I know what the office requires. I've been an attorney general before. I understand that being attorney general means enforcing the laws as they are written, not enforcing my own personal preference; it means advancing the national interest, not advocating my personal interest.\nFor example, in 1979, I issued an attorney general's opinion stating that under the state constitution and the law of Missouri, a local school board of education had no legal authority to grant permission for the distribution of religious publications to the student body on public school grounds.\nOn another occasion, contrary to the demands of pro-life advocates, I directed the state government of Missouri to maintain the confidentiality of abortion records because a fair reading of the law required it.\nThroughout my tenure, I did my level best to enforce fully and faithfully the laws as they were written and to protect the legal interests of the state of Missouri when it was attacked and when the institutions of the state were attacked.\nI did this without regard to any personal policy preferences. And when I left the attorney general's office, Missouri was a state more committed to fairness and justice.\nFrom my experience, I also understand that the citizens' paramount civil right is safety.\nAmericans have the right to be secure in their persons, in their homes and in their communities. Gun violence, violence against women, drug crime, sexual predators, they all threaten to deny this most fundamental of rights to be secure in the person, property and community of individuals.\nIt is a core responsibility that government, led by the attorney general and the Department of Justice, cooperating with local law enforcement officials, will secure this right.\nChildren don't learn in schools overrun by neighborhood violence. Jobs will not be found in communities where criminals own the streets. No American who now feels threatened should have to move in order to live in a safer neighborhood.\nMy record on these issues is clear and unmistakable and my determination is unwavering. I will continue to work to deter and punish violent criminals who use guns. I will vigorously enforce federal domestic violence laws and utilize the Violence Against Women Act to assist states in this effort. Likewise, we will put new vigor into the fight against the illegal drug organizations and redouble our vigilance against terrorists.\nDuring my service as both state attorney general and governor, we increased the number of full-time law enforcement officers by over 60 percent. We also lengthened prison sentences for criminals and significantly increased juvenile prosecutions for serious crimes. During my tenure as governor, we won passage for a Missouri victim's bill of rights. We secured $100 million in increased funding to combat violence against women. We also increased funding for anti-drug programs by almost 40 percent and 3/4 of that went for education, prevention and for treatment.\nAs a senator, I voted to deny the right to bear arms to those convicted of domestic violence. I supported increased funding for victims and helped enact legislation combating telemarketing scams against seniors. I supported mandatory background checks for gun show sales and increased federal funds for law enforcement at the local level. I've always been pleased by my support from law enforcement officers. Those who are here today--for whom I am grateful and those who in past times have endorsed me, most recently in my campaign for the Senate, by the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs and the St. Louis Police Officer's Association.\nOn the strength of this record and my commitment to the personal security and safety of the people of the United States of America, I pledge my commitment to secure the rights of all Americans to safety and security in their daily lives.\nI also know from my service that a successful attorney general must be able to listen and find common ground with leaders of diversely held viewpoints. Few organizations reflect the diversity and strongly held views as much as the bipartisan National Association of Attorneys General.\nI was honored when my fellow state attorneys general elected me president of that associate. I was humbled when they recognized me for outstanding service and presented me with the distinguished Wyeman (ph) Award.\nI was similarly honored when the bipartisan National Governor's Association elected me to serve as their chairman.\nI know something about the role of an attorney general. As I said earlier, the Justice Department has a special charge to protect the most vulnerable in our society from injustice. I take pride in my record of having vigorously enforced the civil rights laws as attorney general and governor.\nNot only did I enforce the law, I took proactive steps to expand opportunity. I signed Missouri's first hate crime statute. By executive order, I made Missouri one of the first states to recognize Martin Luther King Day. I lead the fight to save Lincoln University, the Missouri University founded by African-American Civil War veterans. I took special care to expand racial and gender diversity in Missouri's courts. I appointed more African-American judges to the bench than any governor in Missouri history, including appointing the first African-American on the Western District Court of Appeals and the first African-American woman to the St. Louis County Circuit Court.\nIt was my to appoint the first two women to the Missouri Courts of Appeals and the first woman to the Missouri State Supreme Court, the only woman ever to have been appointed to that court.\nNo part of the Department of Justice is more important than the Civil Rights Division. I look forward to the president's appointment, with your advice and consent, of a talented and dedicated leader of that division. It is essential that such strong leadership pursue fair treatment for all Americans.\nBefore leaving the topic of civil rights, I want to address an issue that has been raised in the weeks since President Bush nominated me to this post. Some have suggested that my opposition to the appointment of Judge Ronnie White, an African-American Missouri Supreme Court judge, to a lifetime term on the federal bench was based on something other than my own honest assessment of his qualifications for the post.\nDuring my eight years as governor, I was the appointing authority for judges. As I have just noted, I exercised the power with special care to promote racial diversity on the Missouri state court bench. Because of my experience as governor, when I became senator I approached the judicial confirmation process with both the appropriate deference due an executive and also a personal commitment to ensuring diversity on the bench.\nOf the approximately 1,686 Clinton presidential nominees, both judicial and nonjudicial, voted on by the Senate, I voted to confirm all but 15. I voted to approve every Cabinet nomination made by the president of the United States.\nOf President Clinton's 230 judicial nominees, I voted to confirm 218 of them. Perhaps it is needless to say, but I had philosophic disagreements with many, if not most of those judicial nominees. But I think the record of votes stands for itself.\nOn the floor of this body, I voted to confirm 26 out of 27 African-American judicial nominees. My opposition to Judge Ronnie White was well-founded. Studying his judicial record, considering the implications of his decisions, and hearing the widespread objections to his appointment from a large body of my constituents, I simply came to the overwhelming conclusion that Judge White should not be given lifetime tenure as a U.S. district court judge.\nMy legal review revealed a troubling pattern of his willingness to modify settled law in criminal cases; 53 of my colleagues reached the same conclusion. While I will not take time during my brief opening statement to discuss particular matters in Judge White's record that compelled me to my decision, I welcome the opportunity to discuss those matters later.\nAnother issue merits specific mention in these opening remarks, and that is the issue that we would identify with the case of Roe v. Wade, which established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. As is well known, consistent with Republican United States attorneys general before me, I believe Roe v. Wade, as an original matter, was wrongly decided. I am personally opposed to abortion.\nBut as I have explained this afternoon, I well understand that the role of attorney general is to enforce the law as it is, not as I would have it. I accept Roe and Casey as the settled law of the land. If confirmed as attorney general, I will follow the law in this area and in all other areas. The Supreme Court's decisions on this have been multiple, they have been recent and they have been emphatic.\nI have been entrusted with public service for more than 25 years. It's a responsibility I have honored and a trust that, I believe, I have kept. During those years, I have not thought of myself as a public servant of some of the people, but a keeper of the public trust for all the people. If I become United States attorney general, I, again, commit to enforcing the law, all of the law for all of the people.\nI appear here today as a man of faith, a man of common sense conservative beliefs, a man resolutely committed to the American idea. On occasion, some of you have disagreed with my views. You have done so respectfully, and I thank you. In turn, I hope that my disagreements with you have reciprocated your respect.\nBut whether we are conservatives or liberals, religious or secular, Republicans or Democrats, what we have in common is far greater and more important than what divides us. As Americans, we live under a Constitution, uniting us under a rule of law, a Constitution that allows us to live side by side in harmony, working for the mutual interest of all Americans and our communities.\nIt is indeed adherence to the rule of law that is the basis of our democracy. Never in the history of the world has any country so thoroughly dedicated itself to respecting laws, for it is in respecting laws that we respect the individual dignity and freedom of people. Nowhere in government is thorough obedience to the rule of law more powerfully evident and more urgently necessary than at the Department of Justice.\nIf I am fortunate enough to be confirmed by the United States Senate and to become the next United States attorney general, I pledge to you that strict enforcement of the rule of law will be the cornerstone of justice.\nAs a man of faith, I take my word and my integrity seriously. So when I swear to uphold the law, I will keep my oath, so help me God.\nLEAHY: Thank you, Senator.\nWhat we will do now, we will have in the first round of questioning...\n(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE)\nLEAHY: The committee will be in order. The committee will stand in recess until the police can restore order.\nOfficer, restore order.\nThe police will restore order.\n(CROSSTALK)\nLEAHY: The committee will also stay in order.\nIt will be the policy of the chairman to not allow any demonstrations for or against the nominee. You're all guests of the United States Senate. The 100 senators have a duty to vote for or against this nominee.\nWe will make up our mind based on the testimony within this room and the testimony of the nominee. We will not allow demonstrations of any sort. Everybody has a chance to write or call their individual senators for or against Senator Ashcroft. I thank the Capitol Police for restoring order.\nNow, as I was saying, it will be the intent of the committee to have 15-minute rounds of each senator, doing the usual alternating on the first round. If there are further questions, we'll have shorter rounds after that. I have told the nominee if at any time he wants a break, of course, we will take one, again following normal time.\nSo I will start the questioning, and then we turn to Senator Hatch.\nSenator Ashcroft, while you served in the Senate, you did not have an opportunity to vote on a nomination for attorney general, and, in effect, this is your first hearing that you have attended in any capacity in the Senate for an attorney general. But from 1995 to last year, as you pointed out, you voted for a number of President Clinton's nominees. You also chose to oppose and vote against a number of President Clinton's nominees to the executive branch; in both cases exercising the right any senator has.\nBut I want to explore with you what appears to be the, for want of a better term, the Ashcroft standard that you used when you reviewed presidential nominations, and I'll start with that of Bill Lann Lee.\nYou opposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. In November of 1997, you said, \"This is what I've been sent to Washington to do; to evaluate whether or not an individual will be the kind of an administrator, in an agency, that people are entitled to have.\"\nAnd then you opposed Mr. Lee because, as a civil rights lawyer, you thought, and I quote you again, \"His pursuit of specific objectives that are important to him limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making the judgments that would be necessary for the person who runs that division.\"\nAnd you also said, quote, \"We don't need an individual who is trying to go against the Constitution as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court. We need someone who is going to say, 'I'm here to provide the administration\"'--and that's an actual quote--\"'I'm not here to amend the Constitution; I'm here to defend the Constitution.' That is what we need.\"\nNow, Senator, using this Ashcroft standard, do you adhere to those views as setting the proper standard by which senators should evaluate presidential nominations?\nASHCROFT: Well, I'm pleased, first of all, Mr. Chairman, to thank you for the question. It's an important question. I thank you also for the way you're conducting this hearing. I appreciate the willingness to make sure that we have an opportunity to make these discussions in a setting which is conducive to understanding.\nI think the ability to enforce the law as it is written and as it has been defined by the United States Supreme Court is very important. And when I have evaluated individuals, that's a very important criteria, especially for someone in an administrative or enforcement role and not in an enactment role.\nObviously, in the Senate we take a variety of positions because we--I say advisedly we--I'm no longer a senator, and I don't mean to be presumptive--but because in the debate and in the exchange we arrive at what the law will be.\nI joined with eight other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee in opposing Bill Lee's nomination to be assistant attorney general because I had serious concerns about his willingness to enforce the Adarand decision which was a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court.\nHe was an excellent litigant, but I had concerns that he viewed the Adarand decision as an obstacle rather than as a way in which the law was defined. Adarand held that government programs that establish racial preferences based on race are subject to strict scrutiny, that is the highest level of scrutiny under the Supreme Court's equal protection clause. Adarand was a landmark decision, it was substantial, it was important. Mr. Lee did not indicate a clear willingness to enforce the law based on that decision.\nLEAHY: In the last part, if I could disagree with you on that. Mr. Lee testified on a number of occasions--in fact, testified under oath, including, incidentally directly in answer to your questions, that he would enforce the law as declared in Adarand.\nAnd he also said, in direct answer to questions of this committee, he considered the Adarand decision of the Supreme Court as the controlling legal authority of the land, that he would seek to enforce it, he would give it full effect, but you say that he would not accept that decision and apply it fairly.\nWas Bill Lann Lee lying under oath to this committee?\nASHCROFT: I certainly don't want to say that. I simply want to say that when asked what the standard was, he did not repeat the strict scrutiny standard of \"narrowly tailored and directly related.\"\nLEAHY: But how could he be more strict...\nASHCROFT: He stated another standard, and when asked whether the standard which he applied would affect programs, he basically said it wouldn't have any effect on the programs of the federal government. Now in my judgment...\nLEAHY: But he said he would uphold it. I mean, what more could he say?\nASHCROFT: Well, frankly, he could have said that when applying a test, he would use the same test that the Supreme Court of the United States said should be used in strict scrutiny cases.\nAnd, if he had, I believe that people would have been more likely to give credence--when Chairman Hatch--of course, he made an eloquent floor statement about this in speaking on this matter, but when Chairman Hatch delivered his remarks on this matter, I think he made clear what the rest of us felt, that while he said he considered the Adarand decision the law of the land, when he discussed the way in which it was implemented, it was clear that it would be applied in the way that the Supreme Court would require its application.\nLEAHY: OK. Then I understand, as I said, the Ashcroft standard on that, but let's go a little further, let's take another step.\nLike Bill Lann Lee, you have a long history of pursuing specific objectives that are important to you. And I would assume, like he, within the law. But throughout your public life as attorney general and governor of Missouri and as U.S. senator, you have opposed a women's constitutionally protected right to reproductive freedom and choice, even in cases of rape and incest, you have fought voluntary school desegregation, affirmative action and gay rights. When you were running for president in 1998, you were quoted as saying, quote, \"There are voices in the Republican Party today who preach pragmatism, who champion conciliation, who counsel compromise. I stand here today to reject those deceptions.\" Again, your words.\nNow, given that history, you can understand why some might be troubled by it. What assurances can you give us that you would serve as the chief enforcement officer of this country with the kind of balanced view that you acknowledge is necessary for top official in the Department of Justice, the balanced view that you said others must have before you would vote for their confirmation?\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I would like to just have a chance to go back to that list, the litany of things...\nLEAHY: Of course.\nASHCROFT: ... and positions you attributed to me. You said I opposed voluntary desegregation of the schools. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I don't oppose desegregation, I repudiate segregation. I am in favor of integration.\nWhen the state of Missouri was asked to fund, with hundreds of billions of dollars, a program imposed by a federal court...\nLEAHY: Hundreds of billions?\nASHCROFT: Hundreds of millions of dollars, pardon me. I thank you for correcting me. I've been in Washington so long, I've forgot how to say millions. I've just started saying billions.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: I'm more interested in what you said at the time of the desegregation orders in Missouri.\nASHCROFT: I opposed a mandate by the federal government that the state, which had done nothing wrong, found guilty of no wrong, that they should be asked to pay this very substantial sum of money over a long course of years. And that's what I opposed.\nI have always opposed segregation. I have never opposed integration. I believe that segregation is inconsistent with the 14th Amendment's guaranteeing of equal protection. I supported integrating the schools.\nNow, while I was the Missouri attorney general, I inherited a desegregation lawsuit in St. Louis from my predecessor in office, Jack Danforth. The state had been sued. I argued on behalf of the state of Missouri that it could not be found legally liable for segregation in St. Louis schools because the state had never been a party to the litigation.\nNow, one of the responsibilities of an attorney general, in my judgment, is that when the entity which you represent legally is attacked or sued, you should defend it. Here, the court sought to make the state responsible and liable for the payment of these very substantial sums of money, and the state had not been found really guilty of anything.\nI also took the position, on behalf of the state, that the court's inter-district remedy in that case was inappropriate because there was never any finding of an inter-district violation.\nNow, to me, I just want to try and make it clear, it's been mentioned on several occasions, and I just think I want to have the opportunity to say with clarity that I do not support segregation; I support integration.\nI happened to have been a young person in school when Brown v. Board of Education was announced. The schools in my town had been segregated. They were immediately integrated. And I support that. And so I would be very pleased--there was a list of things that were similarly...\nLEAHY: And we'll go back to them, and I will make absolutely sure, I can assure you, that you will have the time to go on them.\nI would point out, though, that on the case you speak about, the federal district court threatened to hold the state in contempt if it didn't submit a specific desegregation plan within 60 days and said, quote, \"The court can draw only one conclusion: The state has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of this court.\"\nWhat I'm driving at...\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, I'd be glad to respond to that if you'd like to have me do so.\nLEAHY: I will. Hold on one moment.\nASHCROFT: I take these very seriously...\nLEAHY: Well, go ahead. Respond to that.\nASHCROFT: Well, you know, if the state hadn't been made a party to the litigation and the state is being asked to do things to remedy the situation, I think it's important to ask the opportunity for the state to have a, kind of, due process and the protection of the law that an individual would expect.\nA person swears to uphold the law of the state and to become the attorney general, when the state is attacked, I think it's important to expect the attorney general of the state to defend the state. Now over time it may be that if there had been a different structure, something different would have happened.\nLEAHY: Did you consider--and this you actually can answer yes or no--did you consider the district court was fair in suggesting that you, on behalf of the state of Missouri, that you were basically dragging your feet? Do you think that was fair?\nASHCROFT: I think it's unfair to characterize a person as being uncooperative if they are asked to indemnify a situation when there was no opportunity for them to originally be a party to the lawsuit and if they weren't in a position to defend themselves. That would be unfair.\nLEAHY: So you found the criticism of you by the court to be unfair?\nASHCROFT: Frankly, I thought the ruling by the court that the state would have to pay when there was not showing of a state violation to be unfair.\nLEAHY: Thank you, but now my question--do you feel that their criticism of you in your role as attorney general was unfair?\nASHCROFT: Would you mind--this is 20-some years ago...\nLEAHY: \"The court can draw only one conclusion: The state has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of this court.\"\nWould you consider that unfair?\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nLEAHY: Thank you.\nNow, Dr. Satcher--David Satcher--you opposed his nomination to be our surgeon general even though the Senate eventually approved him. In your speech, you said, \"Dr. Satcher says he has a mainstream approach; he's going to pursue consensus.\" But then you went on to say that you didn't believe that.\nYou told the Senate that he was, \"a person of incredibly strong medical credentials, in terms of his expertise and his capacity, but you said the United States has participated in confirming nominations or ratifying proposals without looking carefully at the ethics involved of the guys that are being challenged.\"\nSo the opposition to Dr. Satcher, by your own statement, was not based on his professional qualifications. Indeed, is it fair to say that applying an Ashcroft standard you were articulating as a U.S. senator that you are going to oppose a nominee who you believed to be out of step with the mainstream of America, to use the words you used in your speech.\nASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to express my concerns here. Dr. David Satcher supported a number of activities that I thought were inconsistent with the ethical obligations of a medical doctor and a physician, particularly the surgeon general, because I think the surgeon general is an individual to whom America must look for guidance in terms of not just technical expertise, but the kind of ethics that ought to accompany people who have life-and-death decision-making in their hands. We all know how important the medical profession is.\nLEAHY: And you disagreed with those ethics and values.\nASHCROFT: Yes, for example, he supported an AIDS study on pregnant women in Africa where some patients were given placebos, even though a treatment existed to limit transmission of AIDS from the mother to the child. In my understanding, this would not be an acceptable strategy for a study in the United States, but he was willing to support the study under those terms in Africa. That was a matter of deep concern to me.\nLet me--if I might--he lobbied Congress to continue an anonymous study testing newborn infants' blood for the AIDS virus, without informing the mother if the test was positive. Now, I have real problems with a situation where someone wants to be the surgeon general of the United States, wants to learn about whether or not there's AIDS present in a medical situation, and not tell the people involved about the AIDS virus.\nThis is a matter of deep concern to me. The idea of sending fatally infected babies home with their unwitting mothers, even after a treatment had been identified for AIDS, to me was an idea that was unacceptable for an individual who wanted to be the leader in terms of the medical community and a role model in the United States. It was on those grounds that I made the decision.\nNow, it's my decision and I'm not trying to duck responsibility for the decision. But those are the facts as I understood them, and that's the reason I made the decision.\nLEAHY: So it'd be fair to say you disagreed with his ethical choices and his values, and you felt you should vote against him because of that.\nASHCROFT: I think it's fair to say that I believed he violated the ethical values that are characteristic...\nLEAHY: I'm not trying to parse words, and I just want to make sure I understand, because I'm trying to get this...\n(CROSSTALK)\nASHCROFT: It was a shortfall in his adherence to ethical values of the American medical community that I think were...\nLEAHY: And because you disagreed with what you saw as his ethics and values, you voted against him. I'm not trying to place words in your mouth, I want to make sure I understand.\nASHCROFT: Well, then maybe...\nLEAHY: Trying to give you the fairest...\nASHCROFT: Well, maybe if you will let me state my words...\nLEAHY: Sure.\nASHCROFT: ... then you don't have to worry about placing words in my mouth.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI believed that his willingness to accept a standard for medical research in Africa, on African women, that would not be acceptable in the United States was an ethical lapse that was very important. I, secondly, believed his willingness to send AIDS-infected babies home with their mothers without telling their mothers about the infection of the children was another ethical problem that was very serious.\nBased on those standards, which I believe are less than acceptable standards in the medical community in this country, I voted against him.\nLEAHY: That's what I was trying to get you to say. Thank you.\nASHCROFT: I'm sorry.\nLEAHY: Maybe we were speaking past each other. But thank you.\nSenator Hatch?\nHATCH: Well, thank you.\nSenator Ashcroft, the principal argument raised against your nomination by some people is because of your firmly held personal beliefs, which happen not to be consistent with the views of the abortion right groups, the People for the American Way, and other similar interest groups; that you will not enforce the laws of the land as attorney general. That seems to be the argument.\nNow, your record, however, which the special interest groups seem to ignore, seems to provide clear evidence to the contrary. For example, as attorney general for the state of Missouri, you repeatedly issued legal opinions regarding how a particular statute should be interpreted and enforced.\nTime and again, Senator, your record reflects your dedication to enforcing the law, regardless of your particular views in areas like the environment, abortion, guns, religion and rights.\nLet me give just a couple of examples, and you gave some other examples in your opening remarks. You issued an opinion in 1981 that the Missouri Division of Health could not release information to the public on the number of abortions performed by particular hospitals. You determined that the state legislature made clear its intent that such reports remain confidential and be used only for statistical purposes. You also determined that in order to protect the patient-client privilege access to health data maintained by the Division of Health, that it only be subject to review by public health officers, something that people in the right-to-life community disagreed with you on. That's correct, isn't it?\nASHCROFT: It is correct.\nHATCH: You also, in Attorney General Opinion Number 50--I'm just going to mention two, there are all kinds of these.\nASHCROFT: Well, don't ask me to quote them. We had 800 or more.\nHATCH: I won't ask you to quote them. Let me see what I can do.\n\"In Attorney General Opinion Number 50, dated March 2, 1977, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an opinion, which interpreted state law to prohibit prosecuting attorneys from carrying concealed weapons, even while engaged in the discharge of their official duties. Attorney General Ashcroft reached this opinion, despite the fact that some prosecuting attorneys conducted their own investigations, and as a result faced dangerous situations.\" That's true too, isn't it?\nASHCROFT: Yes, sir, it is true. And it may not have been my personal judgment that their safety was best regarded by that, but the law was, we thought, clear.\nHATCH: That's what the law said, and so you enforced it. I mean, I have to admit I don't agree with that law either. They ought to be able to protect themselves. But I could go on and on with further examples, but I want to hear from you.\nThe special interest groups who have sharply attacked you, seem to ignore these instances where you have interpreted the laws as written, despite your personal beliefs.\nNow, if confirmed as attorney general of the United States, will you enforce the laws of this land irrespective of your personal beliefs?\nASHCROFT: I will. And I think I should clarify that just a little bit.\nMy primary personal belief is that the law is supreme; that I don't place myself above the law, and I shouldn't place myself above the law. So it would violate my beliefs to do it.\nSo I spent 24 years in elective public offices as--the auditor's office in Missouri is really a compliance office. We audit not only for financial integrity but for compliance with legal mandates to the agencies. I spent two years there as state auditor, and then the eight years as attorney general and eight years as governor.\nAnd there are other things you do as governor, but you also are a law enforcement individual. The executive branch does that. And most of my time in government has been in enforcement. And I'm pleased to say that I have enforced the law faithfully to the best of my ability in those settings.\nHATCH: With regard to Mr. Bill Lann Lee--I happen to like Mr. Lee, but I voted against him. Not because I wouldn't have supported him for any number of other positions; I would have, because he's a sincerely dedicated, decent, honorable man.\nBut when he appeared before the committee, I have to say that one of the problems that I had at that particular time was that I was concerned, because of his prior background, that he force consent decrees on local municipalities, cities, counties and other governments by bringing very expensive lawsuits that would cost millions of dollars to defend where they'd have to cave in to consent decrees that would require quotas that were really wrong under the Adarand and other decisions by the Supreme Court.\nI can remember--and like I say, while I have the highest personal regard for Mr. Lee's accomplishments when he was in the private sector, I was extremely concerned about his interpretation of civil rights laws.\nHis lifetime's work was devoted to preserving constitutionally suspect, race-conscious public policies that sort and divide citizens by race. For instance, Mr. Lee, when he appeared before the committee, interpreted the Adarand v. Pena case to mean that racial preferences are permitted if, quote, \"conducted in a limited and measured manner,\" unquote.\nNow, as I noted on the floor of the Senate, his statement mis-stated the court's fundamental holding on such programs that are presumptively unconstitutional. And unfortunately, I have to say, that his recent record indicates that's what he has been doing in a large degree, or at least to a significant degree, in his position in the Justice Department.\nSo there was a legitimate reason to vote against Bill Lann Lee, even though I think all of us would admit he's a nice person and probably could fill any number of other positions in government. I suspect that that's the reason you voted against him, and I can see why others might have voted for him, but the fact is, I had to do what I thought was the law. What about you?\nASHCROFT: Well, frankly, I struggled to say that perhaps earlier, not as effectively as you have just said it or as you said it on the floor. When he indicated that the test of whether a program would survive strict scrutiny was that it be limited and measured, he really basically was expanding the test substantially.\nThe district court on remand in that case said it, and I quote \"is difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored.\" But Mr. Lee, when asked if he could identify a single racial preference program that was unconstitutionally suspect, could only identify one out of all the programs.\nI think the key, though, is the material that you presented at the time, which I found persuasive, and his statement of a test for programs, which was just monumentally different than the test provided for by the court in the Adarand case.\nHATCH: It's been mentioned that you opposed certain aspects of federal court decrees surrounding the desegregation of schools in Kansas City. Well, Senator Ashcroft, isn't it time that in Missouri v. Jenkins, which is a poster-child case for what many think is judicial activism, that the Supreme Court found that the district court had exceeded its authority by ordering remedies beyond its power? Was your position not vindicated by the Supreme Court after some 18 years of litigation?\nASHCROFT: Well, very frankly, the Jenkins case was a five-four case...\nHATCH: Right.\nASHCROFT: ... and it was a case in which the judge imposing a tax was upheld in imposing the tax...\nHATCH: Yes, it wasn't the Congress the imposed the tax, it was the judge.\nASHCROFT: No, nor was it the state legislature or the city council.\nHATCH: That's right. So it was a legitimate argument.\nASHCROFT: Obviously, it's a legitimate argument. And I hope these hearings will allow me to clarify the fact that a state attorney general has a responsibility to defend the state when it is asked by other parties to open its treasury to fund one thing or another.\nThe situation in Kansas City, at the order of the federal district court judge, was tragic, in terms of the amount of money spent. And really, frankly, this hadn't become--this really wasn't that much of a partisan issue; it became clear that this was not helping children, but it was a very, very serious diversion of the state's resources, in a way which made difficult the achievement of other objectives.\nFor example, busing had strong opponents in Missouri, Democrat and Republican, black and white. Freeman Bosley, St. Louis' first African-American mayor, opposed forced busing, as did Democrat state Attorney General Jay Nixon. This forced busing that was opposed is not on their part or on my part an opposition to integration. It was an opposition to a counterproductive, inappropriate effort to impose on the state, transportation of students to and from, at great expense and at little benefit educationally to the students.\nHATCH: Well, I've heard some arguments against you, because of your firmly held religious beliefs. In fact, I've seen it over and over in the press in this country.\nWhen Vice President Gore selected our esteemed colleague, Joseph Lieberman, to be his running mate, many individuals and organizations supported that choice and applauded Senator Lieberman for his strong religious beliefs. I have to say, I felt the same way.\nUnfortunately, many left-wing groups have not been as supportive of your religious beliefs and convictions. Almost like it's OK for a liberal, but it's not OK for somebody who is conservative.\nPersonally, I, as a Christian, am very unsettled by the different treatment accorded you and Senator Lieberman. I think it's wrong.\nNow, the job of the attorney general of the United States is an extremely important job, and it is to enforce the laws enacted by Congress. The only issue for me is the manner in which you execute the job, or will execute the job.\nDoesn't matter to me whether you're Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, whatever, or an atheist or agnostic. I'm sure that goes for--I hope that I'm sure that that goes to the rest of our fellow senators. In fact, the Constitution of the United States specifically forbids religious qualifications for office.\nNow, having gone through that type of, I think, offensive criticism, which is continuing right up to today, is there anything in your religious beliefs that would impair you from faithfully and fully fulfilling your responsibilities as attorney general of the United States?\nASHCROFT: Well, I don't believe it's appropriate to have a test based on one's religion for a job. I think Article V of the Constitution makes that clear.\nIn examining my understanding and my commitment and my faith heritage, I'd have to say that my faith heritage compels me to enforce the law and abide by the law rather than to violate the law. And if in some measure somehow I were to encounter a situation where the two came into conflict so that I could not respond to this faith heritage which requires me to enforce the law, then I would have to resign. I do not believe that to be the case.\nCan I just say a word about this? America has struggled in this respect for quite some time, and people who come from different religious and faith perspectives have emerged at one time and another, and when they have, there have been questions about this. This is not new.\nBefore I was old enough to vote, but when I was old enough to be very active in watching elections, in 1960, the first person became president of the United States from a Catholic perspective. In my part of the country there were people who thought, \"He will not be free. He will have to do whatever the pope tells him to do. He will be a client of a foreign individual.\" You know, I heard that talk. But America got by that talk, and I think it's good that we did.\nAnd my own view is that, yes, people won't understand different kinds of individuals from time to time. Most people hailed, as I did, the elevation to national candidate status of my college classmate and former colleague here in the United States Senate, Joe Lieberman. We need more people like Joe Lieberman in public office, not fewer people like Joe Lieberman in public office.\nBut I was the first person from my faith denomination to be elected to a statewide public office, as attorney general. I was the first governor ever from my denomination.\nASHCROFT: I was the first senator from my denomination. I understand these things, and I think this is something we work our way through as Americans. And we're going to come to an understanding that well-intentioned people of good faith, when they raise their hand and take an oath to support the Constitution and enforce the law, they do it.\nAnd as I look back across America and this heritage--and it's been focused on different kinds of people at different times--I, frankly, don't see that our faith has been misplaced. As I look across--when we had our first Catholic president, we didn't suffer.\nSo, you know, I think this is something we will work our way through.\nHATCH: My time's just about up. Let me just ask you one last question.\nYou've publicly stated your agreement with the law of Adarand, which states that all racial classifications made by the government must be able to withstand strict scrutiny.\nYou were also a sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1997. This Civil Rights Act basically seeks to implement the Supreme Court's holding in Adarand with respect to federal racial classifications. The Civil Rights Act of 1997 does state that affirmative action, such as encouraging qualified women and minorities to apply for government contracts and employment, would not be affected.\nNow what sort of affirmative action programs would you support, if confirmed, and what would be your plans for the Civil Rights Division?\nAnd my time is up.\nASHCROFT: Well, very frankly, there are lots of ways that are acceptable, and some have been working their way through the courts and I think will be sustained.\nThe president-elect of the United States has identified a series of things that he calls affirmative access. I think those are good ideas. They've been in place now in Texas and in California and in Florida and are making their way in the educational system where access is so very important.\nWe can expand the invitation for people to participate aggressively so that no one is denied the capacity to participate simply because they didn't know about the opportunities. We can work on education, which is the best way for people to have access to achievement.\nThere are a wide variety of things. We can size government opportunities so that people can bid who don't have the megastrength of the big, old-time contractors but some new entrants into the marketplace.\nThese are all policy decisions that I believe this next administration--President-elect Bush is eager to consider. And, certainly, the affirmative access that he's described is something that I think the entire country would be well-served to work on.\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator Ashcroft.\nLEAHY: I just would not want to leave one of the questions from my friend from Utah to give the wrong impression to the people here and just, sort of, make it very clear. Have you heard any senator, Republican or Democrat, suggest that there should be a religious test on your confirmation?\nASHCROFT: No senator has said, \"I will test you,\" but a number of senators have said, \"Will your religion keep you from being able to perform your duties in office?\"\nLEAHY: I'm amazed at that.\nASHCROFT: Pardon?\nLEAHY: Well, I'm amazed at that--at any more than...\nASHCROFT: I understand, and I accept the opportunity to say with clarity that not only will I represent that I will enforce the law, but there is some record here of my two years as auditor, eight years as attorney, eight years in the governor's office, that when the law is clear and decided, that I enforce the law.\nLEAHY: Senator Kennedy?\nKENNEDY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nIf we could, Senator Ashcroft, come back to the St. Louis situation. Let me just spell out very briefly, as you remember, but just so that we have the common understanding.\nIn the '70s, more than 20 years after the Brown v. Board of Education, St. Louis still maintained a segregated school system. Finally, responding to the lawsuits brought by the parents, the courts stepped in and ruled the state of Missouri and the St. Louis School Board were jointly responsible for violating the Constitution by creating and maintaining segregated and grossly unequal schools.\nThe court ruled that the state had maintained an elaborate set of laws to enforce segregation. At one time, the state law even forced black children who lived in the suburbs and in white city neighborhoods to be bussed to all-black inner-city schools. According to the court, the state had completely abdicated its constitutional duty to desegregate the schools.\nYou disagreed with that finding, but despite your repeated appeals, requests for injunctions, three denials of review by the Supreme Court over a four-year period, the final ruling of the courts were not changed. So you had your chance in the courts to make the case that you've just made here and rejected on each time.\nLet me just continue.\n(CROSSTALK)\nKENNEDY: Now the city of St. Louis and its schools and surrounding 23 county districts all accepted the ruling. They negotiated a model desegregation plan, relying on the voluntary public school. Black students from city schools could volunteer, transfer to white suburban schools. White suburban students would have the opportunity to transfer to magnet schools run by the city.\nIn fact, the plan has been a lifeline for tens of thousands of students, with graduation rates that are consistently twice as high for the transferred students, more of them going on to college, and over 11,000 students are still using it today, including 900 suburban students.\nNow, given the voluntary nature of the desegregation plan and the fact that the city and country school districts all agreed to it, how do you justify your relentless opposition to the voluntary school desegregation and, sort of, a scorched earth legal strategy to try and block it?\nASHCROFT: Senator Kennedy, first of all, the litany of charges that were made about the state's activities included a rather loose definition of things that the state had done prior to Brown v. Board of Education. Virtually none of the offensive activities described in what you charged happened in the state after Brown v. Board of Education. As a matter of fact, most of them had been eliminated far before Brown v. Board of Education.\nSecondly, in saying that the city maintained a segregated school system into the '70s, is simply a way of saying that after Brown v. Board of Education when citizens started to flee the city and move to the county--and you'll know that St. Louis, for a number of decades now, has been a place that has lost more population than virtually any other city as people moved into the county--the schools, as people changed their location, began to be more intensely segregated. That was after the rules of segregation had been lifted, and it was not a consequence of any state activity.\nThen I would just simply say that I think it's unfair to call the program totally voluntary and to suggest that we opposed a voluntary program when the thing was that the state was going to have to pay for everything people volunteered to do.\nNow the situation was basically this: The county school districts agreed with the city school districts that they could confess judgment and get a lot of money from the state of Missouri by saying, \"If we'll just say that we'll do this voluntary plan, the state will have to pay for the situation.\"\nSo you had a situation something like this--and I don't have all the material that you all have, but let me try and recreate it from my memory.\nKENNEDY: I want to give you a fair chance, but we've got...\nASHCROFT: Well...\nKENNEDY: Go ahead.\nASHCROFT: Thank you for your fairness. Because when the machine gun of charges comes out, I want to try and respond to all the lead.\nKENNEDY: Well, let me give you one point that you've just raised, because I want to move on. In earlier, you said, \"Well, the state wasn't involved.\"\nASHCROFT: Well...\nKENNEDY: Well, now let me just read you. \"Now, 1980, in the Adams v. United States, the city board and the state were jointly responsible for maintaining segregated school system. 1982, we again note that the state and the city board.\"\nMy question is, how costly was this going to be, Senator Ashcroft, before you were going to say that those kids going in lousy schools, that you were going to do something about it? You were there as an attorney general, you were there as governor and did virtually nothing about it. And a new governor came in, Mel Carnahan, and resolved that and basically accepted it.\nYou used every kind of device to oppose it. You have the Economist magazine, which is not a liberal magazine, saying, \"The campaign\"--and you were involved in a campaign--\"quickly degenerated in 1984\"--when this was still before you--\"into a contest over who was most opposed to the plan for voluntary racial desegregation at St. Louis schools.\n\"Mr. McNary claimed that Mr. Ashcroft had not done enough to defeat the plan in court. Mr. Ashcroft countered that Mr. McNary was a closet supporter of racial integration. Both ran openly bigoted advertisement on television.\"\nThis is what we have in terms of Gary Orfield (ph), the consultant for the court in St. Louis, a leading expert on desegregation cases, testifies against desegregation. He said that you had no positive vision, constantly stirred up racial divisions over the questions.\nFinally, rather than provide the conciliatory leadership, in 1990 a judicial order described the recent state filings--recent state filings--as, \"Extremely antagonistic and said that state was ignoring the real objective of this case, a better education for the city's students, to personally embark on a litigious pursuit of righteousness.\"\nNow, that's a pretty tough record.\nThat's a pretty tough record.\nWhere in your priority would the rights of the interests of those black students that were trying to get a decent education? We've just heard you about what the cost was going to be, how you had a responsibility as an attorney general to protect the taxpayer. What about the interest of those black students? And the fact that you have those courts, repeatedly time, time, time again said that you failed to even offer an alternative. Did you offer an alternative?\nASHCROFT: Now may I respond?\nKENNEDY: Sure.\nASHCROFT: Thank you.\nIn all of the cases where the court made an order, I followed the order, both as attorney general and as governor. It was my judgment that when the law was settled and spoken that the law should be obeyed.\nAt one point, I had to detail the deputy attorney general of the state of Missouri to the state treasurer's office in order to urge the state treasurer to write the check. And the treasurer wrote the check. His name has been used in this hearing, but I won't use it. But it was because I explained to him that when the court spoke, the state had to respond and obey the law.\nNow, the framework for the system was that the state was to pay the city for the students who left, and the state was to pay again, in the county, for the students who had left and gone out there. It was not a way to integrate the city's schools.\nThe facts which you specific show that the brightest students left the city, leaving the students in those schools behind with fewer people aspiring to college graduation and going on further for education, not improving those schools.\nI'm pleased to respond to your question about my priority for education. During my time as governor, funding for education in the state of Missouri went up about 70 percent. The vast majority of all state resources that were new and available went to education, because I believe in education.\nIn Missouri v. Jenkins, the case in Kansas City...\nKENNEDY: Well, could we get on--I'm glad--I don't think we've...\n(CROSSTALK)\nHATCH: Let him answer the question.\nKENNEDY: All right, if he wants to take the--the question wasn't about Kansas City. I asked about St. Louis.\nHATCH: It was about education.\nASHCROFT: Fine.\nKENNEDY: And if he wants to talk about Kansas City...\nASHCROFT: I would like to talk about Kansas City, but it's not...\n(CROSSTALK)\nASHCROFT: I'd rather answer your question than talk about Kansas City.\nKENNEDY: That isn't the question, but if you want to talk about it.\nASHCROFT: Well, I'll just give you an idea...\nSESSIONS: You challenged his interest in education, Senator Kennedy, you suggested he didn't care about children.\n(CROSSTALK)\nLEAHY: All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.\nHATCH: Let him answer the question.\nLEAHY: First, I would note that whatever questions are asked, if the witness feels that he's not given time to answer all the questions he will be given time, as will senators be given time to do follow-up questions.\nKENNEDY: Well, I had one other area to cover, but whatever you want to do, John.\nASHCROFT: Well, you're the senator.\nKENNEDY: Well, you're the...\n(LAUGHTER)\nASHCROFT: Well, you know, I look forward to working with this committee upon confirmation, I do, and I don't know when there was last an attorney general that had previously served as a member of this committee. And, frankly, I think we can work together and I want to. I don't want any rancor to characterize our relationship, and I'm very pleased to defer.\nKENNEDY: Let me just go on one, hopefully, time, and this is on the questions of voter registration, vetoes, your vetoes on the voter registration. We talked about this.\nYou know, obviously we've learned in this presidential campaign every vote does count, and obviously the procedures in Florida and across the nation, plagued by inequities, often result in disenfranchisement of poor and minority. The Justice Department is conducting the investigation whether any of the voting irregularities that occurred in Florida violating the federal Voting Rights Act. So if confirmed, you'll have a responsibility for completing the investigation and bringing suit if any violations are found.\nNow, your actions as governor of Missouri--I'm concerned about your willingness about where you might go with this. Now, let me mention this.\nAs governor you appointed election boards in both St. Louis County and St. Louis city. The county which surrounds much of the city is relatively affluent, 86 percent white, votes heavily Republican. The city's poorer, 48 percent black, votes heavily Democratic.\nLike other communities across the state, the county election board has a standard procedure for training volunteers from nonpartisan groups, like the League of Women Voters, to assist the voter registration. And according to the press reports, the county trained as many as 1,500 volunteers, but the number of trained volunteers in the city was zero, because your appointed city board refused to follow the standard practice used in the county and throughout the rest of the state.\nAs a result, the county had a voter registration rate higher than the state average and considerably higher than the city. Now concerned about the obvious disparity, the legislature passed bills in 1988 and '89 to require the city to use the same training procedures as the county and the rest of the state. On both occasions, you vetoed these bills.\nIn 1988, you claimed it was unfair to impose this procedure just on the city of St. Louis, and in '89, the legislature responded by passing a bill applying the procedure to the entire state, but you vetoed it again. And you cited concerns about voter fraud, even though the Republican director of elections in the county was quoted as saying, \"It worked well here and I don't know why it wouldn't work in the city as well.\" That makes sense. The only difference between the county and city is that the city is poorer, more heavily African-American, and votes Democratic.\nThe question, rather than working to expand the right to vote, you and the appointed election board in the city did all you could to block the increased voter registration. The results of your stonewalling tactics are clear: By the time you left the governor's mansion, the city of St. Louis had the lowest voting registration in the state, 15 percent lower than St. Louis County. Eight years later, Governor Carnahan's reforms in the St. Louis city election, and now the rate for St. Louis city has increased dramatically.\nWhy did you feel that you had to not provide the same kind of registrars in the city as you did in the county and as they did in the rest of the part of the state, particularly when those groups indicated their willingness to provide those services?\nASHCROFT: Well, thank you for the question, Senator Kennedy. And let me just say, that I am concerned that all Americans have the opportunity to vote. I'm committed to the integrity of the ballot box. I know what it means to individuals who are deprived of the opportunity to vote, and I know what it means to candidates who have been the subject of elections where the integrity of the ballot box has been violated. I have personal experience in that respect.\nI vetoed a number of bills as governor, and, frankly, I don't say that I can remember all the details of all of them. Accordingly, I reviewed my veto message and recalled that I was urged to veto these bills by the responsible local election officials. I also appeared to anticipate the Supreme Court's recent decision, as I expressed a concern that voting procedures be unified statewide.\nI would like to read my relatively short veto statements from the two relevant bills. And these are statements which I made when I was governor.\nKENNEDY: OK.\nASHCROFT: And it's quite sometime...\nKENNEDY: And if you could elaborate on the local officials that urged you to veto them, the reason why they did that. If you could add that, I'd appreciate it. And my time then is up.\nASHCROFT: \"Conference Committee Substitute for House Bill Number 1333\"--I believe it is--\"is vetoed and not approved for the following reasons. The Comprehensive Election Act of 1977 was intended to simplify, clarify and harmonize the laws governing elections. Section 115.003 revised statutes of Missouri, 1988, the General Assembly has directed that the act be construed and applied so as to accomplish this purpose.\n\"The few amendments to this law since 1977 have been acted only as necessary to further statewide policy goals. Election bills approved by the general assembly this year continue this trend by standardizing voter registration and other election procedures.\n\"Conference Committee Substitute for House Bill 1333 stands in marked contrast to the overall trend of our election laws. It would single out one election authority and mandate for that one authority that certain procedures be followed. I see no compelling reason to impose this special requirement on the St. Louis Election Board.\n\"There are more than 150 permanent registration sites spread throughout the city of St. Louis. Each of these sites is manned by bipartisan, board-appointed registrars and is in a public facility. Before every election, the board opens an additional 84 special registration sites manned by bipartisan registration teams at places such as shopping centers, churches and union halls. The success of the St. Louis Election Board in promoting voter registration is evidenced by the fact that the city has a registration rate of 73 percent compared to the national average of 69 percent.\n\"I join with the proponents of this bill in encouraging the St. Louis Board of Election commissioners to review its present policy and to work to ensure that every resident has a clear opportunity to register to vote. But even as we work to increase voter registration, we must preserve the right of the voters to participate in fair elections.\n\"The bipartisan St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners, St. Louis Board of Aldermen President Tom Villa (ph), and St. Louis circuit attorney George Peach (ph), have expressed concerns about the impact of this bill on the democratic process and urged me to veto it.\"\nI might add that Tom Villa (ph) was a noted Democratic leader in the state of Missouri from the city of St. Louis. The Villa (ph) family had a historic, sort of, reputation. I don't know whether some of you close to St. Louis will remember that.\nSt. Louis circuit attorney George Peach (ph) was a Democrat who was the prosecutor in the St. Louis area, so we had a bipartisan county election board said, \"This is not good; this is not right.\"\nYou had the Democrat circuit attorney saying, \"I have reservations about this; this shouldn't be done.\" You have the St. Louis Board of Aldermen president--an almost totally Democrat organization, the Board of Aldermen, City of St. Louis, is about as Democrat as the Democratic National Committee.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThey all urged me to veto this bill.\nNow, I do think that when you look at the recent Supreme Court rulings pushing us more towards uniformity, that it's important to understand that creating and carving out special responsibilities in a variety of settings is something we shouldn't do.\n\"The people of St. Louis,\" I went on to say, \"have an absolute and fundamental right to open, fair, and non-partisan elections. My veto of this bill today will protect that right. For the above and foregoing reasons, Conference Committee Substitute for House Bill Number 1333 is returned and not approved.\"\nASHCROFT: The second veto message is--I'd be happy to read another one.\nKENNEDY: No--Mr. Chairman, it's not necessary.\nThe point, Senator, if I could just add and get your response and then I'll--you vetoed it because it was special legislation for St. Louis. Then, the next year the legislature said, \"OK, because you haven't done anything in St. Louis, we'll apply it statewide.\" That's what I can't understand.\nI can see you saying, \"It's special legislation, so we won't do it for St. Louis because it's special.\" Now you've just mentioned the Supreme Court wants uniformity. The state legislature said, \"OK, let's get uniformity.\" And you've vetoed that as well. That's the point, if you could address that.\nASHCROFT: Thank you very much. It just takes a lot longer to answer these charges than it does to make them, and I apologize for that.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: Well, all right. Gentlemen, just a moment. I want him to answer that, but I also point out, the witness said that sometimes the charges, or the questions, come I think machine gun fashion was his expression.\nI can assure you, the chair will make sure that you are given time to answer all of the questions. If, when you review the transcript, there's further answers you want, you'll be given the time to respond to that. And of course, the senator asking his question can follow up. But I don't want any implication being given that you would not have a chance to answer all the questions asked.\nASHCROFT: I appreciate that very much, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize if any of my remarks would indicate that you wouldn't fairly give me the opportunity to respond.\nThis is the veto message from the next year: \"House Committee substitute for House Bill Number 200 is vetoed and not approved for the following reasons: The bill would require election authorities to permit, quote, 'any recognized non-partisan civic organization, political, fraternal, religious or service organization interested in voter registration and education to conduct registration at any reasonable place selected by the organization.' The election authority is required to have a deputy registration official present at the place. The bill provides that these deputies may be volunteers.\n\"I encourage all qualified Missourians to register and vote in elections. I also encourage election authorities to improve voter registration efforts by keeping registration offices open for longer hours and by conducting registration drives at special registration sites.\n\"As I noted last year, in St. Louis alone, the success of the St. Louis election board is apparent from the fact that the city has a registration rate of 73 percent, compared to the national average of 69 percent. Efforts to promote voter registration must be balanced with the need to ensure that the voters participate in fair elections. This bill would tie the hands of election authorities and give private organizations a virtually unbridled right to add names to state voter registration rolls.\n\"As noted in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, there is no overwhelming reason to allow an individual group of any political persuasion to register people. With the numerous instances of voter fraud that the city has experienced in recent years, election officials should be cautious about their procedures. The registration apparatus must be available to everyone, but it also must be protected jealously to prevent its abuse.\n\"The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, quote, 'Keeping Registration Fair', close quote, 'Election authorities are free to participate...\"'--August 28. This was an editorial, not--I don't believe this editorial was about this specific measure. I don't want to create that impression.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEAHY: Well, all right. Gentlemen, just a moment.

Giving the overriding need to promote honesty and integrity in the process, I see no compelling reason to require that they do so in every instance in which a request is made.\n\"For the above and foregoing reasons, House Committee substitute for House Bill number 200 is returned and not approved. Respectfully submitted, signed John Ashcroft, governor.\"\nLEAHY: Senator Thurmond?\nTHURMOND: When outgoing Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before this committee for confirmation, I expressed concerns about her opposition to the death penalty, but I still supported her. Those views did not prevent her from being confirmed. Do you think most attorney generals have had to impose some law that they did not personally support?\nASHCROFT: Senator, I am virtually sure that everyone who has served in the attorney general's office has had to impose or enforce laws that he or she would not personally support.\nThe definition of personal support is almost inconsistent with laws, because laws are compromises of what people decide to do in the legislative process where we have a give-and-take in terms of what's finally achieved. So very seldom is there any law that's identical to the way any of us would write it completely.\nSo law enforcement officers uniformly, not just those in uniform, but those uniformly across the board, I think, always have to enforce laws that they wouldn't personally have written.\nTHURMOND: During much of the Clinton administration, the number of gun prosecutioners declined. For example, I single out prosecutions for using a gun to commit a felony dropped 46 percent from 1992 to 1998. As attorney general, will you expand successful gun prosecution initiatives, like Project Exile, and make imposing gun laws a priority?\nASHCROFT: I would hope that we would be able to more effectively enforce the laws relating to guns.\nFrom the data that I have seen out of Project Exile and other efforts around the country, we have a far greater and more dramatic impact on violent crime by enforcing gun laws than we do in many other efforts that we make to try and improve the personal security and safety of our citizens.\nAs a matter of fact, in the last couple of years, I've sought additional appropriations when a member of the Senate to fund a similar program in St. Louis--a program which I think is entitled Project Cease Fire. But it's similarly a focus on saying to those who use guns in the commission of a crime, \"You can't do that with impunity, and we will make sure that if you use a gun in the commission of a crime, you will regret it.\"\nIn Project Exile, the remediation and the rates of crime was very, very dramatic, and it seems to be a promising program that ought to be explored further. I think enforcement of gun laws holds great promise.\nAnd incidentally, I might add that, as attorney general of the United States, obviously I would be interested in advancing the agenda of the president when possible. And he has stated clearly his attention to have more vigorous and energetic prosecution of gun crime.\nTHURMOND: As a senator, you were very dedicated to the war on drugs. For example, you successfully led the fight to pass major drug legislation to combat the methamphetamine epidemic. As attorney general, would you continue that commitment to fight illegal drugs?\nASHCROFT: Well, Senator, I think the illegal drugs are a mark and a stain on America, but they are a mark against the young people of this country that makes very difficult their success in the future, and I would hope I would have an opportunity to have an energetic enforcement of the drug laws in this country in a way which would curtail drug use. And I would hope we would be able to lead in such a way as to make it possible for young people to look to national officials and to the, kind of, atmosphere we create as one that rejects drug use.\nIn the methamphetamine laws, which I had the privilege of working closely with members of this committee on, including Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein, we did a couple of things that were important. We took methamphetamine, which people had not taken seriously, and we put very serious penalties into the law.\nI think it was important that we put penalties in the law that were on a parity with the penalties for cocaine, because too often people thought that methamphetamine was not an important or challenging thing, and we needed to have an opportunity to make sure that we signalled our disapproval and the danger that these dangerous drugs really present to our young people.\nTHURMOND: A great deal of attention is focused on the rights of criminals, but we do not hear as much about the rights of victims. Nevertheless, you have been a leader for victims' rights. Should crime victims be a top concern for the Justice Department?\nASHCROFT: Indeed, they should. I had the privilege of being involved in signing victims' rights legislation in the state of Missouri, and I was eager to find a way to have a national program for victims' rights legislation, because too often technical problems relating to minor conflicts between the federal system and the state system made impossible an effective use of the state's victims' rights legislation to protect the interests of individuals who have been victims of crime.\nTHURMOND: You have been endorsed by numerous law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. Is it important for the attorney general to work closely with state and local law enforcement, including rural law enforcement?\nASHCROFT: Well, it certainly is important.\nOne of the things about methamphetamine that struck me in the state of Missouri is that it tended to be a rural drug. It wasn't as focused in our city centers, where drugs like cocaine were prevalent, but in the out-state portions of Missouri, the methamphetamine production in a variety of labs--and I'm sorry to say that Missouri is second only to California in terms of meth labs that were taken down.\nIt exploded on our state. There were two meth labs taken down in 1992; there were about 1,000 taken down last year in the state. And many more--I talked to one county sheriff who was in what we call a collar county around St. Louis where he said that his sheriff's department would take down 200 meth labs in that one county during the year.\nAnd at the same time I met with that sheriff, there were five or six small city police chiefs from that same county, and they said they would break down another 100. So there you have one county with 300 meth labs in a single year. It's a very serious problem. And it is in rural America. And our ability to provide assistance through HIDTAs and other programs in the Justice Department can help curtail this very serious threat.\nLEAHY: I'll put in the record a number of statements of others so that we can have a chance--one, so that the witness can have a chance, if he wishes to add to his answers, to do so in the transcript; but so those who asked a question would have also a chance to see that.\nWe will recess now. We will reconvene in the Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Building, third floor of the Russell Building, tomorrow morning at 10:00.\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, we have leave to file a written statement? May I have leave to file a written statement?\nLEAHY: Oh, of course. Of course.

{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84890", "text": "PRESIDENT-ELECT BUSH: Thank you all for coming. Good afternoon. Today I'm pleased to introduce two distinguished Americans who will be the newest nominees for my Cabinet.\nThe United States trade representative, I've selected Robert Zoellick. I've known Bob for many years. He's an experienced public servant, a veteran diplomat, a good negotiator, and a man of great skill and energy. Mr. Zoellick will serve as our country's top trade negotiator and will be a key adviser to the president on trade policy.\nAs I've often stated, a successful economic strategy must include a confident, assertive trade policy. We will open new markets for products grown and made in America. That will be one of our foremost goals. We will ensure that trade agreements are enforced and that American farmers and workers and entrepreneurs are treated fairly.\nBob and I recognize that we now are in a global economy and that trade will not only mean a good economy at home, trade will mean a good economy with our trading partners.\nBob and I also understand the importance of having a good, active trade policy in our own hemisphere. As I've said, our neighbors to the south of us and to the north won't be afterthoughts of foreign policy or economic policy, they'll be an integral part of making sure that our hemisphere and our world is strong and peaceful.\nAs USTR, Mr. Zoellick, soon to be ambassador Zoellick, will be a full partner in trade team and a full member of my Cabinet.\nIt's a pleasure to welcome this talented man back into public service and to my administration.\nI also welcome Elaine Chao, who will be the nominee for secretary of labor.\nIn the campaign I laid out priorities for working Americans. I talked about a strong educated and productive work force in which all can participate. This means job training for those left behind in our new economy. It means that people leaving welfare will need job skills necessary to seize the opportunities of the moment. It means that a disability should not bar anyone from the work place.\nThese will be the priorities of the Department of Labor and of the new secretary.\nShe brings to this post the qualities for which she is known and admired--strong executive talent, great compassion, and a commitment to helping people build better lives.\nElaine Chao believes deeply in the American dream because she has lived it. She came to America at the age of eight not knowing a word of English. Her successful life gives eloquent testimony to the virtues of hard work and perseverance and to the unending promise of this great country. I welcome Elaine to our cabinet as well.\nI'm going to ask Bob and Elaine to say a few words, and I'll answer a few questions before I depart to the great state of Texas, then to return to become sworn in as your president.\nROBERT ZOELLICK: Well, first I'd like to thank very much the president-elect. I'm delighted that I will have the opportunity to work with him. And I'm honored by the confidence that he has vested in me.\nAnd I'm very proud to be a member of the team that he has assembled.\nAs the president-elect said during the campaign, free trade is about freedom. It's important for our economy but also for America's other interests and values throughout the world.\nI've always believed that openness is America's trump card. It makes us stronger as a people, and it makes us more dynamic as a nation.\nI also recognize that change isn't easy, and it can be frightening. I and others will be listening to consumers, to workers, to business people, to farmers, and others to try to help them benefit and adjust to the openness in competition, try to open doors of opportunity for all of them, as well.\nI know very well that Congress has the authority over international trade, and no trade policy can be successful without effective executive and congressional relationship.\nSo, if confirmed, I look forward to working very closely with Congress, both sides of the aisle, from day one.\nI'm very appreciative of the help and the counsel I've gotten from individual senators and members over the course of years in different circumstances, and I'm going to need their help again.\nFinally, I've been very fortunate to have been encouraged and taught and supported by so many people--teachers and friends and colleagues and people with whom I've worked. But I just want to single out one for a special thanks: my wife, Sherry, who has given me more than I can ever possibly return.\nThanks.\nELAINE CHAO: Good afternoon.\nI'm very honored to have the opportunity to work with the President-elect Bush to ensure that we protect, nurture, and develop our nation's most precious resource, and that's America's working men and women.\nAnd I look forward to ensuring that America's workforce continues to compete successfully in the global economy in this new century.\nYou know, when my mother, sisters and I arrived on the shores of America when I was 8 years old, the boat on which we came, a freighter, passed the Statue of Liberty. And as a I looked up at the Statue of Liberty I thought at that time what a wonderful country, that I've arrived. And yet never could I have dreamed at that time that I'd be standing before you today as President-elect Bush's choice for secretary of labor.\nI want to thank you, Mr. President-elect, for your trust and confidence.\nI also want to thank my husband, Mitch, for his love, and he is the love of my life. He's currently in Kentucky today, tending to the needs of our state.\nI also want to thank my parents and sisters. You know, my parents were such a young couple when they first came to America. They had so little. But they were fortified with life's most precious treasures, and that is faith in the Lord, faith in the basic decency and goodness of this country, and also love of family.\nLet me assure you that I will bring to this job the same passion for America that my father demonstrated many years ago when he came to America. Our early years in this country were difficult. My father held three jobs to make ends meet. My mother worried constantly over our meager budget. And of course we missed our family and friends who were a world away.\nI entered the third grade not speaking a word of English, but every day I would copy whatever was on the blackboard into my notebook, and I'd take it home. And nightly, after a long day's work, my father, with great love and even greater patience, translated that day's lesson, struggling to make sense of my childish scrawls. And that's how I learned English.\nBut my father taught me--my parents taught me so much more than just how to speak the language of this country. My parents taught me the founding principles of this country, the principles of freedom and opportunity, the value of hard work, the need to ensure that every man and woman is compensated fairly for their hard work.\nAnd once confirmed, if confirmed--I sure hope so--I will apply these lessons and principles to every aspect of the Department of Labor, as I myself labor to carry out President-elect Bush's vision for the working men and women of this country, a vision of American, he mentioned, with a strong and productive work force in which everyone can participate, where jobs and opportunities are available for those leaving welfare, where job training is available for those left behind in our new economy.\nAnd we must ensure that a disability never bars a qualified person from the workplace, and that parents have an easier time balancing the responsibilities of home and work.\nLet me also say that I look forward to working with the labor and business leaders of this country. As president and CEO of United Way of America in the mid-1990s, I was privileged to work with key leaders of organized labor, such as John Sweeney and Mort Barr (ph) to provide charitable services and solutions to those in our country who need help the most. I look forward continuing and building upon those relationships.\nI want to thank you, once again, President-elect Bush and also Vice President-elect Cheney for the opportunity to serve the hardworking men and women of this country.\nThank you.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, you've now had one nominee withdraw. Another one, your nominee for attorney general, is up against formidable opposition. Did you anticipate you'd have so much trouble this early on with some of your nominees?\nBUSH: Yes.\nQUESTION: And what do you plan to do moving forward? Do you stand behind Senator Ashcroft? And will you be making any phone calls to senators...\n(CROSSTALK)\nBUSH: If need to, I will. And of course I'll stand behind John Ashcroft. He's going to make a very good and very strong attorney general.\nI never expected our nominees to sail through without harsh questioning and good confirmation hearings, and I look forward to them. I can't wait for John to have a fair hearing so people get to see what he's made out of. And he's going to do a good job. I'm confident he'll be confirmed.\nQUESTION: Sir, can you explain the reasoning behind your decision to make Mr. Zoellick, if he's confirmed, a full member of your Cabinet?\nBUSH: Yes.\nQUESTION: And secondly, can you clarify what relationship he'll have to your eventual secretary of commerce? Will he be in any way subordinate to the secretary of commerce or will he report directly to you?\nBUSH: A good question. He'll report directly to me. He'll be a member of the Cabinet. And the reason why he needs--the position needs to remain a Cabinet-level position is because of the importance of trade in the global economy. It should reconfirm our nation's commitment to free trade.\nAnd I'll be in touch with Bob a lot to find out how negotiations go.\nI'm going to remind him, for example--and he doesn't need to be reminded of this, but we'll have single undertaking negotiations when it comes to trade agreements so that our agricultural sector is not traded out in the end. I mean, it's important for us to be opening up markets around the world so our farmers can be selling in to open markets, for example.\nAnd I want to follow closely those aspects of trade agreement that deal with areas such as agriculture. It's something I talked about a lot in the campaign, and it's something I want to pay attention to. And in order to do that, I want to have him report directly to me.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Your secretary of the interior-designate, Gale Norton, made a speech a few years ago in which she lamented the loss in the Civil War, the confederacy, because she said too much was lost--referring to states' rights doctrine.\nWhat do you say to citizens who might hear that and are concerned that your nominee's defending the states' rights position of the confederacy may mean a retreat from federal protection through federal power of minority rights?\nBUSH: I'd say that's just a ridiculous interpretation of what's in her heart. She's been the attorney general of the state of Colorado. She's a person who upheld the laws of that state. She is--she in no way, shape or form was talking about any value to slavery.\nAnd, you know, what happens in this town is, the voices of the special interests like to tear people down. That's just part of the process. I understand that. But this is a good, strong woman who's going to do a very good job as the interior secretary.\nYou know, I was amazed, the other day, somebody was getting on her because she wanted to drill in ANWR. Well, guess who else thinks we ought to, in order to make sure we got enough energy for the nation? The president-elect. It shouldn't surprise people that I picked people that share a philosophy with me.\nAnd we're going to have a balanced policy when it comes to federal lands, and she's the right person to lead the interior department.\nI'm confident when she gets a fair hearing, when people hear her and listen to what she has to say and look at her record as an elected official in a state like Colorado, she's going to be confirmed.\nQUESTION: Sir, as you know, Senator Boxer of California has been the first Democratic senator who's come out in opposition to Senator Ashcroft publicly. She commented late yesterday that the selection of Senator Ashcroft is, quote, \"at odds\" with your claim to be a uniter, and that the hearings in the Senate are going to be very hard on the nation. And I'd like to get your comments on those comments.\nBUSH: Well, it doesn't have to be hard, if the senators will tone down their rhetoric.\nAnd secondly, I picked John Ashcroft because he's a good attorney. He's going to be the attorney general, he's going to be the nation's lawyer, and he'll enforce the laws on the books. And people will get a chance to hear that.\nThis, too, was a person who was elected to public office. He was the attorney general of the state of Missouri, he was the governor in the state of Missouri, because a United States senator in the state of Missouri. Missouri, as you all know, those of you who follow politics, is what they call a swing state. It's a state that looks very carefully at candidates, regardless of party. And this is a competent man who will do the job.\nI don't expect him to get 100 percent of the vote in the Senate. I wish he would, but I don't expect that.\nBut it's up to the members of the Senate to determine how civil the discussions will be.\nI expect they will be. I know the questioning is going to be tough, but John is prepared for tough questioning.\nAnd I look forward to the hearing, and I want America to see this good man answer the questions that many will have for him.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, you say you expected Ashcroft to get something of a rough ride. What specifically do you think is unfair about the mounting opposition against him? And are you concerned as to the work of both parties that his confirmation hearing is shaping up to be something of a spectacle?\nBUSH: Well, I expected at least one member of my Cabinet to get a pretty tough hearing. You know, it could've been John, it could've been somebody else. I've never known the Senate just to say, gosh, this is a wonderful selection, we'll just let them all sail through.\nI do think there's going to be some interesting discussions about the law and his willingness to enforce civil rights laws, for example, and he will. I had a good long talk with John about civil rights laws. This is a good man. He's got a good heart.\nAnd when people hear his record and see what he's done in public life and having been elected twice--or three different times, three different offices statewide in Missouri--they'll find him to be an accomplished, good American. And I'm confident he'll win the votes.\nI'm not suggesting the hearings are going to be, you know, nice, smooth sailing for him. It's going to be a lot of tough questioning, but the tone of the questions is going to be up to the questioners. I'm confident the answerer of the questions will do so in a dignified way.\nYes, sir?\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, conservative groups have taken sort of an initiative in coming out strongly in favor of the Ashcroft nomination, much more so than they did with the Chavez nomination. I'm wondering if you've taken note of the difference there.\nBUSH: No.\nQUESTION: And what is your reaction to it?\nBUSH: I haven't. I've been busy on preparing for my arrival here next week, and I haven't been really paying attention to all the different lobbying efforts and the voices that are, you know, the people that are kind of surrounding, you know, John with support and/or against him.\nTo the extent that people want to help his nomination, that's fine. But I think he can stand on his own. I think he's plenty confident of answering the questions in the Senate about the different matters that senators are going to ask him. And I'm confident he's going to be confirmed. If somebody asks the question am I standing behind him, absolutely. I mean, he's going to do a really good job.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, what did you think of President Clinton's remarks questioning--seemingly to question the legitimacy of your presidency?\nBUSH: Well, you know, I always--you know, I won the recount I think three or four times, and I was always worried about the revote. But when they counted the ballots in the state of Florida, I won. And he can say what he wants to say, but January the 20th I'll be honored to be sworn in as the president.\nSTAFF: Thank you very much.\nBUSH: Thank you all.\nListen, for those of you in the press pool, hustle.\n(LAUGHTER)", "timestamp": "2001-01-11", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference Announcing the Nomination of Elaine Chao as Secretary of Labor and Robert Zoellick as U.S. Trade Representative"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84908", "text": "ARI FLEISCHER: Good afternoon, everybody. Apologies for the scheduling change and juggling today. I hope you understand. We'll have to keep today's briefing limited to 2:30 I'm afraid, because of the president-elect's remarks.\nAnd with that, no opening statement, I'll be pleased to take any questions.\nNo questions?\nQUESTION: Do you think that comments by President Clinton in recent days serve to delegitimize a Bush presidency?\nFLEISCHER: No, I cannot say that. The president has been elected by the American people, his election has been accepted by one and all.\nNo. I just think, again, there is a longstanding tradition that presidents depart office with a note of grace, with a note of respect, and I can't imagine that President Clinton would want to leave office in any other manner.\nYes, sir?\nQUESTION: Did he get his big CIA briefing?\nFLEISCHER: He did.\nQUESTION: Did he talk to Tenet?\nFLEISCHER: I don't know who the attendees were. I don't know.\nQUESTION: If he didn't talk to Tenet, do you know if he intends to talk to him about the position there?\nFLEISCHER: The back door to personnel.\nLet me take the question on whether Tenet was there for the briefing, but I'm not going to go the personnel road.\nQUESTION: What did you think about the attacks on--or the bringing up of this speech by Gale Norton? Does this show that she's got racist views in any way, or extreme views?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think that's more of what is so unfortunate about the way politics has become in Washington, when a good person's record can be so wildly distorted by special interest groups whose agenda is not accuracy, but distortion. And that's unfortunate. That's part of the process that needs to change.\nQUESTION: Ari, does it look like it will be harder for the president-elect to meet his pledge of becoming a uniter in Washington? What can he do to...\nFLEISCHER: No, I think just the contrary. Take this morning's education meeting. That was a diverse group of people coming from many different backgrounds. They talked to the president-elect about one agenda item that probably has more--that the American people care about more than any other agenda item, and that is improving education in this country.\nAnd when you look at the comments that were made, I think you heard the president-elect himself say that what he's interested in are things that work and results regardless of whether it's Democratic or Republican, and that's the type of spirit he's going to bring. So we're very encouraged by that.\nListen, we understand there are always going to be people who fall outside the partisan mainstream. That is their right and they can do that. President-elect Bush is going to seek to be president for all the people, and he's going to have an agenda involving education, getting prescription drugs to seniors, providing tax relief, rebuilding the military, that's aimed at that type of unity government.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Does the president-elect intend to stay at the ranch through the weekend until Monday?\nFLEISCHER: I don't have the exact details on his schedule, but given the fact that he no longer has his home in Austin, I think that's likely, but I want to be precise, so...\nQUESTION: Anything new about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday of next week?\nFLEISCHER: I intend to have a read tomorrow on his schedule for next week. And then I'm going to try to get next week into some more events vis-a-vis the inauguration and the themes that the president-elect is going to speak to. So that will probably happen on next week's schedule that I'm going to try to do tomorrow.\nQUESTION: Is Wednesday the day that the president is coming?\nFLEISCHER: That's what I want to kind of get into tomorrow. I'm going to try to walk you through the whole schedule about what he's going to do and run up to the inaugural.\nQUESTION: But do you have it firmed up at this point? Or is it still opened to some...\nFLEISCHER: Well, the reason I always like to wait, I want to make sure it's precise and so there could be some moving parts and I don't have them all in front of me anyway. As soon as it's available, I'll give it out tomorrow.\nQUESTION: Do you think he's planning to meet more and more different types of groups for unity in the coming days or weeks?\nFLEISCHER: Well, he continues to do that. That's part of governing, part of what president's do. So he will continue.\nQUESTION: I've got a housekeeping question. For those of us who didn't bother to apply for inaugural credentials--it's going to be such chaos next week--are we going to be even able to get into this section of town with the Bush credentials? Or so, could you look into it?\nFLEISCHER: I thought you were looking to me for credentials.\nQUESTION: No. No. No. I mean, hopefully we don't have to come in. But if we do?\nFLEISCHER: That's all being handled by the inaugural committee. And so I really don't know how that's going to work. I would refer you to inaugural.\nQUESTION: Security is going to be so tight that maybe even those with the White House credentials might not...\nFLEISCHER: I'll be happy to vouch that none of you in this room are security risks, so far.\nQUESTION: About the Norton speech, is there any feeling by the president-elect or by people in the Bush-Cheney transition that there was anything wrong with what she said?\nFLEISCHER: The president-elect saw the story this morning. He thought that this was--just as I indicated--the usual Washington distortions.\nHe appointed Secretary Norton-designate for a good reason, because of her strong record on the environment, on public lands issues in the West, on land issues in the West. And he believes she'll make an outstanding secretary of the interior.\nYou know, she has a 20-year record in the state of Colorado on environmental issues, on federal land issues. She has a track record of bringing people together from a variety of sides of contentious issues. I don't need to remind anybody how difficult land issues are--water issues are out West.\nAnd she is known in Colorado--I would refer you to today's Denver Post editorial--for bringing people together and for doing a good and able job.\nQUESTION: My question really is: Was there anything wrong with that--with what was said in that specific speech?\nFLEISCHER: I think the point that she was making is that slavery is so wrong, so wrong that whatever argument or doctrine that is used to defend it is going to become tainted. That is the point she as making in that speech. And I think that no one has made any accusations beyond that.\nQUESTION: Ari, you talked about the diverse group this morning, but I noticed that there were no members of the teachers' unions who backed Al Gore. Are they going to be shut out from education talks?\nFLEISCHER: No one will be shut out. But I think we're allowed the right to have meetings that constantly involve different groups of people, and that's what we intend to do. But there was a healthy smattering of people from a variety of backgrounds there.\nAnd, certainly, I think one of the big changes--and I talked about this a couple weeks ago--that people in education are looking for--what the person sitting at the president-elect's right, I think, Ed Rust--is the chairman of the Business Roundtable's Education Committee.\nI mean, to get the business community involved in education is a powerful step forward in America. No less a person than Charlie Rangel on the House Ways and Means Committee is an advocate of doing that.\nPhyllis Hunter, sitting on his left, a former schoolteacher, now has a big reading initiative program in the state of Texas.\nThat's where we're going to keep bringing people together, and we're going to keep having different forums. Nobody will be shut out.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) of the president there this morning.\nFLEISCHER: I think that's a testament to how powerful his ideas are.\n(LAUGHTER)\nYes?\nQUESTION: On the education bill that he'll introduce, do you see it being a comprehensive package of reforms that includes a voucher initiative?\nFLEISCHER: It'll be what he ran on, and what he ran on was a school choice initiative--some people call it vouchers. It really is technically a school-choice initiative because it only applies to those Title I schools that after three years who fail to live up to standards, and therefore the children do not get good educations at those schools.\nOnly after three years do the children in those schools and the families in those schools have the right to financial support in the form of school choice that they could use to go to another school of their volition. So that, technically, is a different definition.\nBut, no, it's going to be what he ran on.\nQUESTION: The whole thing together as one...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: A comprehensive package.\nQUESTION: Is he working with any of the committee leaders to put this into legislative form? When I say he, I mean, you know, the transition team.\nFLEISCHER: Yes, the policy coordination group. You know, I haven't asked them to tell me everybody you're talking to in putting it together. I can only imagine that is they are (inaudible) of process.\nBut let me say that he will propose and then work very closely with the Congress, but he is going to want to have a proposal that resembles that which he campaigned on. I haven't asked Margaret to give me the list of everybody she's talking to, though.\nQUESTION: Well, when President Clinton came in, they didn't consult with the committees on the health care initiative, and it came crashing down. I wonder if he sees the perils of not working closely with the committees that actually pass the legislation.\nFLEISCHER: Well, in fairness to President Clinton, and at that time, I think their 1993 initiative was of a wholly different order. And I really can't say you can compare the two.\nIt's always an interactive process for the executive, no matter what party to work with the legislature in developing policy, you consult, you listen to, you put your policies together.\nWe have a congressional affairs team that's up on the Hill. We hear from Leader Lott, from Speaker Gingrich--Speaker Hastert--I'm dating myself...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... and listen to the advice that they have and then send our packages up to the Hill.\nQUESTION: Trent Lott has joined the growing chorus of Republican voices that are calling for quick action on a retroactive across-the-board tax cut. When are you going to make a decision if, in fact, you're going to ask the Republican Congress to adjust his tax bill?\nFLEISCHER: The timetable is not determined yet and he has not even assumed the powers of the office yet. But the time table is just not yet determined.\nQUESTION: On John Ashcroft, who are you hoping to get out there as witnesses to counter the witnesses of the Democrat...\nFLEISCHER: Let me refer that specific question to Mindy Tucker, who is handling the Ashcroft nomination from a press point of view.\nQUESTION: Any concerns about people like Specter? Or are you confident, and why would you be confident that he will pass it?\nFLEISCHER: I'm personally not going to get into the specific head counting, vote counting business in out of respect to the Senate. They need to have their hearings. We think it's appropriate for people to have their hearings and then make up their mind.\nSo we'll wait, but we remain fully confident that the United States Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, is going to vote in favor of Secretary-designate Ashcroft's position--confirmation.\nQUESTION: Even though he's so pro-life--even though he's so anti-abortion and he would have to be supporting abortion laws?\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, you have people who are even so one position or other on the liberal side who have always been appointed, and I think it would be a sad day for the country if the traditions in the Senate changed this year and the bar of bipartisanship was brought even lower that now presidents don't get the latitude in appointing the people who support their governing agenda to the Cabinet.\nQUESTION: Is the president-elect concerned that, through the work of both parties, the Ashcroft confirmation hearing is shaping up to be a real spectacle?\nFLEISCHER: I think it's not something that he can control. People have questions they want to ask, and we expect the Senate will be very respectful and that is the hearing process.\nQUESTION: But did he not anticipate this kind of thing when he named Ashcroft? Or is he concerned that it in some way threatens the spirit of cooperation that he hopes reigns?\nFLEISCHER: I think it's always hard to anticipate how partisan Washington will get. I think it all depends; sometimes it is, sometimes it's not.\nWhat we hope is that people don't go too far in their partisanship, that people are afforded a fair hearing and a balanced hearing, and all indications we have so far is he will have a fair hearing and a balanced hearing. So in that sense the Senate is following its honored prerogatives.\nI just find what I think is more troubling is a lot of the liberal special interest groups that are trying to put pressure on senators to vote a certain way. You had senators who took one stand, and then as the pressure mounts, they might have shift their stands.\nWe hope that everybody will have a fair hearing and a just hearing, and the indications we have from the Senate are that they will.\nQUESTION: Is there no pressure being exerted on Republicans?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think that most Republicans, virtually everybody I've heard of, I heard Leader Lott say yesterday that he thinks all senators are with Senator Ashcroft. They've known him for so long. They've served with him. They know him. They think he's a man of integrity, of character, of trust. So I think for those senators it's a natural.\nYes, sir?\nQUESTION: Let me ask it another way then. Is the president-elect surprised that the Ashcroft nomination has created such a stir, or whatever label you want to put on it?\nFLEISCHER: I'd be hard pressed to say that he's surprised. I think he understands how Washington can get sometimes. It's one of the reasons he wants to change the tone in Washington.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't you say that it's good for you?\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Wouldn't you say that it's good for you, energizing your conservative base? And it allows some people to deplore the partisanship.\nFLEISCHER: No. I think one of the things that President-elect Bush is going to do when he comes here and is sworn in is, not look at things with the usual prism that Washington looks at things--is it good for me, is it good for the other guys, will this help gin up the base, will this help somebody raise money.\nHe said that one of the lessons of this election, the close election that we've had, is that people need to put the national interest ahead of the partisan interest. And he's going to endeavor to contribute to that in the things he does and says, and we hope that others will follow.\nAnd I think we also--also, it's going to take time. He can't just come here overnight and change Washington. That is never going to happen. But he will endeavor to do so over the course of time.\nQUESTION: You'll make sure, won't you, that there are others on the staff who do that for him.\nFLEISCHER: Any names you'd like to mention?\nQUESTION: Ari, thinking about what you said there about it being in the national interest, how, then, is putting forward the name of a nominee who causes such deep divisions between people of different political ideology in the nation's interest?\nHow, then, is putting forward the name of a nominee, who causes such deep divisions between people in different political ideology in the nation's interest?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I just have to point out he has served in the Senate so ably all these many years, and you never heard these notes. These notes all seem to be sounded after liberal special interest groups chinned-up to start a fight.\nAnd I refer you to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a very well-respected Democrat, former senator, who has talked about what an outstanding attorney general he would be.\nQUESTION: There are also people that perceive being one of 100 as one thing, being one of one as quite another.\nFLEISCHER: But, again, I don't think you have seen these reflections. If Senator Ashcroft was indeed the things that his opponents have said about him, you'd think we may have heard it by now.\nAnd all of a sudden these are new creations that come in the heat of a confirmation battle as people seek, for ideological grounds, to derail a president's latitude in putting his people in place in his Cabinet to carry out the president-elect's agenda.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) he lost to Carnahan, who was actually dead. I mean, these issues are not new.\nFLEISCHER: But people run for reelection, and that's the course of campaigns. But I think people who serve with him in the Senate did not engage in those allegations that were made in the heat of a political campaign by groups within a state.\nQUESTION: Ari, many groups are opposing and planning to demonstrate against his nomination. If confirmed, how do you think he will deal with his opponents?\nFLEISCHER: In the same graceful, able manner he always has. And he will continue, as the president-elect does, to bring people together. And we hope that those oppose him will, after he's confirmed, join with us in helping bring the people together.\nQUESTION: Would you encourage Senator Ashcroft to release the text of his commencement address to Bob Jones University just to clear the air on that point?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not in the business of advising him. He's got a panel of people working with him on that. And so that's all I can do.\nQUESTION: Can you tell us about any themes that he'll address in his inaugural speech that might be significant to this whole discussion? I mean, President George Bush talked about kinder and gentler.\nFLEISCHER: What I'd like to do on that is I'm still getting my arms around that, and then I'm going to have more to say about it next week. And that's, again, why I want to indicate that I plan to and ensure with you all the information about where he is going, themes, et cetera, the departure from Texas, the arrival to Washington.\nHe'll be here for several days, of course, prior to the 20th. There will be events on those days. And so I want to let everybody know black tie and boots, of course, for those of us Texans in the room.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: A central theme in the Bush campaign was restoring honor and dignity to the White House, and appointing an attorney general who would enforce the law regardless of politics. Will Bush ask Louis Freeh to investigate whether Linda Chavez misled or lied to the FBI? And if she did, will his attorney general prosecute her?\nFLEISCHER: I think it's always at the discretion of the FBI to make any assessments about any misconduct if it was committed, and I'm not aware that any investigations are warranted. I have no reason to think there are.\nQUESTION: Ari, there's some potentially precedent-setting trade agreements being negotiated, apparently very aggressively by the Clinton administration with Singapore and Chile. I'm wondering if the president-elect would feel bound by what the Clinton administration might negotiate with regard to those treaties.\nFLEISCHER: That will fall into the category of not speculating about--not discussing foreign policy while we have the president-elect in office. Let's see what happens with these trade agreements. There still is nine days to go.\nI think I have time for about one or two more. I hate to do that today, but it's unusual day.\nQUESTION: Has the vice president-elect concluded his financial separation from the Halliburton company?\nFLEISCHER: I don't have that information.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Given the energy-crisis situation in California, and the president-elect's experience with deregulating the Texas markets, do you anticipate that the president-elect will continue the push for opening electricity markets to competition?\nFLEISCHER: Indeed he would. That is part of his national energy policy. He has shown that deregulation can and does work. That's what happened in Texas. That is the experience in Texas.\nAnd I do have to go. I think this is a good sign that the president-elect may be in the building.\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2001-01-11", "title": "Afternoon Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer, Spokesman for the President-Elect"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84903", "text": "LINDA CHAVEZ: Hi. I'm Linda Chavez. I guess you all know that. I guess everybody in America knows I'm Linda Chavez. Can't go anywhere these days.\nMy, what a difference a week makes. I saw all of you about a week ago, and as I'm sure many of you will recall, I began this adventure by invoking my parents and by talking about where I came from and how I grew up.\nI didn't have an easy life growing up. I faced a lot of adversity, particularly in my young childhood. I had--often one or another of my parents was in the hospital. My father got into a number of car accidents and spent a great deal of time in the hospital; so did my mother. And in every one of those incidents there was always someone there to help me. Family members took me in. Friends helped. There was financial and other kinds of support for me when I was growing up and I needed it.\nAnd I vowed to myself that, no matter what happened to me in my life, that I would be there for other people. And I've tried to do that. I have tried to live my life that way, throughout my life.\nI've not led a perfect life. I don't think anybody has. I'm not Mother Teresa. However, I have tried to do right by people who have been in need. And some of that doing right by people recently has gotten me where I am here today.\nBut in order to try to put perspective some of the stories that have been out there over the last several days involving a Guatemalan woman whom I took into my home in the early 1990s, who came from a very abusive relationship, who fled Guatemala at a the time of turmoil in that country, who landed in the United States knowing no one and having no friends and having no place to live and no way to support herself, I was asked by a friend if I would, in fact, provide her a room in my home and try to help her so that she could get back on her feet and eventually return to her family in Guatemala. And I did that.\nAnd I did that even at the time knowing that there was some risk to me in doing it. And I have to say to you today that knowing everything that has happened over the last week, that if that woman showed up at my door, if I was asked by a friend to do that again, I would do it in an instant, without hesitation.\nI'd like to introduce some people to you today who have some stories to tell. And I have never been one who has been very public about the things I do for other people, but I thought it was necessary in order to give some perspective to this story, to introduce some of these people to you today.\nThe first person I want to introduce to you today is Margarita Viadoris (ph). Margarita (ph) has known me, I guess, probably longer than any of the other people up here, other than my family. And Margarita (ph) if you'll step forward and say a few words.\nMARGARITA VIADORIS (ph): I've known Linda for about 23 years. And when I met her, you know, I hardly spoke any English. I was, you know, starting my life in this country, so she supported me in all the ways. She encouraged me to go to school. She encouraged me also to become a citizen. She also helped me to get my first job in the federal government.\nThanks to her, today I have a good life. My kids are in college. You know, I have a good job in the federal government.\nI always will be, you know, grateful to Linda and Chris, both of them. They are a family who will help anybody, no matter who the person is in time of needs. No matter what they problem, you know, they're always there.\nUp to now, she always have call me sometimes to make sure that my kids are doing well in school, that my family is fine.\nYou know she's always, you know, concerned about me and all the people that she knows. That's all I have to say.\nCHAVEZ: Benson Bui (ph), if you would come forward, please?\nBENSON BUI (ph): My name is Benson Bui (ph) from South Vietnam. I come into from 1979. I just say only three things. The first thing is that if I don't have Linda Chavez, so that mean I don't have everything today, because she help me when I come down here with my young brother. And she teach me everything for the customs of American people and help me go to school and to get opportunity today.\nMyself and all my family right now and my children--so I don't know what I say but I with hope in my heart right now. That's all I want to say. Thank you.\nCHAVEZ: I'd also now like to ask Ada Iterino (ph) to come forward and to talk. And I don't know if you want to have Josh (ph) and Selenia (ph) say anything, but Ada (ph) come forward.\nADA ITERINO (ph): Hi. I'm Ada Iterino (ph), and I met Linda Chavez about 10 years ago. She's been very helpful in my life, especially with my children. She helped them to give them a better education. I'm very thankful for that, and also she encouraged me in a lot of things, especially in my motivations to go back to school, prepare myself, that there's a future, letting me know that there's a future for me and myself and for my children also.\nAnd I'm very thankful for that.\nNow, this is my family. This is Joshua, this is Christen Selenia (ph).\nThank you.\nJOSHUA REYES (ph): Hi, my name is Joshua Reyes (ph). I'm from Queens. You know, since the first time I met Linda, I mean, I was, kind of, afraid, I was, kind of, nervous, you know, what things she would do. I mean, but, you know, the family that she has was very loving and, you know, I really appreciated what she done. The thing is that I call her sometimes my mother because the things that she done, you know, explaining the natures and that stuff, and I was really thankful, you know, to have a family like them in their life.\nAnd, you know, I am grateful; you know, I'm honored and I'm grateful to say, you know, thank you so much, you know, for all the life that I've ever had.\nThank you so much.\nCHRISTEN SELENIA RUIZ ALTERENA (ph): Hi, my name is Christen Selenia Ruiz Alterena (ph), and I just want to say that I love Linda very much. She has been doing a lot of things in my life. And I just want to say that she's like a second--that she's like a second mother for me. And I hope that she has a good life in the future.\nCHAVEZ: Thank you very much.\nI don't know if we're going to be hearing from Dr. David Bowden (ph). Dr. Bowden (ph) and I have never met. He is on an airplane coming here from Florida. He called I guess it was yesterday or sent us an e-mail and said that he wanted to help.\nI've never met Dr. Bowden (ph). But back when I was in the White House, he was engaged to a Mexican woman who had inadvertently during the process of her legalization gone home, I guess to visit her family. And was then informed that because she had left the country during this very critical period was not going to be allowed to return and had, in fact, jeopardized her citizenship. And we have a letter here available if you'd like to read it.\nHe wrote his congressman, David Bonior. He wrote his senator, Carl Levin. They said, \"Sorry, we can't help.\" At some point, somebody got him to write to the president of the United States, and I don't know exactly how it happened, but that letter ended up on my desk. And I picked up the telephone and called him and said, \"I will do what I can.\" And I called the INS on his behalf, I called the Department of Justice.\nAnd the long and short of the story is that Dr. Bowden's (ph) fiance was, in fact, allowed to return, they were able to get married, they have been married now for about 16 years. And I, frankly, had totally forgotten about this story until I guess it was in August, August of 2000, I got a thank you letter from him.\nSomehow he had come on to my web site, found out where I was and wanted to write me to tell me what an impact I had had in his life. So if Dr. Bowden (ph) gets here, maybe he'll have a few words to say. And I certainly would love to meet him.\nI am here today, in part with the folks around me, to try to put a human face on a story. But I'm am also here because I think that what has happened over the last few days is quite typical of what happens in Washington, D.C., and unfortunately is very typical of what has happened in politics in America today. And I believe that what has happened is part of what we've seen over the last several years of the politics of personal destruction, is the phrase.\nI believe that I would have made a great secretary of labor. I believe that President Bush is going to make a great president. I worked very, very hard for his election, and I want his administration to succeed.\nUnfortunately, because of the way in which the stories have played over the last few days, the fact that all of you have made, I think, a great deal more of this story than need be, and have, in my view, not told the story of some of the people around me, I have decided that I am becoming a distraction, and therefore I have asked President Bush to withdraw my name for secretary of labor.\nI do this with some regret, because I think that it is a very, very bad signal to all of those good people out there who want to serve their government and want to serve the people of the United States. But so long as the game in Washington is a game of search-and-destroy, I think we will have very few people who are willing to do what I did, which was to put myself through this in order to serve.\nI want to thank you.\nI would be happy to take a question or two.\nQUESTION: Ms. Chavez, did you decide yourself to withdraw your name...\nCHAVEZ: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: ... or were you asked by the campaign?\nCHAVEZ: At no time was I ever asked by the campaign. What I decided was that this was a distraction, and that this administration needs to get about the business of forming a government and getting on with governing the United States.\nQUESTION: Do you believe that Zoe Baird was the victim of the politics of personal destruction and a search-and-destroy mission?\nCHAVEZ: In terms of Zoe Baird, the circumstances of Zoe Baird are quite different from the circumstances involving me.\nI do believe that Zoe Baird was treated unfairly. I think the American people, as you may recall--I've actually gone back and read the news stories on this and gone back to the contemporaneous stories--the American people, largely because of talk on talk radio, began complaining about Ms. Baird and her chauffeur and her live-in maid. And that, I think, was what happened.\nI have not, by the way, seen that kind of reaction in terms of the stories that have been out there about me. I have not seen a, kind of, grassroots furor. Quite the contrary, I think there has been a, kind of, grassroots support.\nI don't know what Zoe Baird's circumstances were, but I can tell you that my relationship with Marta was quite different, I believe, than Zoe Baird's with her employees, and I can certainly assure you that the people around here can attest that my relationship with Marta was nothing unique, but that was a pattern that I have had throughout my entire adult life.\nQUESTION: When did Marta Mercado tell you that she was actually here illegally?\nCHAVEZ: She remembers that she told me after she'd been in my house about three months.\nI will be very frank with you. I think I always knew that she was here illegally. I don't check green cards when I see a woman who is battered and who has no place to live and nothing to eat and no way to get on her feet.\nQUESTION: Did you also help her get a job with your next-door neighbor?\nCHAVEZ: I helped her in every way that I could. I drove her places to look for work. I drove her to English classes. I taught her to use the bus. I did a lot of things for her that I would do for anybody in those circumstances.\nQUESTION: Did you tell the Bush people that you had housed an illegal immigrant in your home during your vetting process?\nCHAVEZ: I did come to tell them that. I did not volunteer it in our very first conversation.\nAs some of you may know, the vetting process for nominations in this current administration are quite different than the vetting in previous administrations. And I should know something about that; I've been vetted many times before.\nNormally what happens when you have someone under consideration, even after you have selected them, is that you go through a vetting procedure and it is done before that person's name is public.\nIn this particular administration, because of the circumstances of the Florida election, this administration has not had that normal procedure, has not been able to do that. And so they are working at some disadvantage.\nOne more question, one more.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: Do you think you made any mistake at all?\nCHAVEZ: Absolutely. Did I make a mistake--absolutely. I made the mistake of not thinking through that this might be misinterpreted and coming forward with it at the first available opportunity.\nI will tell you that the time period that elapsed between the very first discussion with anyone about my nomination, after I was--actually, before I was selected, was less than a week. I had a matter of a few days. And as I say, the normal vetting procedure--when I've been through full field investigations in the past, the normal procedure last anywhere from two weeks to six weeks.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2001-01-09", "title": "News Conference by Linda Chavez Announcing Withdrawal for Consideration for the Office of Secretary of Labor"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84909", "text": "FLEISCHER: Good afternoon.\nSeveral announcements today, some new White House personnel to report.\nPresident-elect Bush is today pleased to announce his intention to name Dan Bartlett as deputy assistant to the president and deputy to the counselor; John Bridgeland as deputy domestic policy adviser and director of the Domestic Policy Council; Tucker Eskew as deputy assistant to the president for media affairs; and Ken Mellman (ph) as deputy assistant to the president for political affairs and White House political director.\nThose are our four personnel announcements.\nIn terms of an update on hearing schedules, several Cabinet designees are up on the Hill today meeting with a bipartisan group of senators, as individuals, in courtesy calls. They are designate O'Neill, Veneman, Martinez, Abraham, Norton, Paige and Principi.\nAnd we have one new announcement of a hearing date that has been released from the Senate, and that is Mel Martinez's hearing will be on January 17, at the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\nSo to recap where we are with our upcoming hearings: Secretary of Education-designate Paige, January 10, tomorrow; Designate Rumsfeld, January 11; Colin Powell, the 16th; Christie Todd Whitman, the 16th; Spence Abraham, 18th; and Gale Norton, the 18th.\nAnd as a reminder, those are as announced by the Senate. It's the Senate's prerogative, of course, to choose the hearing date for each of the nominees. They announce them as the Senate sees appropriate and fit.\nAnd one final item, and I'll be pleased to take questions, is the rÃ©sumÃ© count. We are surging once more. And we are up to 45,314 rÃ©sumÃ©s have been sent in to the transition team.\nQUESTION: Ari, Linda Chavez has announced a news conference for this afternoon at 4:00. Is she going to withdraw?\nFLEISCHER: I have heard that from media accounts that she was going to have or is going to have a press event this afternoon. And as is my practice throughout the campaign and the transition with any announcements that President-elect Bush would make, for example, I don't presume to indicate ahead of time what anybody may or may not announce.\nQUESTION: Should she withdraw?\nFLEISCHER: I am not going to speculate on that topic. President-elect Bush, of course, as you know, yesterday said that he has full confidence in her. President-elect Bush has confidence in Linda Chavez.\nQUESTION: Just one more, if I may. Was the president-elect aware when he said that yesterday twice that she had had a conversation with the neighbor who also hired Ms. Mercado after she had been notified of a possible nomination?\nFLEISCHER: We addressed that this morning. And that is part of the whole fact-gathering process that has been in place. That is the same process for each and every one of our nominees, where as any information comes to light it's evaluated during the course of the many steps of a vetting process.\nSo any information of that nature gets fully vetted and reviewed as information comes to light.\nQUESTION: But you can't say whether he knew yesterday?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not going to get into the exact timing of what the president-elect may have known or not known. And, again, we have a process that's in place, and I think it's a very thorough vetting process and I'm not going to presume to predict any events this afternoon. Any announcements that she wants to make are of course up to her.\nQUESTION: Has the president-elect spoken with Ms. Chavez today or yesterday?\nFLEISCHER: Not to my knowledge. I have no information on that.\nQUESTION: Ari, you might have to look into this, but have any male nominees in any administration ever been forced to withdraw because of this nanny-gate situation? Has it always been the women nominees?\nFLEISCHER: I would have to refer you to someone else to try to find that information.\nQUESTION: Is it possible you could look into it? It is a really valid question of discrimination.\nFLEISCHER: I'll do my best. That's also a matter, I'm sure, that some scholars, historians, others can be equally helpful.\nQUESTION: Are men asked the same question about employees, illegal employees?\nFLEISCHER: Our clearing counsel makes no distinction by gender in terms of the questions he asks or the information that comes to light. We work with all information provided to make certain that everything is as accurate as it can be, regardless of gender.\nQUESTION: Ari, I have a question Ms. Chavez was asked on her questionnaire regarding domestic help.\nFLEISCHER: I would refer you to the Office of Personnel Management. Those questionnaires are available from them. It's a rather lengthy questionnaire. I would not presume, if I were you, that any such question is on the questionnaire itself. That's a government form of long standing. I refer you to that. You'll be able to get it online.\nQUESTION: Ari, you said that President-elect Bush has confidence in Linda Chavez. Does that mean he believes she will be nominated and would be a good labor secretary, still?\nFLEISCHER: He indeed believes she would be a good labor secretary, of course.\nQUESTION: Can you assess for us the president-elect's level of concern about these questions that have been raised about her dealings with the formerly illegal immigrant?\nFLEISCHER: I would think it's ongoing. I mean, I think any time questions are asked and raised, that is part of the process that he has set up to make certain that all answers are thoroughly explored. And so any time any questions come up about Ms. Chavez or any nominee, the president's concern is that they be fully addressed.\nQUESTION: What is his level of concern, though, about these specific questions?\nFLEISCHER: I indicated that. It's ongoing. It's ongoing until we have all the facts at our disposal.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Ari, if the president-elect supports the illegal amnesty or amnesty for illegal immigrants?\nFLEISCHER: Say again?\nQUESTION: If he supports or favors amnesty for illegal immigrants.\nFLEISCHER: That was not part of what he discussed during the campaign.\nQUESTION: There was an unconfirmed report about another of the women nominees. Anything on that? I don't want to mention names if it's unconfirmed.\nFLEISCHER: Be hard pressed, unless I was Karnak, to answer your question about a nominee if you don't give me the name.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) but I mean have you heard of any of this or anything else in the wind?\nFLEISCHER: Do you have something you would like to offer?\nQUESTION: Well, the unconfirmed report I heard was Christie Todd Whitman, and I just heard it on the air. I don't even know.\nFLEISCHER: Yes. There was actually AP report that went out yesterday about a 1993 old news story involving Christie Todd Whitman and the payment of taxes she made at the time in 1993. And I think that matter was pretty well discussed publicly and fully dealt with, openly and voluntarily, by Governor Whitman eight years ago.\nQUESTION: So it's not an issue, then?\nFLEISCHER: No.\nQUESTION: Ari, don't you guys and the president-elect feel somewhat blindsided by this? This is something that didn't have to happen.\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, when you say blindsided by this, that is part of the ongoing vetting process. And we have a process, and I explained this yesterday, it's really a three-part process, and that will continue.\nAnd I think that, frankly, that's going to be what previous presidents have done, what future presidents do, you work with the information as best you can gather it. And what's important is that you have a process that is willing and open and acceptant of any new information that may come to light. As it comes to light, you evaluate it.\nQUESTION: But I guess the question really is, you had a vetting process. If played out as it did, this still happened. So what about the appointee who isn't forthcoming enough with information?\nFLEISCHER: Well, that's precisely the point of a process that is ongoing. And it's not as if there's only one step in the process, there are several steps in the process to make certain that all information that comes to light is thoroughly reviewed.\nQUESTION: Again, the bottom-line question, though, is whether you're disappointed that it has gotten to this stage?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I'm not going to characterize it. We are where we are. And we're going to proceed and put together a Cabinet that I think the American people are going to be proud of.\nThat is the vetting process. And it's a process that has several parts and works and we think works well.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Ari, the (OFF-MIKE) question of the day here, but did anybody ask you--you're not Senate confirmable--did anybody ask you during this process whether you had had domestic help? And how did you answer the question?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not going to get into the specifics of any one individual, especially my own. I'm not going to get into the actual questions anybody was asked.\nAs you know, the president-elect makes his decisions and then those are reviewable.\nQUESTION: Ari, why do you think there's been so many confusion about exactly when Ms. Chavez knew of Marta Mercado's legal status in the country?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think that, obviously, different people have different memories of events, and that is part and parcel of the human condition. People remember things differently.\nBut what is important is that you put together a process to help review it all. And that if there are any pieces of information that are not entirely consistent with each other, you put the process together to figure out which is which.\nQUESTION: Just a follow-up, you talked about this a little this morning, but what is the campaign or the transition's current understanding of when exactly she did know of Ms. Mercado's legal status?\nFLEISCHER: At some point, and that point has not exactly been nailed down.\nQUESTION: And has she told you or the FBI, Ms. Chavez, this?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not going to be able to describe to you. Of course, she has told the FBI.\nQUESTION: Was it proper for Ms. Chavez to contact her neighbor, Ms. Zwisler, to discuss the fact of Marta Mercado's mutual relationship with the two of them after she was aware that she might be nominated?\nFLEISCHER: I think that all goes to the facts of the matter are they're being gathered. Certainly neighbors contact neighbors all the time. Neighbors talk to neighbors all the time. So I think what you're getting at is what was the substance of those contacts, and that's part of the fact gathering.\nQUESTION: Doesn't it at least raise the appearance of some sort of impropriety?\nFLEISCHER: I think, again, that gets right to the basic issue of what are facts. What was said, what was not said and of course, we don't know what was said. That's why we have a vetting process to gather the facts, so we know what's said.\nQUESTION: Ari, on the question asked earlier about whether Bush had spoken to Chavez, you said that not to your knowledge. Earlier, you said it had not been brought to your attention.\nFLEISCHER: Same answer.\nQUESTION: Is it possible that Bush, in fact has spoken to her and you're unaware of it?\nAnd if I could ask a follow on on that.\nFLEISCHER: Well, of course I'm not aware of every phone conversation he has. But I would urge you, do not interpret that to leave the door open as if, yes, it happened. But you've asked me a question that I'm only give you if I have 100 percent certainty on the answer. But nothing's been brought to my attention. I'm not aware of it.\nQUESTION: Can I ask a broader question? As the incoming president's designated press spokesman, how often do you talk to Mr. Bush? Or how are you informed of his thinking on a daily basis?\nFLEISCHER: I talk to him regularly, as often as necessary. Clearly, with the president-elect being in Texas and me being here, he has other staff in Texas who he's in much more frequent contact with. And I speak with, obviously, all the people I need to speak with here on a regular basis, including Vice President-elect Cheney on a daily basis.\nQUESTION: When did you last talk to President-elect Bush?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not going to tick-tock my conversations with the president. I don't think that's necessary. But I appreciate the question.\nQUESTION: If Ms. Chavez sought advice from the Bush team, would you encourage her to hang in there or would you leave it up to her?\nFLEISCHER: Again, I am not aware--what she's going to say later this afternoon.\nAs I said earlier, the way I handle these issues when the president-elect speaks, when anybody speaks, I think you're aware of our campaign practices, that anybody who has what they want to say, we don't typically preview it on their behalf. So I'm not aware of any changes in our policies that would make me all of a sudden do something differently than I've been doing all year with the campaign.\nQUESTION: Just to put a slightly finer point on it, I wasn't asking you to change any policies. I was just asking whether the Bush team would leave it up to Ms. Chavez or would they give her advice to hang in there?\nFLEISCHER: Let me reiterate the president-elect has confidence in Linda Chavez and her ability to be a good secretary of labor, a strong secretary of labor.\nQUESTION: Is the president-elect in the incoming administration developing a response or a policy to the electricity in deregulation and power crisis in California? Yesterday the governor of California, who will be here today meeting with Clinton administration people, announced some fairly severe measures. But at the same time Republican lawmakers in California were calling for even stronger measures to bring this crisis to heal.\nFLEISCHER: The president-elect's focus is on a comprehensive national energy policy. Obviously there are a series of short-term problems that we face in this country. The reason we have these short-term problems in California and other places is because there is no long-term policy in effect.\nThe president-elect, in September, announced a plan that is focused on the fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. And his focus, so that we never will again have to go through these short-term problems that are as severe as they are, people paying extraordinary bills with their home heating and electricity, is that we increase America's domestic supply of oil, of natural gas, coal, clean-burning coal technologies.\nThere are a host of things we can do here at home to reduce our reliance on foreign supplies of oil and energy which are often unsteady, and in addition, to make certain--such as opening up ANWR, opening up 8 percent of a very large land area of Alaska, we're talking a sliver of the land, to open it up in an environmentally balanced way so that we can secure America's energy needs. That's his focus.\nOne of the reasons that we keep getting into these short-term energy problems is because nobody focused on the long term. And I think one of the voters' real frustrations with Washington is too much short-term focus, not enough long-term thinking, and he'd like to change that.\nQUESTION: Is Bush meeting with Davis this week?\nFLEISCHER: No, he's not.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nFLEISCHER: Not that I've heard. I inquired to see if there were any requests to set up meetings, particularly with Governor Davis, if they had sought any meetings, and nothing has been brought to my attention.\nSo of course we'll--I know the president-elect and Governor Davis did speak, oh, about two weeks ago or so, I think just a little bit over two weeks ago. There are some real concerns in California and we need to work together to address them.\nQUESTION: On the energy question, Ari, the president-elect takes office in the dead of winter with natural gas prices up by 50 percent and more. I know what your long-term solution is. What's the short-term solution?\nFLEISCHER: The immediate short-term solution is to make certain that those people who live on the edges of society, who most need help, get the help they need. And that's why the president-elect supports the LIHEAP program, and he supported increased funding for LIHEAP and the release of the money that has been backlogged in LIHEAP, so we can get help to those who need it most.\nBut the only way to avert these short-term problems is to have a government that is serious about first enacting a long-term solution. If you have a government that is only focused on the short term, you never get to the long term, and therefore you lurch from one short-term energy crisis to another.\nAnd again, that's one of the things that the president-elect views as a serious problem with the way Washington too often does its business. And you need to have that comprehensive, longer-term focus, despite the pressures, of course, that will grow to say, \"Only focus on the short term, let's do what we can now.\"\nTo do only what you can do now, you're going to be doing it again in another couple of years, and that's not where he wants this issue to go.\nQUESTION: On OPEC, do you have any statements to make to OPEC? I know you're talking with one voice on foreign policy.\nFLEISCHER: Well, of course, OPEC is scheduled to meet on January 17, and it's widely speculated they're going to be cutting back production at that time, which is another reason why we need to develop America's natural resources.\nFor example, knowing that on January 17 we're going to be pinched even more by OPEC, it makes it even more important that Americans join together in a bipartisan way so that we can develop our own resources, including ANWR. Failure to develop ANWR, an OPEC cutback, all of this suggests more difficult days in achieving America's energy independence and America's energy security, one more reason we need to have a domestic energy policy that is balanced and produces America energy for American citizens.\nQUESTION: Do you know if the new administration will support alternative fuels, tax breaks for alternative fuel development and that sort of thing?\nFLEISCHER: In the president's proposal on energy, one of the things that he announced was that the royalties that will be developed as a result of ANWR and the bid bonuses that will be developed from ANWR, as well as if there is any exploration or development of energy resources from other federal lands in the lower 48, that that money be earmarked for the development of alternative resources, alternative fuels. Yes, and that's part of a balanced approach.\nI think it's also a wonderful example of how we can develop America's fossil fuel energies and use the resources that come into the government as a result to develop alternative sources of fuel energy. I think that's balanced and it's in our national interest.\nQUESTION: The foreign policy--energy, in the next administration, has there any discussion to increase the oil imports from Mexico and decrease the oil import from Venezuela, a country where the president is not kind of friendly with this country so far. He's trying to be different.\nFLEISCHER: If the question is about specific oil imports nation-by-nation, I'm going to refer that to the Department of Energy.\nQUESTION: You offered a list of nominees making courtesy calls on the Hill today.\nFLEISCHER: Yes.\nQUESTION: You didn't mention Governor Thompson and Senator Ashcroft the press saw here in the building. Are they here having confirmations...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: Well, Senator Ashcroft, of course, has already made his courtesy calls on the Hill. And over the course of several days, I've released a lot of the names of the people who are going up there. So don't presume because they didn't go up today, they haven't gone. In Ashcroft's case, they've already been.\nQUESTION: Concerning Ashcroft and Thompson here today, are they meeting with Vice President-elect Cheney's strategy here?\nFLEISCHER: All our Cabinet officers have offices in this building, and so they work out of here. They have offices, they have support staffs here.\nIn fact I was walking down--there is a hallway, I call it \"Cabinet Row,\" where each of them has an office. Of course, there are none of the giant buildings.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nFLEISCHER: Well, if I told you, you would walk around the corner and try to find them. It's in a non-public part of the building.\nBut they all have offices here, so they work out of here on a regular basis.\nQUESTION: Does President-elect Bush plan to meet with his Cabinet nominees this evening?\nFLEISCHER: This evening? No.\nQUESTION: Ari, can I ask you a question about an invitation by the president-elect to the former president of Argentina to be here for the...\nFLEISCHER: You asked that yesterday. I don't believe we have an answer for you yet on that. Scott McClellan, I think, was looking into that, and so you may want to call Scott later, but we do not have that developed yet.\nQUESTION: You indicated that you heard about the Chavez press release through media accounts. Is this how the transition team and the president-elect heard of her intention to have a press release this afternoon?\nFLEISCHER: Well, you're asking about others as well. You asked me--how I heard. And the first I heard of it was through a media account.\nQUESTION: And how about the president-elect?\nFLEISCHER: I haven't asked him how he heard about it.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Ari, I'm sure you're aware that a panoply of human and civil rights organizations and women's advocacy groups...\n(CROSSTALK)\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: ... all got together at the Mayflower Hotel today, and they announced their intention to defeat Mr. Ashcroft. Does this increase your level of concern? And at what point do you start answering their complaint that Senator Ashcroft is too extreme for the nation?\nFLEISCHER: Well, let me say that those groups, of course, have the right to do that. That is part of our country, that they can do that.\nThe United States Senate has never defeated a Cabinet member on the basis of ideology alone. That's a long-standing bipartisan tradition.\nNow I understand that these liberal special-interest groups may not be as interested in those bipartisan traditions that the United States Senate has established and have worked so well for our nation throughout the course of many administrations. That is their right to object to these bipartisan traditions. But the president-elect is going to be a president for all of the people, for the whole country, and he's going to continue to work with the United States Senate in a bipartisan tradition.\nSo they are free to engage in partisan events if they so choose, but that is, I think, not the lesson of the last election. And President-elect Bush is going to govern in a way that continues to seek to bring people together.\nQUESTION: If you'd like to follow up--does this--by all of these groups getting together like this, does this turn up, in your opinion, the pressure on Democratic senators to line up against Mr. Ashcroft?\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, I think there's some very powerful bipartisan traditions that call for a president getting the Cabinet that he seeks, that there is deference to the president in terms the Cabinet-level personnel when it comes to ideology. That is one long-standing tradition of the Senate that has not been broken.\nI would remind you that President Clinton, from 1995 forward, named, I believe it was in excess of six or eight members to the United States Cabinet, each of who was confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, despite strong ideological opposition and, again, at the Cabinet level.\nNow, there are some real liberal stalwarts in that group. Yet, that bipartisan tradition was honored by Republicans.\nSo, again, it is the right of the liberal special interest groups to oppose as they see fit, but those longstanding bipartisan traditions of the Senate should be dealt with very, very carefully.\nQUESTION: Would you point to Bork, of course, not a Cabinet member, but an extremely important appointment, and wasn't Bork rejected for his viewpoints?\nFLEISCHER: And he was, he was. And that was really the first time ideology came into play in that manner. And this is part of coarsening of the tone in Washington. It's one of the reasons we need to change the tone in Washington.\nIt was reported last week that many of these groups are engaging in their partisan opposition because as they said, wanted to raise money for their causes and to warm-up, as they said, for the next battle. That's part of what's wrong with Washington. If everybody is warming up for the next battle, then Washington is always in a battle.\nAnd that's one reason that President-elect Bush wants to change the tone in Washington.\nQUESTION: Can you give us a little more detail on this issue with USTR? You said that you're reviewing this. How close are they in coming to a decision on the person and their role?\nFLEISCHER: As you know, with all our Cabinet announcements, or announcements that--you know, EPA, for example, the president-elect named Christie Todd Whitman to be the administrator of the EPA, she will have Cabinet ranking.\nAnd as he makes his announcements, he makes other announcements that come along with those announcements. So I would just suggest to you: Keep your powder dry on that front.\nPresident-elect Bush is a real fighter for free trade. He understands the importance to our economy. He understands the importance to help other nations grow their economies, that stems from free trade in a vigorous promotion of free trade around the world. That's the cause he's dedicated to, and his selections will be reflective of his dedication to free trade.\nQUESTION: Will he devolved in reviewing what role the USTR will play, whether it's Cabinet or sub-Cabinet? Or is Don Evans involved in that review process? Or who's making decisions?\nFLEISCHER: You know, let me try to get back to you on the exact people who are involved in it. Of course, related to the Cabinet selections, it's our normal transition group. And, of course, you know, policy people weigh in and such.\nBut I also believe that most of the Cabinet members are a little busy just working on their own nominations and have their heads down, but I'll try to get you some more information.\nQUESTION: Ari, more than 100 people so far contributed $100,000 each to the Inaugural Committee. What do those people expect in terms of attention by President Bush once he becomes president?\nFLEISCHER: You know, that is a long-standing part of inaugurals. And it's been practiced widely. We disclose it all, which I think is terribly important. We were the first campaign to instantly disclose, and that's a policy that we continued right through the Florida recount, that we've continued in the transition and in the inaugural. And I think what they can expect is good government.\nI want to make another point, too, that for a lot of the events we're holding, there are going to be a lot of people, a lot of younger people, a lot of people who don't have a lot of money to make ends meet, and the price of their tickets is going to be lower as a result of some of these contributions.\nNow it's been done different ways. Previously there were limits put on it, but then what you had were special interest groups buying up gigantic blocks of tickets that they never used. It was just another way of getting large contributions in. This is I think a very open, direct and fully disclosed way, and I think the inaugural will be better for it.\nAnd I think that all the attendees are going to have an enjoyable inaugural as a result.\nQUESTION: Any special consideration? Any special attention?\nFLEISCHER: No different from anybody else. The president-elect makes his decisions about policies based on what he thinks is right for the nation.\nQUESTION: I noticed that a lot of the people who went to his conferences on economics last week were big donors. What connection is there between donors and being selected to go to those events?\nFLEISCHER: We make no distinctions about people on the basis of whether they've given or not. We don't review that information when people are invited. And I would refer you to the meeting on the faith-based leaders who came to Austin and met with President Bush. I dare say a number of them didn't vote for him, let alone give to him.\nAnd that's part of how he's going to govern. We're going to be bringing together a wide variety of groups of people. And we don't ask what their donor status is. We don't ask who they voted for.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Ari, clearly part of the problem--going back on the energy issues--clearly part of the problem with California is that it's very difficult to get a permit to build a new power plant for environmental concerns. I don't think a new power plant's been built in California for something like 15 years.\nThe same issue applies to refineries. Under the Bush administration, will the process of permitting things like power plants, refineries, be eased in such a way that you can actually build something like that in this country?\nFLEISCHER: You know, I would refer you to his energy speech that he gave up in Michigan. That was, indeed, part of it. He did talk about helping to make sure that--let me find the exact words if I have them right here, otherwise I'll just refer you to it.\nYes, I'm going to refer you on this one. There was a section of the speech where he did discuss the need to make certain that we were able to increase our refining capacity, for example, our generating capacity. And one of the items he talked about--let me walk you through a few of them--was improving the regulatory process to encourage more refining capacity and to limit regulatory overlap.\nIt's that overlap that is very often resulted in a position where people stop building, because they couldn't get any electricity generation going and that defeats the purpose of having an energy policy if you don't have the means to deliver or refine the energy that you develop. And that means higher prices for American consumers.\nPipeline transportation. One of the things the president-elect talked about in that speech was requiring FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy to develop a comprehensive policy for pipeline transportation.\nOf course, people remember in the summer the gigantic spike-up in prices of gasoline in the Midwest. There were a variety of causes for it, but pipeline problems were one of them.\nAgain, if you develop your resources but you don't have the means to get them to the market, you haven't developed the resources. If you develop your resources but--in addition to not getting them to the market, you don't have the refining capacity, if you import oil. But the capacity utilization is running at 96, 97, 98, 99 percent. You cannot get any more energy to the American people.\nAnd that's why what's required is a balanced approach to our energy needs. Otherwise, the American people are going to pay sky high prices for energy and they won't like it.\nQUESTION: Let's shift to the Pentagon for a minute, please.\nWe're coming down to a head on whether the Pentagon should go ahead and authorize initial low-rate production of the F-22 fighter aircraft. There is something called the Defense Acquisition Board, which may meet as early as this week or next, ahead of the inauguration, to make a multi-billion dollar decision.\nI wonder if you know whether your team supports this decision being made before you take office on January 20?\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, any decisions that are made before January 20--we're respectful of the president's prerogatives. As I said, we respect the fact that he is the president through January 20, and I'm certain that he is respectful and will be respectful of prerogatives President-elect Bush takes upon assuming office.\nAfter January 20, on a question like that, you may bring it up. I may refer you to DOD at the time.\nQUESTION: Well, it's just that Richard Armitage, a military adviser to President-elect Bush, has been quoted in The Washington Post as saying he thinks that that is something that should be put off until after January 20, since we're so close to when the new administration takes office.\nFLEISCHER: Is that Mr. Armitage on your phone now?\n(LAUGHTER)\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: But my question is whether that accurately reflects the views of the incoming administration. Would the administration like...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: I've not read Mr. Armitage's remarks, and so I would hesitate to comment on them.\nQUESTION: Another Cabinet issue: Are we going to get--or any closer to getting some deputy treasury secretaries named?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, we are at the stage now where any day we could have additional personnel announcements in the undersecretary, deputy secretary--the sub-Cabinet level. And those will be announcements made by the president-elect, and I'll keep you informed whenever they're made.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: A question about the transition office: When would you or can you invite the media, TV, I'm sure? I mean, we have been requesting--we want to have some view of how you work on the other floors. Now you have Cabinet members' rooms upstairs. We, the people of the United States, want to know how they look like. I mean...\nFLEISCHER: No, we did that extensively out in McLean, and maybe what we can do if there's sufficient media interest, we'll try to pick one moment and set up some type of organized tour for the cameras. Maybe we'll pool it.\nSo I'm aware of your requests. Frankly, we have got a whole lot of requests. Maybe we will now.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: ... maybe the networks have requested as well and inundated with many requests, therefore she can't deal with our specific request. That's the answer that we have.\nFLEISCHER: Well, as I indicated, if there's enough demand for it, if we want to bore a lot of producers, we'll be happy to take them around our fine offices.\nQUESTION: Ten more days, and this office has been open for a little while now.\nFLEISCHER: OK.\nQUESTION: So hopefully this week. That's what I heard.\nQUESTION: Ari, has president-elect decided to keep the office of special envoy of the United States for the Americas? He has any names in mind to that post?\nFLEISCHER: That, like all personnel announcements, will be--if there is anything to say, we will say at the time.\nQUESTION: What are the president-elect's thoughts about cutting taxes across the board and making it retroactive to January 1 of this year, as Majority Leader Armey has suggested today in a memo? And my understanding is a lot of leaders on Capital Hill are asking.\nFLEISCHER: On the question of retroactive tax cuts, President-elect Bush is going to continue to monitor the strength of the economy, and he's going to continue to meet with his advisers and learn the latest. And he is very concerned about the strength of the economy.\nAs you know, he has three reasons principally to cut taxes.\nThe first is because if we don't, the politicians in Washington, as history shows, regardless of the party, will spend the money. Two, because, as he said throughout the campaign, the surplus belongs to the people, it's their money. And three, and he has said this now for more than one year, he believes it can also be an insurance policy against a future economic downturn.\nGiven the economic circumstances we're finding ourselves in, he is exploring what options he has to look at phase-in rates or effective dates. No decisions have been reached.\nQUESTION: Does he think the economy needs the surge that would be given by cutting taxes across the board and giving consumers more money to spend immediately?\nFLEISCHER: He does believe the economy needs a boost. He calls it an economic recovery plan.\nAnd one of the things--let me also address on the question of taxes.\nIn addition to effective dates, in addition to phase-ins, the certainty of a tax cut also has a boost to the economy. The very fact that consumers know that they will have more money in their pockets on a permanent basis allows them to have more resources, it allows them to pay down their debts, it gives them more money to spend and use as they see fit, not as the government decides.\nSo even without an immediate boost to the economy, the very fact that people know that it is done and it is permanent changes their ability to make their decisions down the road, because they know they're going to have more money.\nQUESTION: Ari, could I go back to Senator Ashcroft? Is the transition aware of any kind of marshaling of conservative forces in support of Senator Ashcroft? And does the transition believe that he needs such a marshaling of support?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I would say I've never been around a confirmation process where one side decided to go and the other side decided not to respond. So I can only imagine that that's inevitable, that's part of the way it works.\nQUESTION: Are you aware of such a marshaling taking place?\nFLEISCHER: I've heard some things. I don't think I could refer to you anything hard or specific. I'm sure if you dig not too very deep, you'll find it.\nQUESTION: Ari, the police say they're expecting the biggest protest crowd for an inauguration since '73. Do you have any comment on that?\nFLEISCHER: That is absolutely the right of the American people, and we understand that, and we will be very respectful of them. Of course, we expect they'll be very respectful of the president-elect.\nBut even with the protest, President-elect Bush has said that his job is to be president of all the people, and that's what he intends to do.\nQUESTION: Ari, do you have any schedule for remarks by the president-elect either tonight or tomorrow afternoon or both?\nFLEISCHER: Remarks tonight by the president?\nQUESTION: What he intends to do.\nFLEISCHER: No. I think he's just arriving, and I don't believe there are any remarks. He'll get into Andrews around I think it was 7:30, the last I heard, and arrive at Blair House at about 8:15.\nAnd tomorrow there'll be--I think the first public event will be at the Pentagon. We're going to have paper out this afternoon that has all the details of it.\nQUESTION: Any scheduled news conference?\nFLEISCHER: No.\nQUESTION: You're going to brief tomorrow at 10 as usual, or will that change with the president...\nFLEISCHER: If there are any changes, you'll be advised in the way of e-mail.\nQUESTION: Going back, Ari, to free trade. If President-elect Bush is in touch with the countries who has huge deficits or surplus with the United States, like China, if he's in touch or working on this, how he's going to deal with this problem?\nFLEISCHER: Well, of course, the trade deficit is an ongoing part of the job of the USTR, the United States Trade Representative. So of course it is a concern. With some nations we have trade surpluses, with some nations we have trade deficits. The overall balance of trade issue is part and parcel of the USTR's job. It's another reason we need fast track negotiating authority so we can address those imbalances.\nQUESTION: Ari, the head of the Forest Service has directed the government to do more to protect old trees. And he's going to be around for about three months after the new administration comes in. What's the plan for the new administration to take this project up?\nFLEISCHER: I have nothing for you on that.\nQUESTION: Ari, yesterday, former Senator Nunn said regarding, national missile defense, that he hoped the Bush administration would see it as a technology, not a theology.\nIs President-elect Bush of the mind today that this is an unproven technology? Of where is he on that?\nFLEISCHER: He's well-aware that it is a technology and that the technology has to be there to move forward. But he's also well-aware of what the power of the presidency can do to help people to arrive at solutions that allow that technology to be developed as quickly as is realistic.\nWe've all seen how it works. You can develop technology really slowly if you want, or you can develop technology quickly if you want. And he does believe that it is in the strategic best interest of the United States and to promote the peace that our nation have a missile defense system. And so he will make that a governing priority. And he's going to work with Democrats and Republicans alike to achieve it. That's one of the reasons he held the meeting yesterday.\nQUESTION: So he would perhaps be recommending an accelerated testing schedule?\nFLEISCHER: Well, as he announced in his speech on this topic in May at the National Press Club, he is going to dispatch the Pentagon and the best experts to work on what system is the best system. He did not, at that time, deliberately so define what he thought the best system was, because it's not a matter for the politicians to decide, whether it's sea-based, land-based, air-based. That is a question of technology, and that's why we have the experts.\nQUESTION: Does he have the feeling we're not moving fast enough on this?\nFLEISCHER: Indeed, he does. That's why he wants to push forward development of the national missile defense system to protect our nation.\nQUESTION: The president-elect, you say, classified his tax plan as being an economic recovery plan. Has he or his advisers indicated what kind of growth rate would represent economic recovery? Because in his father's administration, 2 or 3 percent (OFF-MIKE) growth would have been seen as a pretty healthy recovery. Is there any guidance you can give?\nFLEISCHER: Well, the president-elect has not and I don't expect that he will. That really is a question for economists. And I suspect that they will differ over that answer, if I know economists.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nFLEISCHER: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nFLEISCHER: I haven't put the question to them, but suffice it to say, the dramatic slowdown we've seen is, in the eyes of Democrats, Republicans, the private sector, all, a troubling sign.\nQUESTION: Ari, you've talked about the importance of fast track, getting fast track. What would you want to use fast track for? Would it be to bring Chile into the NAFTA? Or what specifically would he use it for?\nFLEISCHER: Well, as you know, once fast track is in place, then the executive has more authority to enter into trade agreements with other nations around the world. During the course of the campaign, the president discussed and promoted a free trade agreement of the Americas, I think he had a Western Hemisphere trade initiative. I'd be more than happy to give you more specifics or to go deeper.\nBut once fast track is in place, the executive is empowered to enter into those agreements. And what very often happens is that other nations, such as Chile, will enter into agreements with Canada in place of the United States because the fast-track trade negotiating authority isn't present and, therefore, America's negotiators are hamstrung at the negotiating table. If you don't have fast track, business goes to other countries.\nQUESTION: Well, Chile is already negotiating even without fast track. They've said they'll negotiate?\nFLEISCHER: Sure they are, but they were negotiating with us years and years ago. I remember in Congress in 1997 when fast track came up, we were negotiating with Chile at that time.\nIt makes it easier and if it's easier, you can get agreements faster.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: No, Chile--when fast-track was developed in 1997, when the vote initially came up and we didn't have the votes to do it, we pulled it from the Hill, we were all well-aware that Chile was entering into agreements with Canada at that time because they were unable to deal with us. We wanted to.\nNow, there are always trade discussions going on. They can take place outside the context of fast-track, it just makes it a lot harder.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Ari, (OFF-MIKE) programs were featured prominently in the campaigns, and I wanted to ask you about prescription drugs. I understand the helping-hand proposal might be the second bill that's sent to the Hill. And I wondered how you're going to reach out to Democrats and say that doesn't go far enough?\nAnd secondly, on Social Security, I wonder whether President-elect Bush will push for a commission to recommend a solution this year?\nFLEISCHER: OK. On the immediate helping hand, that is indeed the president's--he announced that is the second thing that he wanted to focus on. Improving education remains his top priority.\nAnd secondly, he talked during the campaign about the need to get prescription drugs to our nation's seniors through what he called his immediate helping hand proposal, which is a $48 billion program, I believe, to help the states develop a plan to get prescription drugs to needy seniors. That remains a priority of his.\nAnd throughout the process, of course, we're going to work with the Hill. This obviously has been a priority on the Hill for many years, although they have not been able to get it done. There's been too much fighting over that issue in Washington. And so I think you're going to see some healthy work between the executive and the legislature on getting prescription drugs to seniors.\nThe president-elect did announce his support for a commission on Social Security. He does believe that can be an effective way of getting people together to save Social Security.\nYou know, commissions sometimes work, sometimes they don't. But if there is a will, there is a way, and he seeks to create that will for Social Security.\nAnd of course, the last time there was major legislation enacted on Social Security was, in a good part, because of the 1983 Social Security Commission.\nSo there's a history of commissions working when the politicians want it to work.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2001-01-09", "title": "Afternoon Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer, Spokesman for the President-Elect"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84910", "text": "FLEISCHER: We are ready to take questions.\nQUESTION: I'm wondering if president-elect has spoken with Linda Chavez since the news of the Mercado relationship broke out.\nFLEISCHER: Nothing has been brought to my attention on that.\nQUESTION: I'd like to know if you can talk about the Wall Street Journal story today saying that Linda Chavez may have spoken to a neighbor before the nomination, discussing the Mercado relationship?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, I have noted the story and, as I mentioned yesterday, part of the ongoing vetting process is to look at a whole series of events and how information was developed and, as I indicated, that process is ongoing and that is one of the items that has been noted.\nQUESTION: Can I ask a follow-up, at least a first follow-up? Do you yet have a firm idea and are convinced in your mind when Linda Chavez knew--not suspected, but knew--that Mercado was in the U.S. illegally?\nFLEISCHER: That's the point of the vetting process. That's why we are seeking to develop information, and once we have something to share, we will endeavor to do so.\nQUESTION: And maybe my last follow-up: In retrospect, do you think it would have been wise for Linda Chavez to bring this whole issue up when she was interviewed to begin with?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not doing retros right now. We'll just, in as comprehensive a fashion as possible, gather all the information from the vetting process and take is as the information develops.\nQUESTION: Thanks, Ari.\nQUESTION: Hi Ari, I wanted to--maybe Dan--well, what's open and what's closed on Wednesday? And when there will be a list of the participants for the Thursday education event?\nFLEISCHER: As far as open-closed, we're going to have the arrival, there will be photo op at the Pentagon. And I think we're photo oping the tank. The departure will be photo op. And I'm not sure yet if there's going to be, you know, any type of a veil there or, we're still trying to work through that detail.\nThe education meeting, I anticipate having that list out, perhaps, today, no later than tomorrow. The meeting is Thursday morning, of course. So I'm just trying to get that in final form.\nAnd the times for all these meetings, as Dan indicated, as soon as we just have every, you know, having it all nailed down, it'll be in writing, and we'll get it to everybody as soon as it's done.\nQUESTION: Do you know where the meeting is--the education event is Thursday?\nFLEISCHER: No, the venue is not final.\nQUESTION: OK, thank you.\nQUESTION: Would it be appropriate for a nominee for a Cabinet level position to be contacting neighbors to discuss circumstances, such as we had with the Mercado case, yes or no?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think in this whole matter there were circumstances and facts are exactly what the vetting process is all about. And as that process develops, people are contacted and reached and the facts are developed, we'll have a fuller understanding of these events. So I leave that to the vetters.\nQUESTION: Is the Bush transition concerned, as the FBI appears to be that there may have been some attempt here to influence information that Ms. Swisler would have given to the FBI regarding the background check on Ms. Chavez?\nFLEISCHER: Again, I think that all depends on the facts. And there are obviously different takes on conversations. That's not a surprise to anybody. And memories of conversations are always subjective by all parties involved, which is why we have put in place a thorough and comprehensive vetting process. And as that process develops those facts, then we'll have something to say.\nQUESTION: And what is your understanding of the contact between Ms. Chavez and Ms. Mercado on Saturday night? As I understand it, Ms. Mercado tried to initiate contact. Do you know who got to who first?\nFLEISCHER: I really don't know much about that.\nQUESTION: All right, thank you.\nQUESTION: Want to ask you about an article in The Washington Post on the trade representative. Bill Thomas apparently is indicating that he's been assured by high-level officials in the transition that it will remain at Cabinet status. I wonder if you have anything for us on that?\nFLEISCHER: We're very well aware of the issues that have been raised in this regard. And obviously no decisions have been made about the USTR.\nWe are in the process of talking to various people about USTR, and it will all be made clear and public in short order, including what that person's Cabinet rank will be.\nQUESTION: So his spokesman is incorrect when he says that he has been assured--that they have been assured that it will be a Cabinet position?\nFLEISCHER: We are very well aware of the importance of this position and the importance of rank, and it will all be made plain for all to see at the time when the person is named.\nQUESTION: And just lastly, can we expect that this week?\nFLEISCHER: You know, I just can't speculate about the exact times of announcements, that type of thing. As you know, that's our standard procedure. But it's an important position. It's a position that will have to fight throughout the world for the president-elect's free trade positions. And the president-elect has every intention on moving on that position to afford it the priority it deserves.\nQUESTION: OK, thanks a lot.\nQUESTION: Hello, Ari. From what you know now--I'm going to take you back to the prior subject. From what you know now, do you think that Ms. Chavez has been forthcoming?\nAnd also, I'm wondering where the Republican senators are here, why none of them are standing with the president-elect in support of her?\nFLEISCHER: I'm going to try to interject that the previous subject was the USTR. You've got me all hyped up.\nLet me try to answer the process question here, which I think is on everybody's mind. It's a very legitimate question.\nI told everybody yesterday that people have their meeting with the clearing counsel. And then everybody fills out information. The FBI always does the background check, the field investigations. The Senate conducts its own.\nThe president-elect's approach to this and to all nominees is that when questions are raised, we will conduct as full and comprehensive a review of all the facts as is possible. And until we are able to complete that process, we're going to be reticent to comment, and I think that's in fairness to the nominee, it's in respect to the Senate, and it's the wisest approach to make certain that our process is a good one and a solid one to ensure that we have the best nominees to serve the country.\nWhat that unfortunately means is during the interim period between when these additional questions are raised and a comprehensive review is complete, we're not going to be able to further it substantially, and I'll do my best to help everybody and then to give you as much as I can of what you need.\nBut that is the president-elect's approach. I think people who worked with us during the campaign and the Florida recount, I think you saw us be somewhat reticent to get in front until we have developed as full and comprehensive set of facts as is possible.\nObviously, the political community is also interested in the development of that set of facts, and once we have it, we'll be able to move forward from there.\nQUESTION: But aren't you surprised that no Republican senators have come forward yet in support?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think, again, questions have been raised and everybody wants to know what the full facts are. But I'm not sure I would agree with your premise. I haven't done a laundry list myself, but I'm not sure I would agree with that premise.\nQUESTION: I'm willing to be proven wrong but I haven't seen anybody by name yet.\nFLEISCHER: I just don't know if you've made a call to each and every office, so...\nQUESTION: Good morning, Ari. I'm a little hesitant to ask this because of the source, but I need to it. There is a story making its way around the Internet of an alleged banquet the governor attended with more than 1,000 campaign volunteers to thank them. And the point of the story that's being circulated is that at this event Governor Bush took about a half hour out as he was greeting people to speak about religion with one 16-year-old at the event. Was there ever such an event?\nFLEISCHER: First, I've ever heard of this Internet--where, on the Internet, is this story from?\nQUESTION: E-mailed--well, it's e-mailed all over the place. It's attributed to a man named Dennis Lake (ph) of the Coalition of Churches Prison Ministry at Preston Wood Baptist (ph) in Plano, who tells the story of a man who has a friend who served on the campaign in Austin, and tells the story of last week Bush appeared at a thank you banquet for his staff and was going table to table to shake hands with 1,000-plus volunteers. He got to one lady, who, by a brief comment she made, indicated she was a Christian. She was with her 16-year-old son. Governor Bush asked him if he was a believer. He said he didn't think so.\nIt goes on to say that Bush said: \"Do you mind if I tell you how I came to know Christ as my Savior?\" The boy agreed. Governor Bush pulled up a chair and witnessed to him for 30 minutes, led him in the sinner's prayer and there were tears shed. I don't recall ever an event like this happening.\nWas there any kind of thank-you banquet for staffers?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I wasn't invited.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: There's a damn good reason for that.\nSPOKESMAN DAN BARTLETT: You all know his movements better than Ari and I usually do, and I don't recall any banquet with 1,000 campaign workers or volunteers.\nQUESTION: I got it, thanks.\nQUESTION: Just wanted to ask if you could enlarge a little bit upon the budget meeting. What's that going to be about? And in particular, do you anticipate preparations for any kind of regulatory announcement on January--well, whatever the first Monday is of the administration?\nFLEISCHER: On the budget meeting, it's a routine policy update. President-elect, throughout the course of the campaign, had a very similar approach where he would gather his top advisers on whatever the issue was, sit around a table, get a policy update, pepper them with questions, and that's how he leads.\nOn the regulatory announcements, we have not worked out the timetable, and we're still gathering--conducting the reviews of each and every one of the regulations. And what you can anticipate is, as our reviews of each of the last minute regulations, executive orders, are completed, decisions will be made by the president-elect. And I think that you can anticipate that's going to play itself out over a considerable period of time.\nAnd he begins office January 20. I would not suggest to you that you're going to see any instant reactions to any of these executive orders or regulations. They'll all be considered in a very thorough fashion, and then as policy staff presents its findings to the president-elect, he'll make his decisions. And, again, that will play out over time.\nQUESTION: OK, thank you.\nQUESTION: Good morning. I have a quick scheduling question and a Chavez question. On the Pentagon meetings, is there any particular topic area for the briefing? Is this going to be like missile defense or personnel issues, or just kind of courtesy call and broad overview of the various service sectors?\nFLEISCHER: It's going to be part courtesy call and a lot of real business. There's a lot of vital military information that is privileged to only the president of the United States, and that will be one of the purposes of the meeting.\nQUESTION: So like a world overview of what's going on with the military as opposed to any...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: Let me try to at 1:00 give you a little more specifics on it. Let me take that question and try to address it 1:00 with a little more specificity, beyond what I just said.\nQUESTION: And on Chavez, is it correct that you all were told that she was not aware that the woman was in the country illegally until after she left Chavez's home? And if so, is that the case? I mean, do you believe that is the case and do you stand by that?\nFLEISCHER: Yes. Let me address one part of that especially. If you read the front page of a couple of the nation's newspapers this morning, you'll see diametrically opposed information...\nQUESTION: Exactly, that's why I bring it up.\nFLEISCHER: ... to Tucker Eskew. And I just have to duly report that the version that says that she did not tell us that the person was illegal is erroneous.\nThe other version that says that she did acknowledge that the person was illegal is just a question of what timeframe that information came to her attention is in question. That report is correct.\nQUESTION: And what is the timeframe that is correct, after the woman left her house?\nFLEISCHER: Tucker is incomplete.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry?\nFLEISCHER: The other quote of Tucker in the version that says she did not know that...\nQUESTION: Right.\nFLEISCHER: ... incomplete quote, attributed to Tucker.\nQUESTION: But the timeframe is that she did not know until after the woman left her house?\nFLEISCHER: The timeframe of when she knew that Ms. Mercado was illegal is being reviewed.\nQUESTION: But did she tell you at some point that it was after the woman left her house? That's what I'm getting at.\nFLEISCHER: That's all being reviewed.\nQUESTION: So you now have some doubt about her assurance or her statement that she didn't know until after the woman left her house?\nFLEISCHER: We have received understandings that were given to Tucker, and we're just thoroughly reviewing it all.\nThe timeframe is just not clear of exactly when that information came to her attention.\nQUESTION: Yes, Ari, I was wondering if you had a timetable for the hearings for John Ashcroft?\nFLEISCHER: Let me see if I've got Ashcroft. He was not on my list for yesterday when he had a hearing. And my list is when the announcements are made by the Senate. The Senate has to announce it first before I can confirm it, of course. It's a Senate hearing. But my information yesterday did not include the Ashcroft hearing. and I have not gotten the updates this morning.\nQUESTION: All right. Thank you.\nQUESTION: I wonder, you said the vetting process continues. Have you learned anything new in the last 24 hours either from your own reviews or from news media accounts that you can report to us that changed the picture in any way?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, Scott, that's why I was trying to, you know, help everybody and just let you know what are process is. That's why I was referring to you how we've done our business during the campaign, the Florida recount and this as well. And that is we gather the information, along with the vetters, in as comprehensive and as thorough process as is possible.\nWe will await to have that process complete before we indicate to you what it is, if anything new, that we've learned. So once we have that complete, I'll have something to share. But until then, I'm going to be reticent to go further.\nQUESTION: Can you tell me what the vetting process or the investigation or the review, or the exploration involves right now? Is it FBI agents, other investigators? What exactly is the process?\nFLEISCHER: Well, it's the FBI full field investigation which is done for each nominee. As information is brought to the FBI's attention, they go out and they check it out. And so, they ask additional questions, they ask follow-ups, and conduct additional interviews. That's the process.\nQUESTION: So the FBI review is what you're awaiting?\nFLEISCHER: That's correct. Those are the vetters of Cabinet nominees. Those are the ones who conduct the full field investigation.\nQUESTION: Thanks very much.\nFLEISCHER: Thanks everybody, we'll see you at 1:00", "timestamp": "2001-01-09", "title": "Morning Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer, Spokesman for the President-Elect"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84898", "text": "[JOINED IN PROGRESS]\nBUSH: It was a great discussion. And I believe that there's a lot of common ground to be had to fulfill our obligations to make the world more peaceful. I talked loud and clear about a peaceful world really will depend upon our nation's willingness to make a concerted effort to keep the peace, our nation's effort to make sure that the men and women who wear our uniform are better paid and better housed and treated with the respect they deserve.\nI'm heartened by the discussion. Senator Warner, as being the oldest person here--well, as being one of the more senior...\n(LAUGHTER)\nMore senior, excuse me.\nSEN. JOHN WARNER (R-Va.): Well, I'm not so sure about the seniority, Mr. President-elect, but we thank you and Vice President-elect Cheney.\nWe've made history here today as we sit around this table--some of us have been here almost a quarter of a century on these committees--and this is the first time a president-elect has sat down with us ahead of the inauguration to hear our views.\nAnd defense has sort of been on the back burner, as one colleague said, for many years. Now we're put up at the round table with education and the economy and other weighty issues which you're considering.\nSo we thank you for this opportunity. And you've been a superb listener, together with our distinguished vice president-elect.\nWe have let them know very clearly, in a bipartisan way, what we perceive after these many years that we have served in this arena exactly what the posture is of the U.S. military today.\nWe've gone from Europe to the Pacific. We've gone from soldiers, sailors and airplanes to ships. We've covered it all as best we can in this very important meeting. And we express our appreciation to you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President-elect.\nBUSH: Mr. Levin--Mr. Chairman?\nSEN. CARL LEVIN (D-Mich.): Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect, for inviting us all. This is a very useful discussion. It's very helpful, I think, to have a dialogue as we've had and I really want to commend you and your team here, your strong team, for gathering us together and hearing from us.\nThe policy questions will hopefully be addressed on a bipartisan basis and this is surely a step towards that outcome. The committees and the representatives and the leadership that you have here have proven over time to be the building blocks for a bipartisan security policy. And we've been able to accomplish some really good improvements in our security because of the bipartisan support around this table and members of our appropriations and authorization committees.\nSo obviously, the real challenge is ahead to actually adopt policies which will have bipartisan support, but in order to really meet those challenges, you've taken an important step here today in having this dialogue and I want to thank you for it.\nBUSH: Anybody from the House? Mr. Chairman, do you want to say something?\nREP. FLOYD SPENCE (R-S.C.): I'd like to commend you something and that is for selecting the gentleman on your right as your vice president. He is the epitome of a statesman.\nBUSH: Well, as I said earlier...\n(LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: As I said earlier, I appreciate all those electoral votes he brought.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: Anybody from the Democrat side of the House want to say something?\nNorm?\nREP. NORMAN SISISKY (D-Va.): Mr. President, let me just say, we'll give you a lot of advice, we'll argue with you, but when it comes out, once you've made a decision, people in this room are going to support you on national defense.\nBUSH: Thank you, sir.\nWe'll be glad to take a few questions.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, you said earlier that you have confidence in Linda Chavez's qualifications to serve as labor secretary, but how does that providing shelter to a person who is in the country illegally square with your own call for stronger enforcement of immigration laws?\nBUSH: Tom, I haven't changed my mind, still got the same opinion that I had a couple of hours ago about Linda Chavez. I think she'll be a fine secretary of labor.\nQUESTION: You condone that kind of behavior, Mr. President-elect?\nBUSH: I still think she'll be--as I say, I haven't changed my mind from the first time you asked the question earlier this morning.\nYes?\nQUESTION: You didn't bring any information on that today.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, unfortunately it's the same subject, but...\nBUSH: Well, I haven't changed my opinion.\nQUESTION: I'd like to know, are you going to review to make sure you know all the facts? Is there any review process going on to make sure you know all the facts?\nBUSH: Absolutely, on all nominees. Any time new information comes up, we'll review all the facts on any nominee.\nAnd I expect our nominees to get good questioning in the Senate. That's what the hearings are all about. And I know there's going to be some withering questions for some of the people that we've nominated for the positions.\nBut I'm convinced all of them will be able to withstand the withering questions.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect...\nBUSH: Is that not the same question, hopefully...\nQUESTION: When did you learn about the circumstances of this?\nBUSH: Last night.\nQUESTION: And secondly, on the defense issue today: Do you plan to ask Congress for an increase--a big increase in defense spending this coming year? And how do you expect--how do you plan to sell the national missile defense issue to our allies?\nBUSH: Those series of questions--one, part of the discussions was here for Dick Cheney and Condi and me to hear the different priorities of the members of the Congress, where they thought we ought to spend money, where they thought we ought to focus our attention.\nWe'll be preparing--in the process of preparing a budget now. We're mindful of the different constraints on the budget.\nSecondly, the missile defense issue is an issue that we discussed, and it's a sensitive subject for some members. I understand that. It's a sensitive subject for leaders of different countries around the world.\nOn the other hand, I think it's our obligation to do everything we can to protect America and our allies from the real threats of the 21st century.\nBut the missile defense subject and the budgetary matters are all matters that require a lot of discussion and a lot of give and take and a lot of listening.\nAnd this was a good beginning.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, all of your nominees have been asked a very blunt question late in the interviewing process, namely, \"Is there anything in your past that would be an embarrassment if it became public?\"\nThe question is, was Mrs. Chavez asked that question? And what do you know her answer to have been?\nBUSH: I would have to ask the questioner. I haven't had a chance to ask the questioners the question they've been questioning. On the other hand, I firmly believe she'll be a fine secretary of labor. And I've got confidence in Linda Chavez.\nShe is a--she'll bring an interesting perspective to the Labor Department. First and foremost, she used to be a member of a labor union. Secondly, she was a staffer on the Hill for a Democrat committee. She's got a unique background. She's plenty capable and she's smart. She understands her job is to, for example, make sure that this economy as it roars forward--and hopefully it will--doesn't leave people behind, that there's work training programs that are effective to help people be able to work in the jobs of the 21st century.\nAnd I believe--strongly believe that when the Senate gives her a fair hearing, they'll vote for her.\nQUESTION: Second question, related to the latest proceedings. You talked a lot during the campaign about the importance of reinvigorating the military, but in contrast to some of your other proposals, there weren't a lot of dollar specifics.\nDid you get more specifics, in terms, today, in terms of costs for some of the things you want to do? And did you get feedback from...\nBUSH: Not yet. Not yet. One of the things that we were doing was listening. I am mindful that the executive branch gets to propose but the legislative branch gets to decide on matters such as budgets.\nSecondly, I said during the course of the campaign, we would like to see more pay, and our budget will reflect that.\nBut we also talked about the need for our secretary of defense to come to the Congress with a strategic vision; a vision that not only says, \"Here's how we maintain our force structure and make sure it's trained for the short run,\" but a vision that knows how best to deal with long-term issues.\nAnd today, you know, the discussion really did talk a lot about how best to utilize weapons systems that may be really relevant 20 years from now. And one member here was quite articulate on, for example, the B-2 and its relevance for the future.\nAnd it was just an interesting discussion that helps me and helps Dick and these will be--and the secretary of defense-designee will also be listening to members, obviously, not only during confirmation, but as he begins to prepare to recommend to us the strategic plan for what the military ought to look like.\nBecause first and foremost our job is to make sure that we have a plan and a vision, and then the budget will follow. And it's a plan and a vision that will actually reflect the threats that the country faces in the 21st century.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Good afternoon, Mr. President-elect.\nBUSH: No, the pleasure's mine.\nQUESTION: To the extent that there has been some criticism growing about some of your Cabinet selections, are you prepared to talk to some of the critics personally on their behalf? Would you take a phone call, invite phone calls from specific senators who have issues in order to advocate for those selections?\nBUSH: My first reaction is, I always anticipated that there would be some consternation about some of our nominees. I don't believe a Senate has ever said, \"Gosh, they're all wonderful.\" I think that's the role of the Senate, is to question and is to make sure that people that I've submitted to be Cabinet officials get a full hearing.\nSometimes the questioning can be a little tougher than we'd like, but surely the members that I picked will be able to answer those questions. I'm confident they will. And I expect there to be some tough questions, both from Democrats and from Republicans. And I think it's going to make our Cabinet members better Cabinet members.\nAs to whether or not I should pick up the phone and lobby, we'll just have to wait and see. I look forward to talking to the senators from both parties on a wide-ranging--you know, a whole bunch of different subjects, including my nominees, if need be.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Just one quick announcement before Gordon yanks us out of here.\nThere's already been a suggestion by some of the Senate colleagues here that perhaps you should offer a pardon to President Clinton after he leaves office. Can you give us an idea of your thinking and plans on that?\nBUSH: Well, I read that in the newspaper today. It's hard to pardon somebody who hadn't been indicted for anything.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Would you do it anyway, sir?\nBUSH: Well, no, I wouldn't pardon somebody who hasn't been indicted. I think the president--listen, here's my view: I think it's time to get all of this business behind us. I think it's time for the president--to allow the president to finish his term, and let him move on and enjoy life and become an active participant in the American system. And I think we've had enough focus on the past; it's time to move forward.\nBut the suggestion that I would pardon somebody who has never been indicted, that doesn't make any sense to me, frankly, in all due respect to the suggester, who I happen to like a lot. I spent quality time with him during the primaries.\nThank you all.", "timestamp": "2001-01-08", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84906", "text": "BARTLETT: As the schedule that we put out yesterday indicates, President-elect Bush will be participating in a meeting on defense issues with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders. That will start at 11:30 Central Standard Time. And then there will be a 1:30 p.m. Central Standard Time photo opportunity.\nUpon conclusion of that, we are preparing for participants of that meeting, similar to last week, to make themselves available to a larger press corps.\nQUESTION: Looking at what's going on with your nominee for labor secretary, you folks are telling us it was an act of compassion. Do you have anything that you can back that up with, other than just statements?\nFLEISCHER: Well, as you know, she has a history of taking people in. America has a long history of bringing people into your homes or other locations. This is something that the church community also often does. And it's typically looked on as a helpful hand and an act of compassion to help people who are in moments of need or in distress.\nAnd I think maybe we'll be able to work with you to get you some names of some people I know that are already publicly out there.\nQUESTION: OK. What can you tell us to disabuses of any notion that she, in fact, did employ her to some degree? I understand that there might be other people who availed themselves of Ms. Mercado's services to some degree or another about the same time.\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think that's what the whole vetting process is going through, is looking at. And we do know that she's had household help in the past, to whom she always paid their taxes. And all that information will, of course, will become part of the Senate record.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it's to the issue--apparently at the time that she was living with Ms. Chavez that she may have done work for other people, and I'm wondering if her relationship with Ms. Chavez was different than it was with other people for whom she did odd jobs?\nFLEISCHER: That will be all part of the clearing process and the Senate record. And I'm not going to try to weigh in on what items the Senate is going to thoroughly review. The facts will be developed before Senate, of course.\nQUESTION: All right. Thanks, but you can try to get us some more information to show her side of the story as the day goes on?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, I think Carter can help you with that.\nQUESTION: All right, very good. Thanks, Ari.\n. . .\nQUESTION: You seem to indicate you're still trying to learn more information about Ms. Chavez's relationship with the woman she hired. Is that correct? And what sorts of information are you looking for?\nAnd secondly, would the woman be available to testify before a Senate hearing?\nFLEISCHER: Well, on the second question, that's a matter you need to refer to the Senate. They are the ones, of course, who invite witnesses.\nOn the first part, you know, this is the normal vetting process that goes on for each and every nominee. There's a series of actions and steps that are part of the ongoing process, and, of course, we remain in the middle of it for Ms. Chavez and for all the nominees.\nAnd so, what you're seeing is the typical actions that are associated with confirmation process as you receive information for each one of them.\nQUESTION: And can you say what she's looking for, in terms of Ms. Chavez and the relationship with the woman who lived in her house?\nFLEISCHER: It's the usual, thorough approach that is taken as part of the Senate confirmation process to explore all issues that are part of the life of someone who may serve in the Cabinet.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n. . .\nQUESTION: . . . Back on this Chavez question. Ari, your answers indicate that the vetting process is sort of still going on and that the announcement of the nominees, in a sense, took place while their vetting is still in process. I guess my question is, you know, how much of the vetting was done before these people were named? And how much is held to go forward, while you prepare for their nomination--confirmation hearings?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, that's actually--it's old news. I announced that from the podium probably about 10 days ago, two weeks ago, how the process, of course, works.\nAnd, you know, each nominee sits down with clearing counsel. Each nominee fills out a gigantic stack of papers, and the papers are forwarded to the FBI, and the FBI begins the typical clearing process for each and every nominee.\nThe Senate, of course, undertakes its own review under its constitutional responsibilities. So you have a series of steps, and it's safe to say it concludes upon a vote of the United States Senate. That's the way it's always worked.\nQUESTION: So it's something like this issue with this woman who is living with Ms. Chavez. That's something that did not come up in the earlier vetting? Or was it just not expected to be a concern? Or is it just sort of a late surprise?\nFLEISCHER: Well, as you know, the vetting process is a private process between the nominee and our clearing counsel, and we're going to continue to honor that process.\nQUESTION: All right, thank you.\nQUESTION: A question about the trade representative. There's been some discussion of whether or not the USTR would be a Cabinet level position, and the current USTR, Charlene Barshefsky, said she thought that would be a very bad idea, that it would damage the U.S. prestige in terms of trade negotiations.\nMy question is: Does the president-elect intend to give the commerce secretary a greater role in negotiating trade deals? Or does he feel that the trade representative would do an adequate job even without Cabinet status?\nFLEISCHER: Oh, I think, for number one, as the president-elected indicated, that we have not made any decision about what the exact status will be for the USTR.\nAnd, two, as you know, he believes in building a Cabinet at all levels, and his top advisers at all levels, people who are very strong-willed and competent, capable of sitting around a table with a team of people. And he likes to get advice from strong people and from a variety of different positions. So I think you want to just withhold long enough and let's see who he designates as the USTR, and I think you'll have more information to evaluate it.\nQUESTION: One other thing, and it's a small thing on the advisory teams that you announced a few weeks ago. Several people have come forward and said, \"Oh, I'm on the advisory team as well,\" even though my name is not on the list. Have you added people to those lists? And will you put out a final list?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, when we put it out, we said this is a partial listing, and, of course, just the mere fact of publishing a partial listing inspired others to want to join, and so I think that's a reasonable request. We'll put it out. I think what we should probably do is put it out as it is final, as we have all names, so I'll take that question and see where we stand on it.\nQUESTION: OK, thanks.\nQUESTION: I was wondering if Ms. Chavez still has the full backing of the president-elect. And also, how does this case differ from the Zoe Baird case?\nFLEISCHER: Well, on the first question, nothing has changed since his initial announcement and since the things he said when he announced her.\nAnd I'm not certain that there are comparisons with the Zoe Baird case. That, of course, involved a different set of circumstances with different people.\nQUESTION: How is it a different circumstance?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I'm not fully aware of all the facts of Ms. Baird and who worked for her and what the facts were. But I think that will be an evaluation that the Senate will make. And we see no reason why the Senate will come to a conclusion that is identical to Zoe Baird's situation.\nQUESTION: So you still expect that she will be confirmed?\nFLEISCHER: Indeed. Indeed, indeed.\nQUESTION: Is the NASA administrator selection even on the transition team radar screen at this point?\nFLEISCHER: All those posts are on the radar. Any post that expires that needs to be filled is on the radar screen.\nThe presidential personnel operation here has actually grown to a pretty substantial number of people. We've got a developing team in place that's been--you know, it started out very small when we first arrived in McLean, and since that time, presidential personnel has really become a full-blown operation here.\nI had a meeting yesterday with somebody whose responsibility is to find people for boards and commissions.\nSo I think it's safe to assume that all levels of the government, we have people who are looking at them.\nI can't talk specifically about the NASA administrator--who they will be. But suffice it to say, we are moving to fill all jobs in the government that need to be filled.\nQUESTION: There's a report out this morning that you all will announce a NASA administrator pick today. Can you say thumbs up or thumbs down on that one?\nFLEISCHER: Well, as you know, I won't speculate about what we'll do or when we'll do it. But if you were looking at my thumb, you would see it's not in the up position.\nQUESTION: Thanks for that thumb forecast.\nOne final one: On domestic oil and gas production, President-elect Bush says he wants to see that boosted somehow. Does that mean he's rethinking his support for the moratorium on drilling off Florida's coast?\nFLEISCHER: I'm sorry. Say that question again.\nQUESTION: President-elect Bush has expressed a desire to boost domestic oil and gas production. During the campaign he announced his support for his brother's position in Florida: no offshore drilling off Florida's coast. Curious if that has changed now?\nFLEISCHER:No, he stands by his position.\nQUESTION: OK, thanks.\nQUESTION: I was wondering if you could confirm a story in American Banker today that says that the president-elect met on Friday with Don Powell (ph)?\nFLEISCHER: With Don Powell (ph)?\nQUESTION: Right. The story goes on to say that he intends to nominate him to head up the FDIC, you know. I wonder if you could talk about either components of the story.\nFLEISCHER: First, that's news to me. But second of all, as you know, we don't confirm who we did or did not meet with. Can't confirm that.\nQUESTION: Ari, could you clarify what the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that Mr. Bush has told executives he might create a high-level czar to promote the tech industry's agenda inside the White House? That is somewhat contradictory from your own statement that there would be a person at OMB.\nFLEISCHER: Dan, do you have anything on that?\nBARTLETT: Well, the term czar was never introduced at the meeting. President-elect Bush spoke with the high-tech leaders regarding, you know, his willingness to have a strong relationship. He had spoken during the campaign about having representation in the high-tech community.\nAnd I think what Ari was indicating was, during the campaign we talked about that being in OMB.\nHe has not ruled out any other additional selection of a person, but the word \"czar\" has been introduced by other people, not by the president-elect or his staff.\nQUESTION: Well, would it be accurate to say that you might have more than one person overseeing technology issues?\nBARTLETT: Possibly.\nQUESTION: And when would you make that decision?\nBARTLETT: When he makes that determination.\nQUESTION: And would the OMB post be a confirmable position?\nBARTLETT: I'm not sure on that.\nQUESTION: OK.\nBARTLETT: Ari, do you know? Is that...\nFLEISCHER: No, I don't know how far Senate confirmation extends in the Office of Management and Budget.\nQUESTION: And do you expect to see any more money for technology?\nFLEISCHER: That's an existing position at OMB?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nFLEISCHER: And what the president-elect said is that he's going to give that person in addition to their regular duties another distinct duty involving technology.\nThe additional duty doesn't change whether that person is Senate-confirmable or not. You may just need to take a look at the existing structure of OMB.\nThe Senate Budget Committee is responsible for OMB confirmation. So they may be in a position to get you the best answer fastest.\nQUESTION: And one final question, will we see many changes in the IT structure within government, in terms of how much money is spent and the direction it's taking?\nFLEISCHER: I would refer you to his campaign statements about technology. And there's nothing more I can add to that.\nQUESTION: About Linda Chavez, also: Even if she didn't give this money to the employee, the fact that she kept her two years in her home and she leave three months afterwards and she didn't have the papers, is not that a violation of the immigration laws?\nFLEISCHER: I think America has a long history of applauding compassion and helping people. And I think any other information that people are bringing forward is part of the vetting process and I'd leave it at that.", "timestamp": "2001-01-08", "title": "Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer, Spokesman for the President-Elect"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84907", "text": "FLEISCHER: Good afternoon.\nI have a series of announcements I want to share with you, and we'll take questions.\nLots of personnel news today. A paper will be circulating in just a moment.\nPresident-elect Bush today is announcing his intention to name the following people to White House staff positions: Brad Blakeman (ph) as deputy assistant to the president for appointments and scheduling; Hector Storza (ph) as deputy assistant to the president for management and administration; Scott McClellan as deputy assistant to the president and deputy press secretary; and Brian Montgomery (ph) as deputy assistant to the president and director of advance.\nThere's a paper will be circulating. We have it here now with the correct spelling on everybody. Incoming First Lady Barbara Bush--Laura Bush has the following announcements to make.\n(LAUGHTER)\nFLEISCHER: Let's start that over.\n... following announcements to make: Andy Ball (ph) will be chief of staff to the first lady; Kathryn Fenton (ph) will be the White House social secretary; Noella Rodriguez (ph), press secretary to the first lady; Ann Hylandgeistein (ph) as director of projects to the first lady; Desirea Thompson-Sayle (ph) as director of correspondence to the first lady; and Quincy Hicks (ph) as director of scheduling and advance for the first lady.\nThe final announcement deals with hearing schedules up on the Hill, and these are the following hearing schedules as best I have them that are already publicly announced by the Senate. I just offer this to you for your convenience so you have the information in one location.\nSecretary-designate Paige will have his hearing on January 10; Secretary-designate Rumsfeld, January 11; General Powell, January 16; Governor Whitman, January 16; Secretary-designate Abraham, January 18; and Secretary-designate Norton also on January 18.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to take your questions.\nQUESTION: Do you have a copy of the tape made in the Oval Office when Mr. Nixon was talking to Mr. Rumsfeld about Vice President Agnew's trip to Africa?\nFLEISCHER: I've listened to that tape. I have a cassette version of it. And as I say, I've listened to it.\nQUESTION: May we have a copy? Or may we hear it?\nFLEISCHER: I don't see why not. I don't think there's any issue there. I have it on one of those boom boxes, literally, and the audio quality is not very good, but I'm more than happy to play it for you.\nQUESTION: I'd love to get a copy, if you could.\nFLEISCHER: To get a copy, I would refer you to the National Archives. I mean, we're not in the business here of making cassette tapes. I don't think we even have the capacity to do that here, frankly.\nQUESTION: Well, we can manage.\nFLEISCHER: Well, I'm more than happy to let you hear it.\nQUESTION: Ari, when did you first learn that Chavez hired an illegal immigrant? And were you surprised by this revelation?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think that, first, the vetting process, as I discussed this morning, for each and every one of our nominees begins with a clearing counsel meeting with each nominee. And then the FBI throughout this entire course conducts its background investigation as has been traditional and typical. And then of course the United States Senate has its own investigation that they do.\nAnd so, all of these are pieces of the ongoing vetting process and background process and you continue to learn throughout each one of these phases of the process. And the information that was shared with us in the vetting meeting, of course I'm not going to get into, that's a private conversation between the clearing counsel and each nominee.\nQUESTION: Well, was the president-elect satisfied with the information that the nominee gave to him, that she was fully forthcoming?\nFLEISCHER: The president-elect announced her, of course, as his designee, which is an indication of the fact that he was satisfied and he announced her.\nHe knew all the--any information that he needed to be shared with the vetting council would be brought to the president-elect's attention if there was anything that he needed to know prior to an announcement.\nQUESTION: But specifically about Linda Chavez and Marta Mercado, did he know about that at that time?\nFLEISCHER: Obviously, he announced her.\nAnd again, I'm not going to want to get into the details of everything that is in that process. But suffice it to say, there's a lot of questions that are raised and answered in the course of those meetings.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) the inference that he didn't know by the way you're answering or not answering the...\nFLEISCHER: Well, let me try to be more helpful.\nDuring the course of those meetings, one question that, you know, you can assume gets asked is about household help and whether you've had household help. If so, have you paid all the income taxes for that household employee?\nWe, of course, do not ask each and every one of our nominees to list all the many acts of compassion that they may have carried out on behalf of people. That is not the type of issue or question that would rise up to the level where it becomes an important part or any part of the interview process.\nSo I think you can assume it was safe to say that the question about household employees and paying taxes was asked. And acts of compassion, we don't ask our designees to delineate each and every one of them.\nQUESTION: Did you ask if they harbored illegal immigrants in their house?\nFLEISCHER: There's a whole series of questions that are asked about matters that can in any way need to be brought to the attention of the president. And, as I indicated, the process is ongoing.\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: I'm not going to go down each and every question.\nQUESTION: Did Ms. Chavez know that she was harboring--that this woman was in the country illegally?\nFLEISCHER: I think that you've seen in the press this morning that she has acknowledged that she knew the legal status of the person. The exact date of that has not been determined, at which point she actually did know that information. And that is all part of the ongoing process.\nQUESTION: Ari, are you--is the president-elect at this moment satisfied that Ms. Chavez did nothing illegal related to this?\nFLEISCHER: I think you--the president-elect spoke on that topic about half of an hour ago.\nQUESTION: He didn't answer that specific question, though. Does it bother the president-elect that she may have committed an act of questionable legality?\nFLEISCHER: The president-elect now remains confident in his nominee and in the fact that we believe, as we do with all of our nominees, that she'll be confirmed.\nQUESTION: She was illegal at that time, but then she became legal. And there is some sort of an amnesty that sets in. So where does that leave the situation now?\nFLEISCHER: Well, these are all so precise legal matters, and that's why the normal vetting process continues. I mean, the definitions are precise ones, and the process is a careful and a thorough one. And we're confident that the process is being handled properly and fully.\nAnd the president-elect remains confident in his choice. She's an excellent choice to be secretary of labor, and she'll make a great secretary of labor.\nQUESTION: What happens to a nominee whose had just a casual worker, maybe a gardener or somebody, and didn't check on the status? I mean, is it fair to lose a nomination because of this?\nFLEISCHER: Well, you know, ultimately, this is something, again, that our nation has a long history of people engaging in acts of compassion and helping out people in times of trouble or in moments of need. And that's important. And that is part of, I think, what has happened here, a significant part. And, again, that's one of the reasons the president-elect maintains that confidence, just as he indicated. He talked about this just a little while ago himself.\nQUESTION: Mr. Fleischer, acts of compassion and harboring a person who's in the country illegally, isn't it something stronger than--isn't there a suggestion of illegality there? Or something improper about that?\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, I would urge you--well, you used the word \"harbor,\" I'm not certain that's at all accurate, to say \"harbored.\" That may very well not be the case at all. So I just urge you to be careful on that word, that's a specific word, that word has illegal meaning.\nQUESTION: But you're calling it an \"act of compassion,\" and...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: I think there is no doubt about it. Taking somebody who is in a moment of need into your home is an act of compassion. She's done this on many occasions with other people of various backgrounds and from various walks of life. It's called kindness.\nQUESTION: Other people who were in the country illegally?\nFLEISCHER: I don't have any information on that.\nQUESTION: What precisely was the need? In what way was this woman in need?\nFLEISCHER: I don't know all the individual facts about this person who was in need, and what her specific needs were. I think some of them are probably a little bit sensitive as well, and so I don't want to delineate. But I think it's fair to say that she was down on her luck and she was going through some difficult times, and she reached out.\nAnd as is the tradition of our country, Linda Chavez reached back and helped her.\nQUESTION: Where did they meet? Do you know, Ari, where they met?\nFLEISCHER: No.\nQUESTION: Ari, does performing an act of compassion, at any point, justify breaking the law?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I wouldn't urge you--I'm not sure where you get that second part of the question from. I'm not going to speculate about things like that.\nQUESTION: I mean as a general question.\nFLEISCHER: No, I'm not going to go down that road. I think, that you're asking me specifically about this matter, and there's no evidence of that.\nQUESTION: No evidence that any laws were broken, is that correct?\nFLEISCHER: I think we're going to let the process continue.\nAre you bringing something to my attention?\nQUESTION: I'm asking you if you have evidence that laws were broken and if an act of compassion would justify that?\nFLEISCHER: Obviously, we do not have such evidence at this time, and I'm not certain that--we do not.\nQUESTION: Concerning Ms. Chavez's (OFF-MIKE) aren't you worried about the hypocrisy factor here?\nFLEISCHER: Well, you said hired. I'm not aware that anyone was hired in this case.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nFLEISCHER: Well, but that's totally different. It's not the same as a hiring.\nQUESTION: What's the legal definition of hiring?\nFLEISCHER: Hiring is an employee. Hiring is a classification as an employee, as opposed to taking somebody in a moment of need into your home.\nQUESTION: Sir, how do you square the active compassion of protecting or helping an illegal immigrant with the president-elect's assurance that the immigration laws in the nation should be fully enforced?\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, the process is continuing forward. All the questions are being asked and answered, and if anything else comes to light, we'll talk about it at that time, if that happens.\nQUESTION: Just one more question. How did she get to the United States, do you know, and whether she was a refugee from the war down there?\nFLEISCHER: I do not know.\nQUESTION: Is having a clean legal record a requirement for a Cabinet appointment in the Bush administration? Or is that something that you guys have addressed or have fears that...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, I think you're going back to the question of legality and what is legal. And as I mentioned, again, that the president-elect has a vetting process that is ongoing, that began with a clearing council, and the process continues.\nAnd so, obviously, we take a look at everything. We look at all specific matters, and we look at things in terms of the context of them as well, and the president-elect make his determinations.\nQUESTION: Ari, what is the administration's view, the incoming administration's view, the president-elect's view, of the legal responsibility of a citizen, an American citizen, who is involved with a person, perhaps helping them out, sheltering them in a time of need, and at a certain point, discovers that they're in the country illegally? What is the citizen's proper responsibility in that set of circumstances?\nFLEISCHER: Well, again, I'm not going to answer that question because it's all in the context of one specific case, and those facts are all being ascertained. And so I think--it's too specific to that case.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: ... all of that seems to be clearly established. What is a citizen's responsibility, whether it's Linda Chavez or anyone else's? What is their legal responsibility in the view of the president-elect?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I don't think that we're in the business of telling every citizen what their legal responsibilities are. Their responsibilities are clearly to comport with the law, and that's important, and that's ongoing.\nQUESTION: What does the law require?\nFLEISCHER: I think that all depends on the facts of the case.\nQUESTION: Does it not require that citizen to do something, to take...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: Again, I think it all depends on the facts of the case.\nQUESTION: Your answer a moment ago suggested that the fact-gathering process in this case is still under way. And I had the earlier impression that you had satisfied yourselves?\nFLEISCHER: Well, the fact-gathering process is under way with each and every nominee, from the moment that they are announced by the president-elect until the moment that they are confirmed by the Senate.\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: That's part and parcel of the clearing process, of the nomination process, of the vetting process. As I indicated, the vetting process is several factors, each of which is conducted at a different point of time, beginning with the clearing council interview, and then with the FBI full field investigation, with the Senate's investigation that they conduct as an independent branch of the government.\nAll of that is part and parcel of the background investigation that obviously, when you investigate the background, you're gathering facts.\nQUESTION: Sir, but I took it mean that you were referring specifically to this case, of this undocumented alien.\nFLEISCHER: No, that applies to everything, involving every piece of anybody's background in all Cabinet matters and all Cabinet appointees.\nQUESTION: Are you satisfied that you have all of the facts in this particular case relating to the undocumented alien?\nFLEISCHER: That's why it's an ongoing vetting process.\nQUESTION: In other words, you're not.\nFLEISCHER: It's an ongoing vetting process, of course.\nQUESTION: Have you figured out yet how much money, exactly, Linda Chavez paid this woman? And do you consider that part of the act of kindness and not compensation for the chores that she did around the house?\nFLEISCHER: I think that's all matters that will be brought to the Senate's attention.\nQUESTION: But have you made that determination? Or are those facts still being gathered?\nYes, you know the specific facts of it--that again is part of the background investigation. And not every piece of the background investigation is going to get shared. Not at least--you know, that's the Senate's purview.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Am I correct in my impression that the president-elect will not hesitate to speak out against any instance of racial discrimination in the United States government?\nFLEISCHER: I would concur.\nQUESTION: The House Democrat caucus expelled Congressman Traficant of Ohio and took away his committee assignments because he voted for the reelection of the speaker of the House. But they have done not one thing to the Black Caucus members who, as Mr. Gore noted, illegally on Saturday disrupted the joint congressional session for 20 minutes.\nAnd my question is: Why is this punishment of Traficant, who is white, and no punishment for blacks not racial discrimination?\nFLEISCHER: Well, obviously, on all matters of committee assignments, that's a matter of the legislative branch to decide. And I think the executive in all areas will not do well to weigh in on congressional committee assignments.\nQUESTION: Well, he doesn't think that that's right, does he?\nFLEISCHER: Again, I think...\nQUESTION: You don't think it's right, do you, Ari? You were up there on the Hill.\nFLEISCHER: I know when I worked on the Hill, the president didn't typically weigh in on committee assignments. And President-elect Bush is not going to weigh in on committee assignments.\nQUESTION: Ari, there's been a lot of crowing in the European press over the fact that the measures by Greenspan to lower the interest rates led to a one-day, you know, up in the stock market, and then it started going down again. Is the president-elect concerned that the economic situation he'll be facing is perhaps much more serious than has been indicated and that maybe even his $1 trillion tax cut would not be enough to deal with the problem?\nFLEISCHER: Our concerns about the economy are ongoing and enduring. There's new information this morning from several Wall Street economists where they believe that growth is going to be far less than previously projected. In fact, some well-known economists are now predicting negative growth.\nAnd so it is a matter that we brought up several months ago, accurately so at the time. Some people criticized us for bringing up information that needed to be discussed and shared with the American people. And we're going to continue to keep a close eye on it. And that's one of the reasons the president-elect feels so strongly that we need to pass into law his economic recovery plan. And it's another reason we need to have a comprehensive national energy policy to protect America from any energy disruptions as well.\nYes?\nQUESTION: The President-elect has made an invitation to the former president of Argentina, Menem, to be here for the inaugural parties. Has he know that DEA is doing an investigation on the former president and his involvement in narco-trafficking?\nFLEISCHER: Let me take that question and try to get back on it.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Yesterday, Senator Orrin Hatch said he would pardon President Clinton if he were indicted. I know President Clinton has said that he does not such a pardon. But what would President-elect Bush do if faced with such an issue?\nFLEISCHER: The president-elect's position, as expressed during the campaign, was that president-elect--or President Bush has neither sought nor asked for a--President Clinton--President-elect Bush's position, during the campaign, was that President Clinton has neither asked for nor sought a pardon, and he takes President Clinton at his word.\nQUESTION: Following-up on that, Ari, presuming that the president-elect is fully aware and fully intends to follow the Constitution, Section 3, Article II, \"He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" how could he possibly think of pardoning his predecessor, who not only took no such care, but also broke the laws against perjury and obstruction of justice?\nAnd since the Federal Bureau of Prisons would not answer my question as to how many prisoners are serving time for perjury, but there must be some, my question is, if President-elect Bush were to pardon President Clinton, as Hatch and Hyde have both suggested, what about the Supreme Court's building promise of equal justice under law?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I think I've already addressed that question. The president has neither asked for nor sought a pardon, and we take him at his word.\nQUESTION: So he has no intention, at this point, of giving any such pardon, does he, Ari?\nFLEISCHER: I think I've answered the question.\nQUESTION: President-elect Bush is coming to Washington, can you tell us a little bit about what he's going to do while he's here?\nFLEISCHER: He will get here tomorrow night. Get's into Andrews, I believe 7:30ish, remain overnight at the Blair House.\nWednesday morning he will go--I believe the first stop is the Pentagon. He has Pentagon briefings on Wednesday. I did not bring down the complete schedule with me. Wednesday is Pentagon. He'll do some personnel events late in the day.\nHe will also have his official portrait taken--his photograph taken--which will hang in all the nation's post offices and federal buildings.\nAnd then on Thursday, he will have some CIA briefings and he will also have the educational forum that I talked about last week. That's going to be a group of educational entrepreneurs who are going to be gathering, a diverse group of people, to give the president-elect their ideas and thoughts about improving education in America.\nHe'll, of course, also, push for his comprehensive education reform package and try to build support for it so we can move quickly upon his swearing in to pass that on the Hill.\nAnd then he departs back to Texas Thursday mid-afternoon.\nQUESTION: When he gets back, how active do you expect that stretch to be between, you know, when he gets back and then returns to Washington for the inauguration? Does he have much left on his...\nFLEISCHER: Depends on how well his packing is going.\nQUESTION: From what we see, what could we expect?\nFLEISCHER: I don't have a rundown on the schedule much beyond that. I know I've been asked before what's the exact date he's coming up to Washington. There still is a little flexibility in that and so once that's settled, I'll have a report on that.\nQUESTION: Some sort of policy summits, meetings with congressional leaders--is there much of that left to do before he comes to...\n(CROSSTALK)\nFLEISCHER: There could be. I just don't have a hard read on that yet.\nQUESTION: When you say personnel events on Wednesday, do you mean announcements? He'll make personnel announcements?\nFLEISCHER: I think he's going to have some continued meetings--you know, more meetings with people, and that, of course, means there could be announcements, but there's nothing to report yet. But he will be meeting with additional people for potential jobs.\nQUESTION: Is this the first time he's staying at the Blair House? That's pretty significant.\nFLEISCHER: Unless it was--as president-elect, yes, it is, as president-elect.\nQUESTION: He'll stay both nights at the Blair House, not just Wednesday, right?\nFLEISCHER: Well, I was told Tuesday night. I would hardly imagine that you'd pack your bags and go to another place the next night unless you don't like your accommodations. I don't think that's ever been the case with the Blair House. Unless there's some new information, yes, I think he's going to be at the Blair House for all nights.\nQUESTION: It conveys head of state status on him, in a sense.\nFLEISCHER: I'm not certain about that if that's the protocol of the Blair House. I'm not certain what their protocol is.\nQUESTION: What are the first 100 days going to look like? Is there going to be an aggressive campaign to get some things passed through Congress?\nFLEISCHER: We're going to have more to say on that in short order. But, you know, there's a notion of 100 days. I think when you talk to most scholars now, they seem to think that the real window to measure a presidency is really 180 days.\nAnd I can tell you from our initial planning, from the things that we are working on and the time table, we expect to move forward with legislation that could potentially get enacted into law, 180 days is a much more proper window to measure. And I think the scholars have good reason for saying that. If you look back, 100 days is really, in the course of a presidency--you know, the Congress doesn't even pass a budget resolution until April 15 by statute, and typically it's even later than April 15. That's the exception.\nSo I think that we're going to be looking at maybe a different window. And that's a time to sum up and judge what your priorities are, the order in which you move on legislation, and of course then you start getting measured in terms of your successes or your failures on the Hill.\nI think you may want to take a look at the window, the timing of it. But we'll have more to say on that.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) for the CIA briefings?\nFLEISCHER: We'll have the exact schedule out. I think we're going to try to get that out either today or tomorrow. And it'll all be on there.\nQUESTION: Any press events or any (OFF-MIKE) during the trip here?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, there will be. Of course, the education meeting is open to the press in its entirety. And that will be Thursday morning.\nThe last I saw that's going to be relatively early on Thursday morning. It could begin as soon as 8:30 which means much worse set-up times, of course.\nQUESTION: Why is the education meeting open and the economic forum last week was not open? Is there a reason behind that?\nFLEISCHER: I think at the economic forum he wanted to--really at a time of greater sensitivity in terms of what people are thinking about, the performance of the economy. He thought that the best meeting would be a meeting where people could engage in a little more frank fashion.\nI don't think there's any such particularly market movement sensitivities about an education meeting. And so we've decided to make that education meeting open.\nAnd I think what you're always going to see on these type of meetings is we're going to strive for a healthy mix. There are always going to be times when the president-elect would make the determination that he wants to have a portion of the meeting open, but he wants to be able to get that free and frank exchange that I think everybody recognizes doesn't always when there's live TV coverage, for example.\nAt other times, however, we're going to have meetings and we're going to try to endeavor to keep everything open when we do. So the education meeting will be open.\nQUESTION: Ari, in this new window for action, we will see the president of the United States asking for fast track in Congress?\nFLEISCHER: Indeed, that is one of the president's priorities. We do believe that to protect the economy and to help other nations to develop and to grow, and for their economies to be strong in an interactive world, fast track negotiating authority is a crucial piece of the president's economic agenda. And the president-elect did commit during the campaign to seeking early passage of fast track. And that is an important presidential priority.\nQUESTION: Could you be more precise about when you may start with that?\nFLEISCHER: The exact time? No, I cannot say yet.\nQUESTION: But it's safe to say the first six months of this year?\nFLEISCHER: I'm not going to put an arbitrary date on it, but when we have it, we'll get it out. But suffice it to say that is an important presidential priority.\nQUESTION: What's your assessment of the likelihood of passage of fast track, given the problems President Clinton had?\nFLEISCHER: You know, I think it's probably too soon to say. I haven't really taken a look at the new members of Congress to see whether that's a group that's particularly supportive of free trade or not. Obviously, every time you have a new makeup of the Congress, you take a look at that. There are clearly a group of Democrats, Congressman Bob Matsui of California, who has been a prominent leader of fast track and who has helped put together Democrat coalitions for fast track.\nBut the environment for free trade has gotten tougher in recent years. If you recall, during the primaries, President-elect Bush was criticized from the right for his stance on the importance of free trade. And he believes in it and he believes in it strongly. And he'll take on various coalitions whether they are in his own party or in other parties to get the job done. He believes in it.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nFLEISCHER: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION:\nFLEISCHER: Well, the Republican Party has always been behind fast track. When you take a look at the way the votes broke down on the Hill, the Republican Party supported it. In fact, I believe in 1998 when it was voted on, and it was defeated--I may be wrong on the year, it could have been '99--the Republicans broke by a overwhelming majority, it was either 2-to-1 or 4-to-1 for fast track.\nThe Democrats overwhelmingly voted against it, but there was a good block of Democrats who were for it. Now, the exact numbers, that remains to be seen.\nQUESTION: Ari, on free trade, the government of Chile has already rejected the idea to have a free trade with the United States in the same frame that the United States has with Jordan. Has the president-elect take a look to his ideas for this free trade agreement with Chile?\nFLEISCHER: I'm going to hesitate to comment on the specific substance of various free trade agreements that are being negotiated right now. That would fall under the category of: until January 20.\nQUESTION: Does the president-elect plan to enforce the Supreme Court's Beck decision, as President Clinton apparently refused to do? How do you feel on that, Ari?\nFLEISCHER: Yes, the president does believe in paycheck protection. That was part of his campaign finance reform proposals, in regards specifically to Beck and the legal mechanisms of the regulatory process.\nI have not heard the president-elect discuss that during the course of the campaign. But suffice it to say, he does believe that it's important that people can participate in a political process and give money, but that should be voluntary, it should not be involuntary.\nAnd so, if somebody has money taken from them without their permission, and it is used for political purposes, with which they may not disagree, he believed that's not fair. And he thinks that's true, whether it applies to corporations or whether it applies to unions.\nInvoluntarily taking money from somebody or somebody having involuntarily their money taken for a cause in which they don't believe, he thinks that's wrong.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Back on the economy, how seriously is the president-elect looking at front-loading the tax cuts for some sort of stimulus package to increase economic growth?\nFLEISCHER: Well, he's looking at it. That is a concern. And, again, I think you're going to want to take a look at the economic data as it continues to pour in, and to see how urgent the need may or may not become, but it is an option and it is under review.\nQUESTION: Can you give us an update on the inaugural speech? Is it in his hands yet? Do you have any sense of themes?\nFLEISCHER: I have not had a good enough conversation with that to give you an update on the themes. I know that it's on his mind, and I know that drafts are being worked on, but I don't have anything more than that yet. Let me take that and try to get back. I'll probably take that and come back at the podium with that. I think that's important.\nQUESTION: Couple of questions on Ashcroft. People are charging that he is an arch-conservative is trying to force his agenda or is going to be forcing his agenda on the Justice Department. What do you have to say about that? And then, also charges of racism, as well?\nFLEISCHER: Right. As for the agenda, the agenda of Attorney General Ashcroft, if he is confirmed by the Senate, is the agenda of all members of the Cabinet if they're voted on favorably by the Senate, will be president-elect Bush's agenda.\nAnd it is the duty of each and every member of the Cabinet to fully enforce the current laws as they are on the books.\nTheir agenda, though, will be President-elect Bush's, what he ran on during the course of the campaign. And certainly, when it comes to justice, what you hope to see, and this is why President-elect Bush named John Ashcroft, is someone who will enforce the law and will do so impartially and will do so with integrity and I think that's terribly important. I think that's a signal that the American people want to know comes from the top of Justice and the American people will take great pride in knowing that John Ashcroft can do that.\nThe second part of your question?\nQUESTION: Racism. Integrity is used so much when to describe him, but there are still charges of racism out there.\nFLEISCHER: Well, I understand that this is Washington and people, for varieties of reasons, will allege things that just are not true and are the worst, and it's part of why the nomination process needs to be a thoughtful and a reasoned process. And for any other groups that, again, were reported last week that are using this as a way for them to raise money or as they, themselves, said to prepare for the next battle, that's just wrong. That does not contribute to the thoughtful process that we need. That contributes and is one more reason why we need to change the tone in Washington.\nBut certainly a man who voted for 26 of the 28 judicial nominations that came before him in the United States Senate who were African-American, obviously there are substantive reasons that apply to people from every race and walk of life. And John Ashcroft has a very powerful, strong record on the question of civil rights, and signed the Martin Luther King bill into law as a governor of his state, and we're very proud of that.\nQUESTION: Ari, on fast track, it's very--been, in the past, a very divisive issue. Is there a concern that that could detract from the president-elect's efforts to be a uniter in Washington?\nFLEISCHER: Well, fast track is a divisive issue. Fast track is an important issue. And the president-elect has principles that he's going to fight for. And one of those is the importance of free trade. And that of course--the issue of free trade--is an issue where people on both parties have strong passions.\nIt creates unusual alliances. And we're going to--President-elect Bush is going to be proud to put together an alliance that's going to involve a host of Democrats, because you cannot pass fast track without Democratic support, just as President Clinton relied very heavily on Republicans across the aisle to pass--to try to pass fast track and just as President Clinton relied overwhelmingly on Republicans to get NAFTA passed and enacted into law.\nIt requires bipartisan coalitions. And that's the essence of government. And it'll be a test of many people to see whether they're going to join this bipartisan coalition.\nQUESTION: Ari, one of the most difficult issues within fast track has been whether or not to include labor or environmental standards as part of trade agreements. Would President-elect Bush, in order to unite people around the issue, drop that? Or would he try to accommodate Democrats? Can you give us any preview about how he'd handle that?\nFLEISCHER: Again, his focus is going to be on passing trade agreements that are in the interest of our country, that help other nations to trade with us, and that help us to trade with those other nations.\nThose issues that are most influential in the securing of fast track agreements that are bilateral, that can be supported--or multilateral--deal with the economy.\nQUESTION: Ari, on the president-elect's energy program, is he looking again at nuclear energy? Where there has been a crisis in a lot of countries, now they're revising their attitude towards nuclear energy. Will he also do that or take a serious look at going back to nuclear in some instances?\nFLEISCHER: On the question of nuclear, if you take a look at the comprehensive energy speech he gave in Michigan in September, there was a portion in there on nuclear. I would refer you to that.\nQUESTION: Ari, is the president-elect still looking for a second and maybe a third Democrat to fill senior administration posts?\nFLEISCHER: He's continuing to look for the best, and I don't think it's going to matter what their party is, so long as they support his agenda. And I don't rule anything in. Obviously, I'm not going to rule it out. So we'll just see what other additional appointments he makes and what party they come from.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2001-01-08", "title": "Afternoon Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer, Spokesman for the President-Elect"}

Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84892", "text": "BUSH: Good morning.\nToday I had the honor of naming two of my close friends and associates to high level positions in my administration. During the course of the campaign much was made of the so-called \"Texas Iron Triangle.\" Previously, I named one of the legs of the triangle to a White House position, and that was Karen Hughes.\nToday, it is my honor to report to the nation that the remainder of the \"triangle\" has agreed to serve in my administration. First, Joe Allbaugh: Joe has been a loyal, strong friend who has agreed to become the director of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nFEMA is an incredibly important part of a president's team. The person who runs FEMA is someone who must have the trust of the president, because the person who runs FEMA really is the first voice often times that someone whose lives have been turned upside down hears from.\nI can't think of a better man to take the job than Joe Allbaugh. He's a well-organized individual. He cares a lot about his fellow man. He has been by my side during the natural disasters that took place, over the last six years. He's seen what an effective agency can mean to people, and I'm really pleased that Joe has agreed to take on the assignment. He's going to do a fabulous job.\nSecondly, Karl Rove has agreed to serve as the senior adviser and assistant to the president. Karl has got a fantastic mind. He is one of the reasons why I was elected governor, and one of the reasons why I was elected the president. He comes to Washington with a wonderful sense of history, a great understanding of the presidency as an institution in America. He will bring good judgment, good humor and good advice to the White House.\nAnd so it's a wonderful pleasure to announce the \"triangle\" has been completed, and that these two good men and their families will be joining us in Washington, D.C.\nAnd I'd like to ask Joe Allbaugh to say a few remarks.\nALLBAUGH: Mr. President-elect, thank you so much.\nI am humbled by your nomination. I am touched by your confidence. I'm excited about being at FEMA. I can't think of a better place to help out fellow countrymen when they are in time of need. I look forward to joining the thousands of reservists, employees and volunteers that will continue in American tradition of assisting our American citizens when disaster strikes.\nAnd lastly, I'd like to thank my family, for without their love and consideration, I would be incomplete.\nThank you, Mr. President-elect.\nBUSH: Mr. Rove?\nROVE: Thank you, Mr. President (sic). I'm honored by your call to service, and I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be a lifetime very rewarded. Thank you, sir; appreciate it.\nBUSH: Thank you all; we'll see you at the lunch hour.", "timestamp": "2001-01-04", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect Announcing the Nomination of Joe Allbaugh as Director of FEMA and the Appointment of Carl Rove as Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84895", "text": "PRESIDENT-ELECT BUSH: Before I have a few comments about what Mr. Greenspan did today, I do want to announce that Larry Lindsey will be an assistant to the president for economic affairs. I look forward to Larry's advice and counsel. I'm so honored he's agreed to join the White House. He'll be a fine addition.\nSecondly, I am pleased that the Fed has cut the interest rates. I think the cut was needed. It was a strong statement that measures must be taken to make sure our economy does not go into a tailspin.\nOne of the messages Mr. Greenspan sent was that we need bold action, not only at the Fed, but I would interpret that to mean bold action in the halls of Congress to make sure this economy stays vibrant.\nAnd to that end, I think it's really important for members of the Congress to understand that the tax relief plan I've put forth is an integral part of economic recovery.\nI say recovery because a lot of folks in this room brought some pretty bad news: that their sales are slowing, that they're having to trim back their work force. It's going to be important for the president to work with the Congress to do what's right to make sure that our economy grows. And tax relief, meaningful, fair tax relief will be a stimulus.\nWe need to make sure our nation is a nation of free trade and less regulation. We've got to make sure that our society where lawsuits don't drive capital out of the private sector, capital so needed to make sure the people can find work.\nAnd so, one of the common themes here in this meeting was, was that in order to make sure Americans can find work that we've got to be mindful of the warning signs.\nAnd today, Alan Greenspan was mindful of the warning signs by taking a bold step. When I get sworn in as president, I intend to take another bold step and that is to ask the Congress to work with us to enact tax reform and tax reductions.\nI'd like to ask Larry to say a few words and I'd like to ask Jack Welch of General Electric to say a few, as well.\nLAWRENCE LINDSEY, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. It's going to be an honor to work with you and it has been an honor to campaign with you. I think we have the right man to lead us the years ahead. So thank you for having me on your team. You've got some work to do, it sounds like from this morning.\nBUSH: Jack?\nJACK WELCH, CEO, GENERAL ELECTRIC: Well, we all appreciate the opportunity to come down here and have an open dialogue with the environment that we're facing.\nIt really has been a significant slowdown in the fourth quarter. Some people say we didn't come back for it very well from the vacation. And it's been steadily declining.\nAnd I think the move by--as you pointed out, Mr. President--Mr. Greenspan was welcomed by everybody here. And we are going to need the bold action that you're proposing to get this economy back on track.\nBUSH: Yes, Tom, a couple of questions.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, first, did you get a heads-up on this rate cut from Mr. Greenspan?\nBUSH: No, I did not.\nQUESTION: And second, do you think that this will possibly make it harder for you to rally bipartisan support for your big tax cut?\nBUSH: Not in the least, because I think that--I think if you were to talk to the business leaders here, they'll tell you that a rate reduction of 0.5 percent is not enough to serve as a stimulus to encourage capital formation, economic growth, job creation; that it's going to require, not only monetary policy reform, but also, fiscal policy reform.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, will Mr. Lindsey be doing both jobs of the Council of Economic Advisors and the National Economic Council, or will you be appointing people to those position, too?\nBUSH: We'll let you know.\n(LAUGHTER)\nNot to diminish Mr. Lindsey, no.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLINDSEY: Are you going to pay me double?\n(LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: As you can see that's the sticking point.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, good afternoon. When you talk about a bold first step when you talk to the members of Congress, in regard to your tax cut relief package, will you lay it out in the aggregate, in other words, the $1.3 trillion package as a single undertaking, or try to spread it out over a legislative year in order to do it incrementally?\nBUSH: I think it's going to be important for us to cut the rates. And I think we are going to need to move quickly to do so. And I mean the rates on everybody who pays taxes.\nI think one of the things you'll find when you talk to some of these business leaders is that there is deep concern about consumer debt; that folks are going to need to have more money in their pockets to not only live but to pay off their debts.\nAll rates--it will help small businesses. There are a lot sole proprietors that create a lot of jobs that are going to need relief in this environment. And so it's important for the Congress to hear that this is a economic recovery plan.\nQUESTION: To follow up, is it your preference to do it in as large a part as possible as soon as possible as opposed to spreading it out over time?\nBUSH: You're talking about the tactics there in the halls of Congress, and my preference is that we get the job done. That's my preference. And whatever it takes to get the full job done is what I support.\nObviously, I'd like to see the rates cut. I'd like to see us get rid of the death tax, and I'd like to see us do something on the marriage penalty as well. But the main part of the discussion here has been about cutting the rates on people who pay taxes.\nBecause the folks in this room understand that when you couple that with interest rate reductions, the fiscal ramifications of a tax rate cut will help spur this economy. And there is a unanimity here that we need to help spur the economy, that the warning signs are real, that people's bottom lines are being affected which hurts the ability for our American citizenry to find work.\nSTAFF: Thank you.\nBUSH: Too bad.\n(LAUGHTER)\nNext time.", "timestamp": "2001-01-03", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference Announcing the Appointment of Larry Lindsey as Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs"}

Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84887", "text": "BUSH: Happy new year to everybody.\nToday it's my honor and privilege to submit three more nominations to my Cabinet.\nFirst, I'm proud to introduce Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, who is my choice to be the secretary of energy.\nSenator Abraham knows the issues of energy policy, and he understands the opportunities and challenges before us. He's ready to join me in seeking energy security for the United States. We understand our national security depends upon energy security.\nIn Michigan, during the campaign, I pledged a comprehensive energy policy for our country. I look forward to working with Senator Abraham to make sure that energy is available and affordable for all Americans. We must meet rising demand for energy with new domestic exploration and production. We must produce and conserve all forms of energy in America. And we must do so in an economically sound and environmentally sensitive way.\nSpence is a veteran of the White House, he understands the Congress and will be an effective member of my Cabinet. I'm honored that he would join us.\nSecondly, I'm going to submit the name of Linda Chavez as the secretary of labor.\nShe's a familiar voice on issues facing American workers, a staunch advocate of civil rights for everybody.\nLinda is smart and capable.\nWe share a passion to make sure that nobody in America is left behind. We share a passion that says as the economy changes, our work force will be trained to meet the new economic opportunities in the 21st century.\nLinda's a well known writer. She is a mother and a grandmother. She understands Washington well. After all, at one time, in her career she was a Democrat staffer. She was a member of a labor union at one point. She has served in a previous Republican administration.\nI'm proud to have Linda on my team.\nAnd finally, it is a great pleasure to announce that Norman Mineta has agreed to become the--have his name submitted as the secretary of transportation.\nSecretary Mineta would bring a lot of experience to the job. He made a reputation in the halls of Congress as someone who understands that a sound infrastructure in America will lead to economic opportunity for all Americans.\nSecretary Mineta and I look forward to working on issues, such as air safety, air travel, preserving the roads and bridges of America, assisting states and local communities in making their infrastructures are modern.\nHe's been an elected official elected at the local level in California, he served with distinction in the United States Congress and is currently President Clinton's United States secretary of commerce.\nIt is with great pleasure that I introduce these three members to you. I can't think of a better way to start the new year than to round out a Cabinet, one that I think is one of the strongest that any president has been ever able to assemble.\nI'd like to introduce Senator Spence Abraham, who'll have a few remarks, as will the other nominees.\nABRAHAM: Mr. President-elect, I just want to begin by thanking you. It's a great honor for me to be asked to join what is already a tremendous team of talented people who will be part of this new administration.\nI want to also say to the vice president-elect, thank you for being part of this process and for including me.\nI just want to say that I think it is a testament to the special place that America is, that the grandson of four Lebanese immigrants can have the opportunity to serve in the Cabinet of the president of the United States. I'm very proud to have been given this opportunity.\nAs we know, many significant Energy Department-related issues face us at this time, ranging from the adequacy of supply to affordability to the development of new technologies to the issues of security at our facilities and more.\nFortunately, this administration is comprised of many individuals with incredible expertise in these areas. And I look forward to helping the president-elect to affectively address these challenges in the days ahead.\nWe have vast resources within the United States, and these are crucial to our country's security. We can make good use of them, while at the same time, I believe, meeting our responsibilities as good stewards for the land, the air and the water. So this is the duty of the next secretary of energy and I am very eager to take up the task. I very much appreciate the chance.\nThank you.\nBUSH: Congratulations.\nLinda Chavez?\nCHAVEZ: Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect.\nIt is a tremendous honor and a great privilege to be here today and to be at this point.\nThere are a whole lot of people who are responsible for my being here, in addition to you and to Vice President-elect Cheney. I first want to thank my husband and my three sons, whose encouragement, patience and support have enabled me to accept the many challenges and opportunities that have come my way.\nBut I'd also like to remember someone who could not be here today, because he did not live to see this day, and that is my father.\nAs a house painter, he taught me the dignity of manual labor. As someone whose own childhood poverty cut short his education in the ninth grade, he nonetheless introduced me to the world of books and ideas. And those are what enabled me to take a path that was easier than his own.\nI also want to thank my mother, who stood on her feet long hours in restaurants and in department stores to help support our family during my childhood, and whose love continues to give me courage.\nIf I am confirmed as secretary of labor, I intend to keep faith with the men and the women who still work at jobs like those my parents held.\nI hope also to seek out new opportunities to increase the skills and the productivity of all Americans, to promote safe working conditions, and to administer the nation's labor laws. I intend to vigorously enforce the department's regulations to guarantee nondiscrimination by federal contractors.\nAnd I want to work with employers to ensure that the department of labor assists the private sector in expanding economic opportunity and job growth.\nPresident-elect Bush, I look forward to working with you as you lead this nation forward with vision, with strength and with compassion. Thank you very much for the honor of being here today.\nBUSH: Mr. Secretary?\nMINETA: Thank you very much, President-elect Bush.\nOver the last year, this country has witnessed a very hard-fought election. And I was proud to stand with my party. I have been honored to serve in President Clinton's Cabinet as secretary of commerce. I am a Democrat, with both a small \"d\" and a large one.\nAnd I am proud of and committed to my party's principles and it's heritage.\nHowever, the campaign is over. And under our constitutional system, a decision has been rendered. And we are now in the essential transition period when we move from campaigning to governance.\nAs you have said time and time again, Mr. President-elect, the challenge before all of us as Americans, regardless of party affiliation, is to find those areas where we can build bipartisan consensus on the policies and the programs that are needed to move this nation forward.\nNow that sentiment has been echoed in comments made by both President Clinton and Vice President Gore, and I share it completely.\nIn my career as a city council member, and mayor of San Jose, California, and as a member of Congress, and as a business person and, since July, the secretary of commerce, I have always tried to build that kind of consensus.\nI believe that there is no more fertile ground for building a bipartisan consensus on what is necessary and right for our country than in the area of transportation policy. There are no Democratic or Republican highways, no such thing as Republican or Democratic traffic congestion, no such thing as Republican or Democratic aviation and highway safety.\nCargo is not shipped by Republican or Democratic railroad ships, barges or pipelines.\nOur national transportation policy must have one overriding bipartisan goal, and that is to give our economy the tools and the infrastructure it needs in order to create and sustain growth and prosperity.\nIn particular, it is no accident that in the areas in our nation where the economy has excelled, the number one issue is improving the transportation system. Inadequate infrastructure is one of the chief threats to a thriving economy.\nOurs is a dynamic and evolving society and our transportation policies must reflect and nurture that reality. That is a belief that all of us share, and it is certainly one on which the president-elect, the vice president-elect and I strongly agree.\nI am honored that President-elect Bush has sought my participation in his Cabinet. And I look forward to working with him and the Congress to face the challenges that will be presented to the Department of Transportation in the coming years.\nI am also honored to have the opportunity to once work again with my friend and former colleague, Vice President-elect Cheney, and with the White House chief of staff-designate, Andy Card, with whom I worked closely during his tenure as secretary of transportation.\nThank you, again, Mr. President-elect, for this honor and for providing me this truly unique opportunity to serve our nation.\nI promise you and the American people that I will do my best to make you and them proud of our nation's transportation system.\nThank you very, much.\nBUSH: I'll take a few questions in the spirit of the year 2001.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, given President Clinton's meeting with Arafat, I wonder if you're concerned at all if the current administration's in any way tying your hands at the 11th hour on the Middle East.\nBUSH: No. I'm appreciative of the fact that the president is working endlessly to try to bring the parties together to achieve a lasting peace. I appreciate his efforts. He's a man, obviously, who's going to work up to the last minute of the last day of his administration, which is what the American people expect, and so do I. And I appreciate so very much his strong attempt.\nFollow up on this?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nBUSH: This will be the only question you get. Make sure it's the right one.\nQUESTION: Do you see any reason to believe that the Israelis and Palestinians will sign a peace deal in the next 18 days before your inauguration, or by the Israeli election time of February 6?\nBUSH: It's hard for me to tell from my perspective. But I do know we have one president, and our nation will speak with one voice. And the voice with which we'll speak is the voice of President Clinton. And as I say, he's giving it the very best shot he can, and I certainly hope it works.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, OPEC plans to cut oil production by a million and a half barrels on January 17. Are you concerned this will affect the current heating oil situation or raise gas prices in the future? And would you consider raising the issue with the Saudis or other OPEC members before that January 17 meeting?\nBUSH: No, the nation needs to speak with one voice.\nWe have one president. But the fact that OPEC is thinking about reducing world supply of crude oil and thereby affecting the price at the pump and the price of heating oil, indicates the need for us to have an energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of crude.\nThe ideal world is one in which we don't have to worry about somebody reducing supplies on the world markets. We've got a long way to go from there. But we need to be exploring in an environmentally-sensitive way for oil and gas here at home.\nSecondly, a cornerstone of our diplomatic efforts will be to work with our friends in the Middle East, particularly as it relates to matters of energy.\nBut no, the president of the United States will be the president until January the 20th, and our nation will speak with one voice.\nQUESTION: You've now named a Cabinet that was very diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity and experienced in private sector and federal government. What does your Cabinet say, do you think, about your management style, about how you intend to make decisions as president?\nBUSH: I appreciate that.\nFirst, it says I'm not afraid to surround myself with strong and competent people. I believe the American people want a president who seeks the best; people from all walks of life who are strong, experienced, capable Americans. I'm going to work with every Cabinet member to set a series of goals for each Cabinet--for each area of our government. And I'll work with the Cabinet secretaries to help achieve those goals. But I fully expect to get--I fully expect to be given a straightforward talk, an honest opinion. And I expect people to work for one thing in mind: that which is best for America.\nNow, I'm proud of this Cabinet. And I hope the American people realize that a good executive is one that understands how to recruit people and how to delegate, how to line authority and responsibility, how to hold people accountable for results, and how to build a team of people.\nAnd that's exactly what we're going to do. This is a team of people who will be dedicated to doing what is right for America.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, as you prepare your economic plan to submit to Congress, I'm wondering if you could tell us, do you believe, sir, that if you cut taxes, whether it's the marriage penalty or marginal rates, revenues to the federal government necessarily increase; that is to say, you adopt the Reagan philosophy that lower taxes create a revenue source for the government, they do not create deficits. Or do you believe tax cuts could create deficit problems in the future?\nBUSH: Well, a couple of things: The tax relief package that I talked about in the campaign, was phased-in based upon projections so that we wouldn't run a deficit.\nSecondly, I do believe that a properly structured tax relief plan will cause revenues eventually to go up. I believe that a tax relief package, if properly structured--and I'm confident ours is properly structured--will encourage economic growth and vitality and more job creation.\nAnd I am concerned, as I have said, that there are some warning signs on the horizon. This is an administration that certainly hopes the economy remains strong. It'll make our job a heck of a lot easier. But ours is going to be an administration that anticipates any potential problem. And I'm worried about an economic slow down, and I believe it is important for us to ensure against any economic slow down by a responsible tax relief package.\nQUESTION: You've taken great pains, obviously, to diversify your Cabinet, but are you concerned that with the nomination of Senator Ashcroft and specifically the battle that's brewing, coming from civil rights groups and others, that that will undercut that accomplishment in any way?\nBUSH: Well, first of all, I would hope that all of our nominations sail through, but that's not generally the way it goes. I'm sure there's going to be some tough questioning for some of our nominees.\nBut they're all fully prepared to handle the tough questioning.\nAnd I hope people do talk to John Ashcroft about his vision of civil rights and his concept of fairness in America because I certainly did. I want to remind you that he was the man who became the attorney general of the state of Missouri. He was elected as the governor of the state of Missouri and as United States senator in the state of Missouri; a man who has a record of taking his heart and philosophy to the people of a swing state and got elected. And I'm confident that he'll withstand the scrutiny about his fairness and his heart.\nUnfortunately, sometimes politics enters into the confirmation process. I understand that, and so does he. But I'm confident that when it's all said and done, Senator Ashcroft will be confirmed by the Senate.\nQUESTION: Jesse Jackson has said, specifically, that he will lead a charge against Senator Ashcroft. I'm wondering if that complicates both your effort to meet with Reverend Jackson and your effort to reach out to minority groups, specifically African-Americans?\nBUSH: Well, I find--I mean, Jesse Jackson is--in the great land of America, can do anything he wants to do; he can try to block any nomination he wants. But I think those who are going to make the determination as to whether or not any of these nominees get confirmed, the United States senators, if they are objective and they take a look at, in this case, Senator Ashcroft's heart and his record, they'll confirm him.\nYes?\nQUESTION: To follow up, are you concerned that the looming fight over Senator Ashcroft's nomination might not enable you to start uniting the country, that partisanship will explode on Capitol Hill?\nAnd can you share with us any other steps you might take besides appointing Secretary Mineta to help that process?\nBUSH: Well, yes, I intend to continue to reach out to Democrats, to discuss with Democrats ways to get an education bill through the Congress, or ways to work on patients' bill of rights or Medicare reform. I understand how the legislative process works. I really understand it when there's a split Senate, in terms of reaching out to both parties.\nThe first part of your question was about Senator Ashcroft: Do I worry that a nomination battle is going to make it harder for me to unite? No, I don't. I mean, nomination battles are part and parcel of the country. There's going to be some tough questioning. But I'm confident that when people look at John Ashcroft's record and listen to what he has to say, and realize that he's going to enforce the law and not politicize the attorney general's office, he will be confirmed.\nYes, sir?\nQUESTION: Mr. President, happy new year.\nBUSH: And to you and yours.\nQUESTION: You've talked about, during the campaign, that you and Vice President Gore have raised many of the same issues, although you differ on proposed solutions. And no disrespect intended, sir, the other side got more--more voters sided with the issues of the other side. So to what extent are you in a mindset to embrace some of the issues offered by the other side?\nBUSH: Well, first, had I thought the campaign was--the candidate who won the most votes would be the president, I would have campaigned differently. For example, I might have spent a little more time and a little more time in my own state of Texas trying to maximize the popular vote. But I campaigned as if the one who got the most electoral votes would become the president.\nSecondly, I believe the reason I'm standing here is because of the agenda I articulated during the course of the campaign. And I intend to take that agenda, that I tried to spell out as clearly as I could to the American people, to the halls of Congress.\nQUESTION: Last question, Mr. President-elect: Can you talk about why you feel it was important to have a Democrat in your Cabinet, besides the qualifications of Mr. Mineta, the symbolism that you feel it might bring?\nBUSH: You bet. First, I don't want to skip over the qualifications. This man is perfectly suited for the job. He made a career in the halls of Congress focusing on transportation issues with a philosophy that we share. And I can't wait for people in our party to hear Norm talk about his vision for transportation.\nBut it's also important to send a signal that this is an administration that recognizes talent when we see it regardless of political party. And this is an extraordinarily talented American. I love his story. I'm so honored that he agreed to join the administration. And he's going to make a great addition.\nI wish everybody a continued happy new year. I look forward to seeing you at the next availability.\nQUESTION: When will that be?\nBUSH: Good question. See you later.", "timestamp": "2001-01-02", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference Announcing the Nominations of Spencer Abraham as Secretary of Energy, Linda Chavez as Secretary of Labor, and Norman Mineta as Secretary of Transportation"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84889", "text": "BUSH: Good afternoon--or good morning. I have the honor of announcing four more Cabinet nominees today.\nFirst, Department of Education: I looked for someone who is a reformer and someone who had a record of results, someone who understands that it is important for us to set the highest of high standards, and not accept excuse--failures--any excuse for failure. I want an educator who had proven that urban schools can be excellent schools, and Rod Paige is the right person.\nRod has had experience at every level in education. He's been a college dean, he's elected as a school board member and he is serving as a superintendent of the Houston Independent School District. I know him well.\nHe believes as I do, that accountability is the foundation of true education reform. He understands that we have the need to make sure we don't shuffle children through our system, we don't give up on any child, regardless of their background. He believes that parents ought to be trusted in making decisions for their children.\nHe believes that every child can learn, and every school can succeed in America. I'm really proud that he's accepted the nomination.\nFor the Department of the Interior, our country needs a leader who will respect the land and honor our national commitment to conservation.\nTo serve as the 48th secretary of the Interior, I will nominate Gale Norton of Colorado. Gale is a former attorney general of Colorado with a reputation for building consensus on divisive issues.\nIn my administration, she'll have a clear charge. We will restore our national parks system. We will develop partnerships with states and local governments and private citizens to conserve our lands and resources and to protect the endangered species of America.\nWe will find ways to develop our nations' resources in a balanced and an environmentally friendly way.\nDuring my campaign, I pledged that we would honor our veterans just as they have honored our country. I also pledged that veterans would have an advocate leading the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nMy choice for that position, Tony Prinicipi, will serve Americans who have served our country.\nTony is well-known amongst the veterans. After all, he is a highly decorated veteran--Vietnam War veteran.\nI'm asking him to take the lead in modernizing the Veterans' health care system, so all our veterans are treated with dignity. Tony understands that one of our goals will be to make sure that claims will be processed faster.\nAnd the VA will return to the basic principle that it has a duty to assist veterans who are seeking benefits. In my administration, veterans will have a strong and constant ally, not only in the president, but in the secretary of veterans affairs.\nAnd finally, for the Department of Health and Human Services, I've chosen one of our nation's finest governors. I know this man very well; I know his record; I know his ability to lead.\nTommy has been a creative, conservative, compassionate governor of Wisconsin. Real welfare reform began in Wisconsin, and has been duplicated in other states. He's a leader and innovator. He's also been a champion of education reform and for opportunity for disadvantaged Americans. He will bring creativity and conviction to Washington, D.C. It is such an honor to have Tommy Thompson agree to leave the position of governor of Wisconsin to come and serve our nation.\nAnd so, it is with great proud that I announce the four candidates today. I'm going to ask each one of the candidates to say a few words. After they speak, I'm heading back to Austin.\nI want you all to have a happy holiday season and a great new year, and I look forward to seeing you after the New Year celebration.\nSo, first, it's my honor to bring to the podium Mr. Rod Paige of Houston, Texas.\nPAIGE: Mr. President-elect, thank you for this tremendous honor. I'm humbled by your faith and confidence in me.\nAnd I want you to know that I won't let you down.\nIf I'm honored to be confirmed by the Senate, I will dedicate myself everyday to the task of assuring that no child in America will be left behind.\nMr. President-elect, I also want to thank you for your support of the Houston Independent School District.\nSir, I am only one of more than a thousand school superintendents in Texas who saw your compassion for our young people up close. We knew it was one thing for our candidate for political office to talk about better schools, and it's quite another to back that talk up with action.\nWe noticed right away that you didn't just talk the talk; you walked the walk. You indeed have been the education governor, and you will be the education president, too.\nYou see we know that if expectations are set high and if educators and parents work hard together, every child can thrive. The bottom line is this: When we set high standards for our schools and our children and when we give our schools and our children the support they need and hold them accountable for results, public education can get the job done.\nI want to thank the Board of Trustees of the Houston Independent School District for its outstanding leadership and the citizens of Houston for their support of their schools.\nMr. President-elect, you made education a cornerstone of your campaign. Those of us in education know you meant it when you said, \"No child is to be left behind.\"\nSir, thank you again for this honor.\nBUSH: Good job. Thanks. Gale?\nNORTON: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. It is an incredible honor for me to be nominated as secretary of the Interior.\nThe issues I will face if I am confirmed will be challenging and important ones, and I look forward to tackling them.\nFrom the time I was a young child growing up in Colorado, I have loved the Rocky Mountains, a place to hike with my dog watching elk in a grove of aspen trees, or contemplate the eternity gazing at jagged mountain peaks. In fact, if it were not for a call from the Bush transition team, my husband, John, and I would be skiing in those mountains today.\nFrom the ancient ruins of Mesa Verde to the grandeur of Yosemite Valley and the vast open lands of the West, from the untamed wilderness of Alaska to our historic treasures in Washington, D.C., the public lands of the United States are amazing places. To be asked to take on the job of managing a large portion of those beautiful and special places is an awesome responsibility.\nI welcome the opportunity to work with President-elect Bush to preserve our wonderful, national treasures, to restore endangered species, and to help Americans enjoy the great outdoors.\nAn entire one-third of our land is owned by the federal government. Together with the other departments that own that land, the Department of the Interior faces the challenge of seeing that our land is used in an environmentally responsible way. We must build strong partnerships, as the president-elect said, with states, local governments, and private citizens to make thoughtful decisions about natural resources.\nI bring to this task a special experience in working with government as it should be. When I was attorney general of Colorado, I worked together in a bipartisan way, with attorneys general from across the country. We tackled many difficult issues and overcame a diversity of viewpoints to find common ground. I look forward to drawing upon that bipartisan tradition, as I tackle new challenges.\nThank you.\nBUSH: Good job. Very good.\nTony?\nPRINICIPI: President-elect Bush, I'm humbled that you have entrusted me with the mission of honoring your commitment to the men and women whose military service preserved America's freedoms.\nShortly after he immigrated to this country, my father, like so many gallant Americans, joined the ranks of the men and women who came to be described as the greatest generation, because of their service in World War II.\nOur fathers were members of a great generation, just as were their younger brothers and sisters who turned back aggression in Korea, their children who endured severe hardships in Vietnam, and their grandchildren who earned a great victory in the Persian Gulf, just as were the unheralded millions, who stood ready on the ramparts of freedom during the decades of the Cold War, and those who serve today throughout the world. And I'm proud two of my sons are among them.\nAmerica now reaps the fruit of the service of 24 million veterans. However, their service imposes upon us a reciprocal obligation. The president-elect has charged me with the mission of transforming that obligation into the benefits and services earned by generations of veterans. I am proud to respond to that call, just as those veterans responded when their country called upon them.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, I know that I will face great challenges, but no worthwhile mission is without challenge. I know of no mission more worthwhile than serving the men and women who have so honorably served their nation.\nI accept the challenge, knowing that I have the full support of the president, the assistance of VA's 200,000 very dedicated employees, the partnership of the America's veteran service organizations, and certainly the commitment of a caring nation.\nThank you, President-elect Bush, for this great honor.\nBUSH: Good job. You read it just like I wrote it.\n(LAUGHTER)\nGovernor Thompson?\nTHOMPSON: Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect, and let me add that it is a real honor as a fellow Republican governor to be able to say that.\nBUSH: Thank you.\nTHOMPSON: I have a great deal of humbleness and great deal of support and confidence in you.\nFellow Cabinet designees, it's an honor to be associated with such outstanding people. I thank you so very much.\nLet me begin by thanking you all, but thanking you, Mr. President-elect, for entrusting me with such tremendous responsibility. As your nominee for the secretary of health and human service, it's a humbling honor and an incredible challenge, a challenge that I will embrace enthusiastically and with great passion.\nAs we all know, the issues that were prominent on President-elect Bush's campaign agenda are the issues that, predominantly, the Department of the Health and Human Services will help him tackle over the next four years, and I appreciate the confidence that he is showing in me today.\nFor those here who may not know much about me, let me give you some very short insights by saying this. Welfare reform, health care reform, long-term care for seniors, greater opportunities for the disabled, helping the poor find work and helping the working-poor find rewards in their efforts, biotechnology and scientific research: I am absolutely passionate about these issues.\nThese are issues I have dedicated 35 years of public service to solving, the last 14, as governor of my great state of Wisconsin. And should I be confirmed, I would be fortunate to add Social Security reform and others to the list, as well as have the opportunity to address all these issues at the federal level.\nThese are all tough issues, but solving tough issues is why I got into this business, and I know it is why President-elect Bush sought this job and why he traversed such a grueling road to get the opportunity to lead this great nation.\nBut while excited about these issues and challenges at HHS, they alone are not the reason that I would leave my beloved state of Wisconsin and a job I love very much to come to Washington, D.C. I will do so, because I believe so very much in George W. Bush, and more than that, the agenda for America that he is seeking to accomplish.\nThis is a man, a leader, who wants to bring about meaningful changes to better the lives of all of our citizens.\nI personally was so excited to see a presidential candidate from our party who is finally willing to put these social issues front and center in his campaign, a leader who is bold enough to stand up and say, he was going to ignore the safe politics and take on the tough challenges facing the people of America: the third-rail issues of Social Security, health care for working families, Medicare reform and prescription drugs, welfare reform, and improving our underperforming schools, issues that make a difference in everybody's lives.\nAnd it is inspiring to see a leader in President-elect Bush who isn't afraid to call all of us to action as we address these difficult problems, a leader who recognizes that government alone cannot reduce poverty or solve societal issues; it takes all of us working together as partners, including the faith community. George Bush is a man who wants to solve the unsolvable problems, and he, he knows how to get job done.\nKeep in mind, a compassionate conservative is a person of action, not one of words, for compassion means being bold, and courageous enough to act and to lead.\nIt will be an honor to serve the president, as he aggressively works to make the lives of millions of Americans better, and restore hope and opportunity for those who have been left behind in this great country. This is going to be an administration of action, and I am very proud to be part of it.\nBUSH: Good job, Tommy. Thank you all.\nThank you all very much. I hope everybody has a great New Year's celebration. See you down in Austin next week. God bless.\nQUESTION: Why are you in such a rush to leave?\n(UNKNOWN): Happy New Year, my friend.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: Are you Democrat or Republican?\nPAIGE: I'm a Republican, sir.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Were you elected as a Republican when you were elected to the school board?\nPAIGE: It was a nonpartisan race in Houston.\nQUESTION: Dr. Paige, you have had a connection (OFF-MIKE) can you talk about what it's like for you (OFF-MIKE) now being in the Cabinet? Your own personal facts (ph)?\nPAIGE: It's kind a surreal experience. I have known and admired the Bush family for a long period of time. I didn't realize that it was quite that long, but it has been a family that I have respected for their commitment to society and for their dedication and hard work to our country, and I am just pleased to be able to play a small part in it.\nQUESTION: I wonder if you could tell us what is the single biggest problem of public education in this country? (OFF-MIKE)\nPAIGE: I don't think that there is any single. I think that there are enough of vulnerabilities in the way that we do schooling for all of us to take some responsibility for our improving it.\nI think the public is where we need to begin our work. This is a public system, it is for the public's benefit, it is a public good, and the public must bring itself together and work hard to achieve it.\nQUESTION: Governor Thompson, some pro-lifers have expressed concern about your position on fetal tissue research. Can you talk about your position on that, and your position generally on the pro-life or pro-choice issue?\nTHOMPSON: I am a pro-life governor. And as you all know, I chaired the platform committee for the Republican Party, and everybody knows that I listen to everybody and will continue to do so. And my views on these issues, I will be more than happy to discuss when the Senate has my confirmation hearing.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: Secretary Shalala, this week, surprised a lot of people by refusing to endorse the proposal to reinforce drug (OFF-MIKE). Will you reverse that decision if you become Secretary?\nTHOMPSON: I will be taking a look at that, but at this point in time I have not made a decision as to what my position would be.\nQUESTION: Ms. Norton, may I ask you a question: As interior secretary, what is your position on the reaction by the Clinton administration to fence off vast acreage of western land? And will the Bush administration try to reverse it--these decisions?\nNORTON: The West was concerned about those decisions, in large part, because there was no consultation with the people whose lives were most affected by land withdrawals by the Clinton administration.\nI will be discussing those issues with the Senate as part of my confirmation hearings. At this time, I have no position on what the incoming administration will be doing as to those designations.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: What about drilling in the ANWR?\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) once they've been established?\nNORTON: That is an issue that we will have to examine as part of the confirmation hearings. It is not appropriate for me to comment at this point.\nQUESTION: What about drilling in the ANWR?\nNORTON: President-elect Bush took a position as part of his campaign that, because of the need to balance environmental protection and also our need to utilize the resources of the public lands, that we should explore opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration.\nThe belief is that there are huge amounts of oil available in that area. That is an issue, again, that I cannot comment on in terms of my own actions on that, but I do support the president in the positions that he has taken during his campaign.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: Dr. Paige, last week you told us you didn't think you were going take the job because you had unfinished business in Houston. What changed your mind? And what experience do you think you'll use in this job?\nPAIGE: I don't think I've ever made an emphatic statement like that. I did enjoy my responsibility in Houston, and it is with some concern that I leave, because I enjoyed it there. It's a great city. But this is a big responsibility that I think I can help with; I think I can make a difference, and I want to take that opportunity to do it.\nQUESTION: Governor Thompson, your statement on behalf of the public schools, does that indicate your point of view on sending children to private schools with public money?\nSTAFF: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2000-12-29", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference Announcing the Nominations of Rod Paige as Secretary of Education, Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior, and Anthony Principi as Secretary of Veterans Affairs"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84899", "text": "BUSH: Good afternoon. Thank you for coming today.\nToday it is my honor to announce that I'm submitting the name of Donald Rumsfeld to be secretary of defense.\nThere's no question in my mind that his record of service to the country is extraordinary. Former chief of staff, CEO, former secretary of defense, this is a man who has got great judgment, he has got strong vision, and he's going to be a great secretary of defense, again.\n(LAUGHTER)\nOur mission for the next four years will be to build a durable peace. This will require strong alliances, expanding trade, advancing our ideals and interests with a clear and consistent diplomacy. With General Powell serving as the secretary of state, that mission is in very good hands.\nBut the foundation of peace is to have a military ready to keep the peace, ready for every danger, equal to every challenge.\nToday, American armed forces have an irreplaceable role in our world. They give confidence to our allies, they deter the aggression of our enemies.\nI've set three goals for our nation's defense. One is to strengthen the bond of trust between the American president and those who wear our nation's uniform. Secondly is defend our people and allies against missiles and terror. And thirdly is to begin creating a military prepared for the dangers of a new century.\nStrengthen the bond of trust between the president and the military, rebuilding morale, it means never forgetting that ours is a military of volunteers. Whether someone is in the active forces or Reserves or Guard, they're their at their own choosing, and we must honor that service by better pay, better training and clear missions with attainable goals.\nWe hope to never send our troops into combat. But if deterrence were to fail, we must send them fully prepared and equipped for the dangers that they will face.\nSecondly, to defend our forces and allies and our own country from the threat of missile attack or accidental launch, we must develop a missile defense system.\nI was most impressed by the chairman of the national commission's ballistic missile threats work. That chairman was Don Rumsfeld. I felt he did an extraordinary job with a delicate assignment. He brought people together to understand the realities of the modern world.\nIn picking Don Rumsfeld, we'll have a person who is thoughtful and considerate and wise on the subject of missile defense.\nAnd, finally, we must work to change our military to meet the threats of a new century. Effective military power is increasingly defined not by size or mass but by mobility and swiftness. Influence is measure in information. Safety is gained in stealth.\nWe've got a great opportunity in America to redefine how wars are fought and won, and therefore how the peace is kept. Our nation is positioned well to use technologies to redefine the military. And so one of Secretary Rumsfeld's first tasks will be to challenge the status quo inside the Pentagon, to develop a strategy necessary to have a force equipped for warfare of the 21st century.\nIt's going to take a lot of cooperation and close work with the Congress. Both of us pledge to do just that.\nAnd so, it is my honor to bring forth a man who will be an integral part of a national security team that I'm confident will serve America's interests well, a good man, an honorable man, Mr. Don Rumsfeld.\nRUMSFELD: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.\nGood afternoon, President-elect Bush and Dick Cheney. I thank you for those very generous words and for your confidence in asking me to return to public service, which I'm delighted to do.\nI look forward to serving our country again and, under your leadership, working with the very fine national security team you are assembling, my former associate and colleague Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Condi Rice, and your director of Central Intelligence, whoever that may be.\n(LAUGHTER)\nRUMSFELD: And I guess we can confirm today, Mr. President-elect, that it's not me.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI've admired your leadership in Texas. I have valued our discussions on defense issues over the many months. I have studied carefully your address and blue print for defense that you outlined at the Citadel, and I support it enthusiastically.\nIn your address there, you called for America's capabilities to be designed to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It is clearly not a time at the Pentagon for presiding or calibrating modestly. Rather, we are in a new national security environment. We do need to be arranged to deal with the new threats, not the old ones, as you point out, with information warfare, missile defense, terrorism, defense of our space assets and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction throughout the world.\nHistory teaches us that weakness is provocative. The task you have outlined is to fashion deterrence and defense capabilities, so that our country will be able to successfully contribute to peace and stability in the world.\nI look forward to building a team at the Defense Department that, as you mentioned, can help to develop bipartisan support for the many tasks ahead.\nIt's a great institution, the Defense Department, with a proud heritage, and with enormously talented and courageous people. I look forward to serving with them again and, under your leadership, serving with you and your team.\nSir, I thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, much has been made about how long it took you to make this decision. I wonder if you could comment on that and also tell us whether you have a target for completing your Cabinet.\nBUSH: I thought I moved pretty quickly. I can't remember the exact date the election was finally certified, but...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... I know it was 35 days or 36 days after it was supposed to have ended.\nBut I felt like we're making pretty good progress. And I hope to have the Cabinet completed at the end of the first week of January. Don't hold me to it, though.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, during the campaign, you spoke a lot about military--the decline in military morale and readiness. But since the election, you've focused on education and tax relief. So what priority will you give rebuilding the military in your first 100 days?\nAnd, perhaps, Secretary-designate Rumsfeld?\nBUSH: Well, first, in my budget, I can assure you, there's going to be a military pay raise greater than the pay raise which was enacted a year ago.\nAnd secondly, I've always believed that we're going to have a selling job to do on Congress as to how to modernize the military.\nAnd that requires, first and foremost, a top-to-bottom--a bottom-to-top review of what exists today and what the military ought to look like tomorrow. And that's going to be one of Don Rumsfeld's first jobs.\nAs to missile defense, there's a selling job to do there as well. But a good place to start is the report that he put out, which is a compelling argument of the need for the United States to develop a missile defense system that will work.\nAnd so, Patsy, part of our job is to make sure the budget is right for the military. But part of our job in the executive branch is to provide a blueprint for change, a strategy, and then go to the Hill and sell it. I'll work with Don and Dick to do just that.\nRussert.\nQUESTION: I yield to Nora.\nBUSH: We've just made history.\n(LAUGHTER)\nNora?\nMost thoughtful of you. Please take note of the generosity of spirit here, a senior correspondent such as Russert lateralling a question to one of his colleagues.\nYes, ma'am?\nQUESTION: I'll yield then back to Tim.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: If that's the case, this press conference is over.\nQUESTION: I wonder, President-elect, and also the secretary can address, what kind of influence Powell and Vice President-elect Cheney will then have over the Pentagon, given certainly his experience and Powell's stature?\nBUSH: Well, I think little, because I picked a strong leader who is willing to listen to others but is a decisive leader.\nSecondly, inherent in your question is the arrangement that's going to be, you know, inside the national security apparatus of the White House.\nI think that those who follow American diplomacy and politics understand that I've assembled a team of very strong, smart people. And I look forward to hearing their advice.\nOne of the things that's really important for the American people understand is, I'll be getting some of the best counsel possible. And so, you bet, General Powell's a strong figure and Dick Cheney's no shrinking violet...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... but neither is Don Rumsfeld, nor Condi Rice. I view the four as being able to complement each other.\nThere's going to be disagreements. I hope there is disagreement, because I know that disagreement will be based upon solid thought. And what you need to know is that if there is disagreement, I'll be prepared to make the decision necessary for the good of the country.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bush, you talked about the need for missile defense, the pay raise, where's all this money going to come from?\nBUSH: Well, the pay raise is $1 billion, John. And I think it's easily attainable in the budget.\nThe missile defense, there is money being spent now on missile defense. But one of the things Secretary Rumsfeld will do is to work with our OMB director to make sure that the missile defense receives the priority we think it must receive in future Pentagon budgets.\nQUESTION: Would you push the Palestinians and Israelis, at this point, to conclude a peace treaty? Or would you allow the status quo? And do you favor this Clinton plan, which in effect calls for a de facto division of Jerusalem?\nBUSH: We have one president, and we'll have one president, and the current president is President Clinton. And our nation must speak with one voice, and therefore, his is the voice that needs to speak.\nHaving said that, I will tell you, I'm impressed by these efforts to bring the folks together. Obviously, we hope it works. We hope it works.\nQUESTION: Do you believe that the majority of the American people think that it is appropriate that your nominee for attorney general be asked, quote, \"tough questions\" by Vermont's Senator Leahy who voted to condone what Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled was lying under oath and obstruction of justice?\nBUSH: I suspect all my nominees will get tough questions, including Don Rumsfeld. But the good news is that they can all answer the question.\nAnd I am confident that, when it's all said and done, the Senate will give our folks good hearings, and I'm confident they'll be confirmed. And I stand by my choices and will all the way through the process, because I made them for certain reasons, starting with the fact that these good Americans can do the job and do it well.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, are you having trouble getting a Democrat to join your administration?\nBUSH: That's an interesting question.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI'm not having any trouble getting Democrats to return my phone calls.\nQUESTION: That's a different question, sir.\nBUSH: Yes, it was, but the same answer.\nYou know, we've talked to some Democrats. I've talked to Democrats about their willingness to work with us in Congress. I've talked to some Democrats about whether or not there may be an interest of leaving their current positions, and most people want to stay in place.\nI think that it's pretty well-known that John Breaux and I had an early conversation. I never offered him a Cabinet position, but I did talk generically about his interests. And I said in Austin, Texas--I don't know if you were there or not--but when John was there, I said, you know, he wants to stay in the Senate, which I think is good news, in many ways, because he's a person with whom I can work. As I told him down there, the only thing that separates John and me is the Sabine River, at least the way we think.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, President Clinton announced just a while ago that he's not going to North Korea. First, do you support his decision, given the current situation in the country, the missile program? And secondly, what will be the biggest difference between the Bush administration's policy for East Asia--Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula--and the Clinton administration's East Asia policy, of which you have been quite critical?\nBUSH: On this matter, on all matters between now and the inauguration, the country must speak with the one voice. The president made the decision he thought was important.\nSecondly, let me get sworn in first.\nBUSH: And if there are differences, they'll become apparent as a result of what we do and how we act.\nSTAFF: Final question.\nQUESTION: While your appointments to the Cabinet have been moving along publicly at pretty good pace, what's going on with preparation of your budget? And, you know, behind the scenes, there are a whole lot of other projects that you need to do...\nBUSH: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: ... in short order. So how do you feel that process is coming along? Will things come in on time? Do you expect to tinker with it later? What's the status of that?\nBUSH: I think we're making pretty darn good progress on the budget. As a matter of fact, Ari can brief you afterwards. But I believe the White House said that we'll have the budget--Mr. Cogan, who is handling our budget transition, will be giving a look at the current--what?\nQUESTION: The OMB budget?\nBUSH: Yes, the OMB budget.\nFeel like we're making very good progress there. It's a very legitimate question. Mitch Daniels is who I've designated to be the OMB director. Mitch feels confident that our budget will be ready on time.\nAs to the deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries and legal counsels for all the departments, again, we feel like we're making pretty darn good progress, but it's hard to move quickly until we get the secretaries named. And, obviously, we've been somewhat delayed in that as a result of the election taking a little longer than most people anticipated it would.\nBut let me just put it to you this way: On Inauguration Day, we'll be ready to assume our respective offices.\nI want to thank you all. I hope everybody has a good New Year. And by the way, see you in the morning.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: Who with?\nBUSH: I'm not supposed to say anything, I'm sorry.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI'm learning the discipline. I'm learning life within the bubble.\n(LAUGHTER)\nYes?\nQUESTION: Can we ask Mr. Rumsfeld one more question about what it'd be like coming back again as secretary of defense.\nBUSH: Sure, absolutely.\nRUMSFELD: Well, I won't know that until I make my calls up on Capitol Hill, to the Senate, and go through the confirmation process.\nBut I have been doing a number of things with respect to national security and foreign policies issues in the intervening years, and I look forward to it. I really do. It's a fine institution and a wonderful group of people. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Rumsfeld, are you going to take another look at gays in the military?\nRUMSFELD: I tell you, this has all happened very rapidly, and I intend to sit down and go through the confirmation process and think about a host of things. That is not an issue that President-elect Bush has discussed in his pronouncements on defense, and certainly, the priorities are in other areas for me.\nQUESTION: Has he discussed it with you in your conversations?\nRUMSFELD: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: Do you regard the missile threat as real, and where do they come from?\nRUMSFELD: I'm sorry, I couldn't understand.\nQUESTION: Do you regard, sir, the missile threats for which (inaudible) have designed as real or potential? Because the Russians, for instance, say that there is no threat, at this point, to America.\nRUMSFELD: There's no question but that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the delivery systems for them is extensive across the world. There is no question but that a number of nations are supplying other nations with elements that they need and assisting them in bypassing the normal period of years it would take them to develop these capabilities.\nAnd I consider that, myself, to be a real threat.\nAnd it exists among other threats: Terrorism is a threat, cruise missiles are threats, information warfare is a threat. There's vulnerability to space assets. There are any number of things that need to be addressed. But in answer to your question, certainly it's a real threat.\nQUESTION: Is the Star Wars program in need of reinvigoration? Has the Clinton administration...\nSTAFF: Thank you.

{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84882", "text": "PRESIDENT-ELECT BUSH: Good morning. Thank you all for coming.\nToday it's my honor to send to the United States Senate the name of Senator John Ashcroft to become the attorney general of the United States.\nI understand this, that an effective attorney general must be a person of proven character and executive ability.\nAs I looked around to find the appropriate person to lead this important office, I looked for three things: One, a person of unquestionable integrity. Secondly, somebody who knows how to manage, an executive, somebody who can handle a large agency. And thirdly, I wanted someone who would have a commitment to fair and firm and impartial administration of justice.\nI'm confident I found that person in John Ashcroft. He now holds the Senate seat that Harry Truman held. He was elected to office in the great state of Missouri, elected as the attorney general of that state, elected twice as the governor of the state of Missouri. He's had a distinguished record in public service.\nJohn Ashcroft will perform his duties guided by principle, not by politics. He will be faithful to the law, pursuing justice without favor. He will enforce the law and he will follow the truth.\nIt is my honor to send this good man's name to the United States Senate to be the 79th attorney general of the United States.\nSenator Ashcroft?\nASHCROFT: Mr. President-elect, let me begin by thanking you, thanking you for the kind words, thanking you for your commitment to justice, and for your call to service. And Janet and I are profoundly grateful.\nJanet, as you well know, I wouldn't want to be here without you.\nAlmost every day for the last six years, I've walked past the back of the United States Supreme Court building on my way to my Senate desk. Last week, when the most recent Congress ended, so too did my routine.\nAnd on the final day of the session, I recall walking past the high court, beneath the words etched in marble: \"Justice, the guardian of liberty.\" That inscription, if less quoted than its counterpart, \"Equal justice under law,\" is no less profound. And both perfectly capture my aspiration in serving the next president and in working in the Department of Justice.\nQuite simply, we will strive to be a guardian of liberty and equal justice. For freedom, as President-elect Bush has noted, can flourish only in a culture defined by the rule of law, a rule of law that knows no class, that sees no color, and bows to no creed. It is a rule of law that has been elemental to the American experiment since our very first days. The pursuit of liberty and equal justice for every citizen requires that we foster integrity in the nation's highest law enforcement office.\nPresident-elect Bush, you have my word that I will administer the Department of Justice with integrity, I will advise your administration with integrity, and I will enforce the laws of the United States of America with integrity.\nSustaining America as a nation of laws is an ennobling challenge. Janet and I embrace it, and we embrace it absent any slight--even slight reservation.\nThirty-five years ago, Janet and I met at the University of Chicago Law School. Through this semester, she has taught law at Howard University's School of Business in Washington, D.C. She shares my passion for justice and my dedication to upholding the law.\nTogether, we believe that what the prophet Micah observed several thousand years ago: What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God.\nPolitical defeat, as my old colleague and college classmate Joe Lieberman has written, brings more than emotion and pain, it brings perspective. And today, for Janet and me, it brings a renewed and noble call to public service.\nMr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity, this opportunity to serve you and to serve the United States of America. Thank you.\nBUSH: Congratulations.\nASHCROFT: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nQUESTION: I wonder if you could tell us, sir, how the Department of Justice will be different now than it's been under President Clinton?\nBUSH: I can only tell what you it's going to be like in the future and you can draw your own conclusions. John Ashcroft is a man of deep convictions and strong principle. His job will to bring--to enforce the law, that's what his job's going to be, in an impartial way, not in a political way.\nBUSH: And there's going to be a lot of opportunities, obviously, during the transition for me and the vice president or any of my designees to look backwards, but we're not going to do that. Our job is to, once I'm sworn in, and these members of my Cabinet are sworn it, is to look forward, is to think about the future.\nAnd in picking John Ashcroft, I thought long and hard about the future of the Justice Department. It's an incredibly important job. Secondly, I value his advice; I will value his legal advice. Thirdly, one of the things that I am confident is, when he gives me his legal advice, you won't know about it unless I tell you. The reason I say that is, John's a man of enormous integrity. He is going to hold the job for the right reason, and the right reason is serving the country.\nQUESTION: Congratulations, Senator. Good morning, Mr. President-elect.\nWith the economy on everyone's mind, I have a question--two questions, actually. First, will you and your new treasury secretary continue the long-standing strong dollar policy? And secondly, when are you going to announce your White House economic team?\nBUSH: The question was when will I continue to name members of my White House staff, including the economic team. I kind of changed the question a little bit. In due course.\nSecondly, our economic policy will be one that is mindful of the need for this nation to attract foreign capital, capital which will continue to fuel what we all hope will be the entrepreneurial boom that has taken place over the last decade.\nI keep hearing talks about, you know, \"Well, this is an administration that is trying to talk down the economy.\" That's foolish talk. All of us in the Bush administration will want the economy to be strong.\nBut there are some clear warning signs, warning signs that will require what we believe is important action in the halls of Congress, such as tax relief.\nThere are some headlines stories today about consumer confidence in some of the major newspapers in the country. Seems like to me that one of the ways to encourage the consumption and to enhance consumer confidence will be to let people have some of their own money back.\nQUESTION: Sir, you made it a centerpiece of your campaign to reform and upgrade the military, yet it would appear that in an otherwise painless transition, you're still having some problems finding the secretary of defense. I'm wondering, sir, what can you tell us about the problems that you're experiencing. What of Senator Coats, who is said to be a front-runner among congressional Republicans? And what do your deliberations say about your willingness to break with the Republican leadership and conservatives in your party?\nBUSH: I would characterize my search as deliberate. I'm taking my time in a lot of the Cabinet appointments, until I'm absolutely certain that the person I--that the people that I'm talking to is the right person, I'm not going to move. It's so important for us to make sure that we get it right in the beginning.\nAnd so I know there's a lot of speculation. And if it wasn't on the defense position, it might be on another position that I have yet name. But when I make my mind up, people will know that the decision is one made not based upon politics, or who's in favor in some political organization or not, but it's going to be based upon what's right for the country. And I'll let you know when I make up my mind.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect and Senator Ashcroft, the Clinton administration has questioned the fairness of the federal death penalty. Will you consider a moratorium on the federal death penalty?\nQUESTION: And, Senator Ashcroft, as incoming attorney general, is that something that you think should be done?\nBUSH: Well, first let me answer. I look forward to the attorney general-designee's advice, what is his counsel. As I mentioned to you, whatever counsel it is, I hope I don't read about it.\nSecondly, I have, obviously, been the governor of a death penalty state. I support the death penalty when it's administered fairly, justly and surely, because I believe it saves people's lives.\nAnd as I stand here now, David, I see no reason for there to be a moratorium at the federal level. I believe this administration should enforce the laws on the books.\nYou are welcomed to say something, if you would like to. Just don't tell them what your advice is.\n(LAUGHTER)\nASHCROFT: Well, I would say that I have had many of the same experiences that the president-elect has had as governor. And frankly, his views are I think the correct views. And they're obviously his views, but I believe that they are the appropriate views, and I agree completely.\nAnd it's my job, will be my job upon confirmation as attorney general, to support the views of the president and would want to reflect his views in this respect.\nQUESTION: Can I follow-up?\nBUSH: Sure, David.\nQUESTION: Is that to say...\nBUSH: For me or him?\nQUESTION: For you. Is that to say that you don't believe any further view is necessary, as the Clinton administration has, on this particular case, Mr. Garza who is scheduled for execution?\nBUSH: David, the Clinton administration needs to do what it feels like it's got to do. And when I assume office, if there's compelling evidence that the system is not swift and sure and just, I will listen. I will listen.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, to some in the civil rights community, Senator Ashcroft is well-known for blocking the elevation to the federal bench of Ronnie White, a Supreme Court justice in Missouri. Some criticize that and thought there was some racial motivation behind that. I would like you to address that controversy, sir. And also tell us the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will do under his leadership, different from what Bill Lann Lee has done, who was very much criticized by Republicans in the Senate, including Mr. Ashcroft.\nBUSH: I looked at John's record in all matters, including the case that you--to which you refer. John can answer that question in specific, if you'd like. But there's no question in my mind that he will uphold and enforce the law, the civil rights laws on the books of America. He has had a very good record of reaching out to people from all walks of life. He was a governor who appointed African-Americans to the bench. He's a man who has got a good and decent heart.\nAnd he had his reasons of blocking a single nomination. And I thought about that, and I looked at the facts, and I listened to him. And there's no question in my mind that this is a person who believes in civil rights for all citizens.\nQUESTION: Good morning, Mr. President-elect. Congratulations, Senator.\nEight years ago, President-elect Bill Clinton talked about having one of the most ethical administrations in American history. During the course of this campaign, you have both criticized the Department of Justice and Janet Reno, as well as the White House. Could you give us an example or describe for us each the type of integrity and ethics that the two of you bring to the White House as a contrast to what has just ended or is about to?\nBUSH: During the course of the transition, I'm sure there's going to be ample opportunity to be critical of the administration, which I'm not going to do. It is now time to move forward. That's what the election was all about. It is time, we've had our debates, we've had our discussions, and this administration is going to move forward.\nSTAFF: Last question.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, if I could take you back to the economy for just a moment. You've expressed some concern about the signs of slowdown here. You haven't talked that much about the slowdown around the world. Japan seems to be slipping back into recession. Europe has been in some trouble.\nQUESTION: Can you tell us a little bit about how your plans would involve not only regenerating the U.S. economy, but also any concerns you may have about how you get the rest of the world economy going and whether it could pull us down?\nBUSH: Well, I am mindful that each country's going to have to make their own decisions, economic decisions, as to how best to invigorate growth.\nFirst, we should lead by example, and the example of less regulation, rule of law, capital formation, encouragement of entrepreneurial growth, is an important example for stagnant economies to look at.\nSecondly, I'm going to promote free trade. I think free trade will be a stimulus for economic activity all around the world.\nThirdly, we will have a foreign policy that is humble. We will have a foreign policy that is present, but humble. And by that I mean that we should not be divining prescriptions for people's ills. If they want to work with us, fine. But our country cannot try to impose our prescriptions on nations.\nFourthly, I'm absolutely aware of the connection between foreign markets and U.S. economic growth. That's why I answered Patsy's question the way I did. I'm mindful of the need of this country to be a place where people can get a good return on their investment in order to attract capital. And obviously, therefore, I am concerned about the lack of available capital coming from foreign countries.\nBut ours will be an administration of free trade, less regulations that affect the flow of capital around the world, and one based upon humility, as well as the confidence in free markets and the entrepreneurial spirit.\nThank you all very much. See you this afternoon. Then we'll have the traditional holiday greeting.", "timestamp": "2000-12-22", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference Announcing the Nomination of Senator John Ashcroft as Attorney General"}

There'll be a meeting on January the 18th, and that'll be the moment at which I hope Governor Gilmore is elected, receives the votes necessary to lead our party.\nJim Gilmore has done a fantastic job as the governor of Virginia. He is a man who stands on principle and is able to make a principled case to people from all walks of life. He's a fellow who knows what it means to set an agenda, build consensus to achieve an agenda, and lead. And he's going to make a really good chairman of our party.\nJim not only is a politically savvy person, he also has been really good on different policy matters. He's led some interesting task forces for different governors' groups, for example. And I really appreciate the way he conducts his business, and America will as well.\nAnd we have an opportunity in our party to reach out to people from all walks of life, and we're going to do that. And I can't think of a better person to do it than my buddy and hopefully the next chairman of the Republican Party, Jim Gilmore.\nChairman Nicholson will say a few words and then Governor Gilmore will, then we answer one or two questions for you.\nNICHOLSON: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nI'm real proud to be here today. After two terms as chairman of the Republican National Committee, often strenuous, often challenging, sometimes frustrating, but always important, and I wouldn't have traded the experience for anything.\nI came to Washington four years ago like a soldier on a mission. I wanted to restore the party's economic health after a difficult struggle. I wanted to help reunify the Republican Party, and, most importantly, do everything I could to see that we put a Republican president in the White House after the 2000 elections and give him a Republican Congress and to add to our majorities in the state legislatures.\nAnd I'm proud to say, sir, mission accomplished.\n(LAUGHTER)\nNext month, President-elect Bush and Vice President-elect Cheney will go to the White House. These are the leaders that the Republicans and all Americans have been waiting for. Their integrity, their vision, their compassionate conservatism will renew America, will bring Americans together again as a nation. It will move us forward in a future more glorious than we can imagine.\nThey will continue the work of other great Republican presidents. It brings to mind the words of Ronald Reagan, who said, \"They will preserve all that's best in America and improve the rest.\"\nIn addition, I'm very gratified to be turning over the keys to the Republican National Committee to a man that I trust and admire and who has become a good friend. In fact, he's the first guy to ever ask me for money after I got elected chairman of the RNC...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... about 36 hours later at a coffee pot in Washington, when he told me he was going to be the next governor of Virginia and would I help him.\nAnd help him I did. In fact, I went to the bank and borrowed some money to help Jim Gilmore in his campaign, and he's done a fantastic job since as the governor of Virginia in helping to organize and realign the state of Virginia for the Republican Party.\nSo I am very, very happy to be turning over to him a party that is in very good shape financially, is in great shape spiritually, we're united and full of positive vision for the future for our country.\nSo let me close by again thanking you, President-elect Bush, and Vice President-elect Cheney. I want to thank my wife Suzanne--who's here with me today, who's been at my side the whole time, the entire four years that we have been in this endeavor--and all supporters, everywhere throughout America, who have supported this party so generously the last four years to enable us to do what we have done. Nothing could have been a better experience than this. Thank you.\nAnd now I'd like to ask President-elect Bush if he would introduce to you the man who'll be my successor, I'm sure, because the Republican National Committee will have the wisdom to elect him. Thank you.\nBUSH: Well, I bragged about him once, I better stop before it goes to his head.\nBut, Governor, thanks for taking on the assignment. Congratulations. You'll do a great job.\nGILMORE: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nLadies and gentlemen, I want to tell you how glad I am to be here and to have the support of the president-elect, who has asked me to take on the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee. This is a wonderful opportunity for national service. It's a chance for me to keep my faith with the people of Virginia while I'm governor, and, at the same time, serve this administration and serve the party and serve the United States as chairman of the Republican National Committee.\nAnd, Mr. President-elect, I appreciate very much your confidence and your friendship we have always had together.\nThe first lady of Virginia has come to Texas with me, my wife, Roxanne. I'm delighted that she's here to stand with me as she always has in new endeavors.\nI want to just take a moment and thank Mr. Chairman, Jim Nicholson, and his lovely wife, Suzanne, who's here. We have become good friends of the Nicholsons' over the last number of years, ever since I asked him for that money. We have become very good friends.\nNICHOLSON: I gave it to him.\nGILMORE: He gave it to me. And it made all the difference in the world, and that is exactly what the RNC's opportunity is--to help people who want to do good things for the people of the United States.\nI want to thank Pat Harrison, the vice chairwoman of the RNC. Pat has just done a wonderful job.\nAnd between the leadership of Pat and chairman, what achievements have we had. We have gained more donors to the Republican Party than ever before, by hundreds of thousands. More ads and information was given to the people of the United States in this past campaign than ever before in the history of the nation. More people were working in the grassroots and involved out there, talking to their friends and neighbors, than ever before in history.\nAnd, Jim, I just want you to know I know this is a hard act to follow, and I appreciate the service that you have given to the party and, thereby, to the country.\nIt's of course an opportunity to lead this party. The president-elect has shared with me, over a long period of time now, his desire to see the party broaden, to broaden its base, and to bring additional people in. He has led by example in this regard here in the state of Texas. He's made it clear that this is the goal that he wishes that the party to achieve, to bring more people in from the Hispanic community, the African-American community, all regions of the United States of America, and to make this party broader even than it is now.", "timestamp": "2000-12-22", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect Naming Jim Gilmore as Chairman of the Republican National Committee"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84901", "text": "BUSH: Good afternoon.\nThis afternoon it's my honor to nominate to serve as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency my friend, fellow governor, Governor Christie Todd Whitman of the state of New Jersey.\nGovernor Whitman has had a really good record as the governor of that state. She has been able to balance the demands for economic growth and at the same time she's supported environmental protection measures.\nShe has set and enforced firm and clear standards for the protection of New Jersey's environment and the New Jersey shoreline. She led the way in securing funding to purchase a million acres of land for open space. All this while overseeing the reemergence of her state as a place where people can find work, a center of economic activity and development.\nGovernor Whitman reflects a growing consensus in this country about environmental policy.\nShe and I share the same point of view. We share a philosophy that moves beyond the old central command-and-control mindset that believes Washington has got all the answers to environmental issues. My administration will work with state and local governments in protecting our land and air and water. In partnership and in mutual respect, we will meet our common obligations as citizens and stewards of our Earth.\nI know Governor Whitman well. She is a strong person. She is plenty capable of taking on this difficult, but important, assignment. I am asking Governor Whitman to join my administration. I also--I told her how much I will value her advice, to the point at which I'm going to name her position as a Cabinet officer.\nAnd so it is my honor, along with the vice president-to-be's honor, to submit the name of Christie Todd Whitman to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nWHITMAN: Mr. President, I am honored to be asked to serve as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nI thank you for your confidence. And I also want to thank my family, whose unwavering support has allowed me to accept challenge after challenge, and this job will be a challenge. I recognize that.\nTeddy Roosevelt, our first conservationist president, once said, \"I recognize the right and the duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land, but I do not recognize the right to waste them for the generations that come after us.\"\nTR understood the necessity of striking the right balance between competing interests for the good of all Americans. Our new president understands that as well. It's been a hallmark of his leadership in Texas, and I know it will be a hallmark of his leadership for America.\nSuch leadership is important in everything that government does, and that's especially true in the work that we do to protect our environment.\nFor the past seven years, I have what I believe to have been the best job in America, governor of New Jersey. I also believe that my job has given me the best preparation for this new opportunity, an opportunity that I embrace with great enthusiasm and great expectation.\nNew Jersey has been challenged. We've had to meet all the environmental concerns. We know the challenges of reclaiming abandoned industrial sites. We know the need to protect our cities, their quality of water, their quality of life, to ensure that our suburbs and rural areas aren't overrun by suburban sprawl.\nWe also face the responsibility of being good stewards to 127 miles of beaches, thousands of acres of forest and woodlands, and a farming tradition that we cherish. All of this in the context of a dynamic and growing state economy.\nHaving served as governor, I also know what it's like to be on the receiving end of mandates from Washington. I have never underestimated the importance of environmental protection, just as I have never overestimated the ease in achieving it. That perspective will help me work with our states as we meet the challenges ahead of us.\nFinally, I come to this job as someone who grew up on and still lives on a family farm. In my earliest years, I developed a respect for the balance that nature brings to the land. I also learned the importance that everyone on the farm pitches in to do their share and then some.\nThat's why I am honored to be given this position in a Bush administration, where I intend to do my share and then some to meet the challenge. I know that this great country of ours has the ability and the will to build a more prosperous America, while meeting our environmental obligations to those who follow us.\nMr. President, thank you again very much for this opportunity.\nBUSH: Congratulations. Great job.\nWHITMAN: Thank you.\nBUSH: And it gives me great joy now to wish everybody a happy holiday season. I hope you're safe in your travels as you go home.\nI look forward to seeing your smiling countenances after the season. And as a gift, I will spare you from having to ask me any questions.\n(LAUGHTER)\nGod bless.", "timestamp": "2000-12-22", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect Announcing the Nomination of Christie Todd Whitman as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency"}
{"author": "Richard B. Cheney", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84904", "text": "VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT CHENEY: Good morning.\nWell, I'm delighted to be here this morning and have an opportunity to pay a courtesy call and pay my respects to Senator Joe Lieberman. We've been able to work together in the past. I think back to the days of the Gulf War when Joe was a new member of the Senate and one of the strong supporters of the policies that we pursued then.\nAnd the campaign this year, of course, was very hard-fought on both sides, ended in a way I don't think either one of us expected, but I enjoyed and am proud to have been his competitor and delighted to be here this morning to have a few minutes to talk with him and share some thoughts and ideas on areas that we may be able to work together on in the future, and to wish he and Hadassah the very best for the holidays.\nSEN. LIEBERMAN: Thank you. Thanks, Dick.\nIt was my pleasure to welcome Secretary Cheney. We have worked together in the past. We were opponents this year but certainly on my part, and I know both of us, very respectful opponents of one another. The conversation was a very warm and cordial conversation.\nI appreciate Dick Cheney's offer to come and visit this morning.\nWe talked about areas in which we can work together. I think we both agree that we have some opportunities for bipartisan agreements that can create the kind of results that people in this country expect of us, and that we should, together, take every opportunity we can to achieve those results.\nSo I wish you a good holiday. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, all the best.\nI've had the pleasure, actually, of working with Lynne Cheney on some stuff, too, and maybe we can even find ways for that to continue.\nQUESTION: Senator...\nLIEBERMAN: Question?\nQUESTION: ... you talk of appointments? Any talk of potential problems with appointments?\nLIEBERMAN: You mean for me?\n(CROSSTALK)\nLIEBERMAN: I was just going to say--I was going to make clear that the position that I aspire to in the administration seems to have been filled.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: Is there any potential problem with nominees?\nCHENEY: Well, we are, of course, in the process of nominating members of the Cabinet. One of the things we take into account as we go through that process is try to assess whether or not there will be any confirmation problems. So far, we don't anticipate any.\nBut we get to nominate, and the Senate gets to confirm. And I'm sure the Senate will do its thing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cheney, the White House says the Bush team is deliberatively talking down the economy for political gain. Do you believe that you're being unduly pessimistic about the state of the U.S. economy?\nCHENEY: No, we've tried to be very precise and accurate in our statements. We don't want to talk down the economy, clearly. And I think both President-elect Bush and myself have tried to be cautious in that regard.\nBut there does seem to be a lot evidence out there--it's not just something that we're seeing--but a lot of evidence that, in fact, the economy has slowed down some. It was growing at a fairly rapid rate, on the order of 5 percent or better, and it's slowed.\nAnd the evidence is there in a number of areas. Whether you're talking about automobiles or rail car loading, there are various sectors of the economy that clearly are not growing at the rate they were growing earlier.\nWhether or not this ultimately results in a recession--that is, negative real growth--nobody knows at this time.\nI think our views are very similar to those that have been expressed by Chairman Greenspan. And we have an obligation as we get ready to take responsibility to make certain that we've got an accurate sense of where the economy is. That's one of the reasons one of the first meetings we had this week was with Chairman Greenspan and that we are prepared to do whatever is required to maintain our long-term growth and prosperity as a nation.\nQUESTION: What areas did you find, or do you think you can work together on?\nLIEBERMAN: Look, as a general principle, I'd say that it's in the nature of the relationship I have with Dick Cheney, and I hope the relationship that Democrats in Congress have with this administration, that where we can find common ground, we should do so, and that's what people sent us here for.\nMaybe the closeness of the election at all levels, not just presidential, but congressional as well, will shake all of us to the extent that we do what the people of America always tell us they want us to do, which is work together to get something done.\nAnd there will be areas of disagreement, but I think it's equally important to make sure that on those areas of disagreement, we disagree with mutual respect and civility. And I was very proud of the debate that Secretary Cheney and I had during the campaign, because I think we managed to do just that in just that way.\nTwo areas we spoke about were education reform and national security. As you know, together with Senator Evan Bayh and nine or 10 other moderate Democrats in the Senate, I introduced an education reform bill earlier last year. It is in some regards quite like the Bush-Cheney proposal; in other regards it's not.\nBut I think there's a real basis there for trying to achieve an early bipartisan agreement, which, incidentally, is not only a good idea but our responsibility because the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ran out last year and we really should authorize it this year.\nOn national defense, Dick Cheney and I worked closest together during the period before, during and after the Gulf War.\nAnd I think we have a lot of areas of overlap of agreement and priorities in the central importance of keeping our national defense strong and of modernizing our forces. So I hope--they're are two big areas that matter, I think, a lot to our country and to our people, where, if we use heads and common sense, we ought to achieve bipartisan progress.\nQUESTION: Where did you all disagree?\nCHENEY: I can't think of a single area. Can you, Joe?\nLIEBERMAN: Only on the outcome of the election in Florida.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: Did you talk about that?\nLIEBERMAN: No. No, we didn't.\nWe actually did. We stressed the positive, too. We really did.\nQUESTION: Senator Lieberman, are you comfortable with some of the names you're hearing quoted for Secretary of Defense? Specifically Senator Coats?\nLIEBERMAN: Now, I don't know if my endorsement will hurt or help any of the candidates that are mentioned today.\nDan Coats and I, to respond to your question, happen to be very good personal friends, and we served together on the Armed Services Committee of the Senate. And we worked very closely and hard together on what I think he and I both think is the central challenge facing the Defense Department today, which is defense transformation, modernization of our forces to face the new kinds of threats that we'll face in the future.\nI don't agree with Dan Coats on everything. We have pretty big disagreements on some issues, but on the central--on the most important issue for our defense as I see it--which is defense transformation, keeping us strong in the world, applying technology to our national security--I think Dan Coats would be a superb choice.\nSo again, I hope I don't hurt his chances by saying that, but you asked.\nQUESTION: Can I ask either one of you, in your discussion on education, did you talk about vouchers?\nCHENEY: The subject came up. This was not a session where we were trying to persuade each other of what to be in a bill; simply comparing notes that there are major areas of agreement and that we both thought this was an area where the new administration could work with the Congress to try to make some progress.\nQUESTION: Senator Lieberman, are you now for or against vouchers?\nLIEBERMAN: Well, you know, I supported demonstration programs for vouchers, and I still think those are a good idea, but this was a very brief part of our discussion about education.\nI did say to Secretary Cheney that when it came time to putting together the education reform proposal that Senator Bayh and the other moderate Democrats and I in the Senate put together earlier this year, we did not have a voucher proposal in it because we felt it would make the overall proposal a nonstarter, it wouldn't go because the vouchers are such a controversial idea here.\nYou know, I haven't counted heads or anything, but my guess is that that is still true and that's something we'll have to work out.\nI think there are other ways that we try to include in our bill that bring some of the features that vouchers do, which is to give parents more choice, to create competition within the school systems and you can do that with charter schools, you can do it with public school choice programs, you can do it with standards of accountability. And these are all areas, incidentally, the ones I've mentioned, in which there is a fair amount of overlap or similarity between the Bush-Cheney education proposal and the one that the Senate moderate Democrats put forward, which we called our three Rs bill.\nQUESTION: Senator Cheney, we all expect that you'll be here more frequently than any other vice presidents to break ties in the Senate. You also seem to be, though, sort of the point-man here on the Hill for the administration. I just wondered if you care to comment on how you see your role in working with the Congress?\nCHENEY: I clearly have an obligation, obviously, as an officer of the Senate--the president of the Senate, which is the responsibilities that traditionally go with the role of being vice president. It wasn't that many years ago that's all you did as vice president. And I don't even think the vice president had offices downtown until maybe the, certainly, the post-war period.\nIn addition to that, President-elect Bush has asked to me take on special responsibilities with respect to the Congress, to be prepared to work both for the Senate and the House, in terms of working on legislation and legislative proposals. So I would expect to spend a fair amount of time up here.\nAnd I enjoy it. I spent 10 years in the House of Representatives. I think it's a useful endeavor for me, and one that I should be able to make something of a contribution in.\nI'm going to have to bail out, but I wanted to thank everybody for being here today. And, again, I want to thank Joe Lieberman for his hospitality and look forward very much to working with him in the future.\nLIEBERMAN: So do I.\nCHENEY: Joe, thanks.\nLIEBERMAN: Good to see you. I wish you the best.\nCHENEY: All right.\nLIEBERMAN: Thank you all.", "timestamp": "2000-12-21", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President-Elect with Senator Joseph Lieberman"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84888", "text": "BUSH: Today I have the opportunity to name three outstanding Americans to three very important Cabinet positions.\nWhen I campaigned in Iowa, I told many of the folks involved in the agricultural community there that I would name a secretary of agriculture who understood the importance of agriculture in the larger scheme of things for America, that agriculture not only is an incredibly important part of our economy, agriculture is an important part of our international policy as well, that agriculture represents an incredibly important way of life, that the values of the farm are ingrained in the American soul.\nAnd I found the right person who shares that philosophy. Ann Veneman has been in government before.\nShe was deputy secretary at the Agricultural Department, so she has experience in that office in Washington. She was also the secretary of California's Department of Food and Agriculture. She was the first woman to hold that post, and now she'll be the first woman to hold the post at the USDA.\nShe's an accomplished attorney, she's bright, she's capable and she'll do an outstanding job.\nI also have picked a secretary for Housing and Human Development, Mel Martinez from the state of Florida. Mel is the executive of Orange County, which is a sizable county in central Florida, and he's done a really good job. He's an administrator. He's a good executive. He also is a good lawyer. In spite of that, I named him to the position.\nHe's got a wonderful story. He was a refugee, as a young boy, from Cuba. He understands American values; he's grown to appreciate them. And there's no greater American value than owning something; owning your own home and having the opportunity to do so. Mel is the perfect pick to run this important department, and I'm honored that he would agree to serve.\nAnd finally, I'm going to name a new--obviously, name a new one--but I'm naming a secretary of commerce named Don Evans. Evans has been my life-long friend. He has been the chairman of my campaign. He has been a valuable adviser. He is a free enterpriser. He understands free trade. And he'll do a fabulous job as the secretary of commerce.\nI will continue to name members of my Cabinet as this week progresses. Will do so between the holidays, Christmas and the New Year's, as well.\nToday I've named three outstanding Americans. I would like all three to have a few comments to you, starting with the secretary-designee of the Department of Agriculture, Ann Veneman.\nVENEMAN: Thank you very much.\nMr. President-elect, I am honored and humbled to be asked to join your administration and to serve with you and your highly qualified team.\nIt says a good deal about your commitment to agriculture that one of your first appointments is that of secretary of agriculture.\nAgriculture is part of the fabric that makes America great. Our farmers feed and clothe not only the people in this country but people around the world. And it's important that we work together to expand markets for our food and fiber both at home and abroad.\nPresident-elect Bush, like you, I want to find common ground and promote common sense. And I want to promote policies that will help all of our farmers reap a bountiful harvest for years to come.\nThank you again for placing your confidence in me. Thanks very much.\nBUSH: Good job.\nMel?\nMARTINEZ: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nIn my city eight years ago, as a 15-year-old refugee, I arrived on the shores of America. And I had no family. I was alone. I did not speak the language.\nI had only a dream to live in freedom. And after living for four years with wonderful people in foster homes where I learned the goodness of America and its people, I was reunited with my family here in freedom.\nToday, that immigrant, that refugee, that young man looking for freedom is standing before you, receiving the nomination of the next president to serve in his Cabinet.\nAnd, Mr. President-elect, I am proud to receive your nomination and I accept it.\nToday, for me, is a fulfillment of the promise of America; the promise that regardless where you come from, what language you speak, the color of your skin, or your economic circumstances, if you share the dream of a brighter tomorrow and you're willing to pursue it with respect for others and an abiding faith in God, all things are possible.\nAs secretary of housing and urban development, I will continue to carry that dream of freedom with me. After all, the dream of freedom is the American dream.\nPresident-elect Bush, as you know, for too long, too many Americans have been left out of the American dream. And as you said last spring, home ownership lies at the very heart of the American dream. I agree with you. And I will work hard to ensure that every American has every opportunity to have affordable housing.\nThis is a vital element of compassionate conservatism.\nI know you will help low-income Americans achieve the full promise of America. After all, that is the American dream.\nIt is my blessing that the dream has come true for me, and now it is my responsibility to help it come true for others.\nThank you.\nEVANS: Let me begin by saying thank you to an old friend who's offered me a new challenge.\nMr. President-elect, I'm both honored and I'm humbled. I proudly accept this challenge, and if confirmed will humbly dedicate my best efforts to uphold your high standards.\nAt this moment I'd also like to give thanks to my family, who has supported me through the years and given me advice. In fact, I got advice from my wife this afternoon before coming here, telling me to remember where I came from, and I will.\nYes, I am ready to serve this great nation. And since our founding, we have been a nation of free men and free markets. You see it everywhere in America from the corner merchants in Washington, D.C., to the oil fields of west Texas. Our business in America is truly business, and as a result, our economy is the envy of the world.\nBut as President-elect Bush has suggested, the delights of today tell us little about tomorrow. Now is no time for small plans or shrinking ambitions.\nGoverning, like business, is about setting a course, setting priorities, setting goals and objectives and making the right choices for the right reasons. And if I'm fortunate enough to be confirmed by the Senate, the road the Department of Commerce will travel is clear: The promotion of free enterprise, first in America and then abroad, will be our first priority; free flow of capital; free and open competition.\nAnd we will strive to be an advocate for U.S. businesses first in America and also those wading into the waters of the global marketplace.\nIn short, we will endeavor to keep the genius of the American free enterprise system strong and dynamic from sea to shining sea and around the world.\nI know there are many more responsibilities of the Department of Commerce, and we will be good shepherds and stewards of those responsibilities. But first and foremost, we will be thinking about the great free enterprise system of America.\nIt is an exciting challenge. And after almost 25 years in the energy industry, the chance to bring the experience of the private sector to the exercise of public service is a welcomed one.\nSo, Mr. President-elect, I stand before you ready, sustained by my faith, humbled by this opportunity and prepared to serve.\nThank you very much and God bless you.\nBUSH: Thank you all.", "timestamp": "2000-12-20", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference Announcing the Nomination of Ann Veneman as Secretary of Agriculture, Mel Martinez as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Donald Evans as Secretary of Commerce"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84897", "text": "BUSH: Thank you all for coming. Today I have an important announcement to make.\nThere is a reason why the Treasury Department is right next to the White House. It's because the secretary of treasury and the president must work closely for the good of the American people. The secretary of treasury is the chief financial officer of our nation, the successor to Alexander Hamilton.\nThis job is obviously always important for any administration, but I think it's incredibly important as we head into the 21st century. The world is more connected than ever. Our economy and the lives of every American depend upon our standing in the world.\nSecondly, our economy is showing warning signs of a possible slowdown. And so it is incredibly important for me to find somebody who had vast experience, who is a steady hand, who when he speaks, speaks with authority and conviction and knowledge.\nI found such a man in Paul O'Neill. Paul O'Neill has strong credentials in government and in business. He worked at the Office of Management and Budget and had a distinguished record.\nBUSH: People who knew Paul in that capacity knew him to be a straight shooter and innovator, someone who could lead. Paul has got vast experience in the private sector. He has run large corporations, and even more importantly, has employed large numbers of people. He knows that all our decisions, and one of the key goals of this administration, will be to make sure that all Americans can find high-paying, high-quality jobs.\nPaul has extensive knowledge about the world and the international economy. After all, in his current job, he employs over 140,000 people in 36 countries. He's worked broadly in the field of education. We share a vision of making sure that we have an educated work force as we head into the 21st century.\nIn the days ahead, there will be much to do together. We must work to keep our economy strong.\nBUSH: That's why we share a commitment to fair and responsible tax relief, and a strong commitment to making sure there is free trade in our world.\nI look forward to having this good man by my side. I look forward to having him making our administration's case to the Congress, to the American people and to the world. Therefore, it is a great honor for me to submit to the United States Senate the name of Paul O'Neill as secretary of treasury.\nO'NEILL: Thank you, President-elect Bush. I am truly honored to be asked to do this important job.\nI must tell you in all candor that until three weeks ago I thought I was immune to the suggestion that I should return to public life, having been there before for 16 years. But perhaps it's a mark of the capability of the president-elect in convincing people to do things that he wants them to do that I'm here today to say, yes, I'm going to do this job.\nO'NEILL: I believe in the president-elect's policy and program, as he's articulated it over the last many months. And I'm dedicated to helping him achieve the greatness that I believe he aspires to for America.\nSo it's really a pleasure for me to be here today. Some of you have noted in your stories, Secretary Cheney and I go back many years, and so it's also a pleasure to have a prospect of working closely with him again.\nThank you very much.\nBUSH: Be glad to take some questions. Karen?\nQUESTION: Do you think it would be beneficial or detrimental for President Clinton to visit North Korea before he leaves office?\nBUSH: The question was about potential travels for the current president. There's only one president in our country, and that's President Clinton. And he must make the decisions for what's best for our nation.\nIt's up to the president and his advisers to decide what's best for America. And until I'm the president, he is going to make those decisions.\nQUESTION: The Federal Reserve is now saying that there's a significant risk of an economic downturn. Do you worry that you're inheriting a recession? And beyond tax cuts, how would you deal with this?\nBUSH: The question was about the Fed's recent actions that signal that we may have some economic problems ahead for our administration. I said during the course of my campaign, and I believe strongly, that tax relief is part of the prescription for any economic ill that our nation may have. I think it is so important for members of the Hill to understand that tax relief is all about economic growth and cash flow and accumulation of capital, and so is Social Security reform.\nPart of the reforms we outlined in the campaign on Social Security, as you may remember, talked about personal savings account. That not only encourages people to manage their own money, trust people with their own money, that policy encourages the accumulation of capital in the private sector. Capital is what fuels entrepreneurial growth.\nSecondly, our nation must be bold enough to be a nation that's willing to trade freely in the world. One of the cornerstones of our foreign policy must be trade. Not only trade in our own hemisphere, which I think is incredibly important for the United States, but also for Mexico and countries to the south. Free trade in our hemisphere is incredibly important for Canada. But we must be a nation of free traders.\nBUSH: Thirdly, we must review regulations that hamper the accumulation of capital, regulations that make it harder for the entrepreneur to start a business.\nAnd fourthly, we must have a steady voice coming out of our administration, someone, should the economy take a downturn, who can calm people's nerves, calm the markets, calm those who would speculate on the dollar. And that's why I'm naming Paul O'Neill as the secretary of treasury. Such an important, important decision, because he is a man that's capable of doing that job.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, sir, are you concerned that by talking down the economy, you run the risk of making the possibility of a downturn even more real, sir?\nBUSH: My job as the chief executive officer-soon-to-be is to anticipate. I am hopeful that this economy stays strong. I'm hopeful that the rate of growth of the economy is such that more capital will flow into the private sector, that people will be able to find jobs, that retail sales will be strong, that the automobile industry will be robust.\nBUSH: I'm hopeful that the downturn in the Nasdaq is a correction, because I understand the productivity gains that we'll have in our economy as a result of the new technologies.\nI'm hopeful, but I'm also a realist, and one of my jobs is to think ahead just in case.\nThe Fed sent the signal, and we are going to play the hand we have been dealt. I want everybody to understand loud and clear that our hope in this administration is our economy remain robust. But should it not, we have a plan, the cornerstone of which will be tax relief, free trade, Social Security reform, less regulations.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, during the campaign you also spoke about the need for a sweeping energy policy. Can you tell us something specific that you would do, for instance, in the first 100 days to correct rising energy prices?\nBUSH: I strongly believe that we must work in concert to increase the amount of supply available for American consumers--supply of natural gas, supply of coal, supply of plant and equipment.\nI believe we need to review all federal land policy, to make sure that we're not missing an opportunity to explore for natural gas in the country.\nNatural gas is hemispheric. I like to call it hemispheric in nature, because it is a product that we can find in our own neighborhoods and is immune from price manipulation by OPEC. There are supplies of gas to be discovered in America.\nThe issue with natural gas is not only its discovery, but its transportation, so we must review all policies that would prevent the construction of pipeline, to be able to move gas from field to market.\nWhen we're undersupplied as a nation and demand increases, prices will go up. And that's what happening in the energy field.\nI look forward to working with Congress to pass clean coal technologies, money for clean coal technology, so that we can explore and develop the vast coal reserves in our country, with the comfort of knowing that we're not going to ruin our environment.\nI look forward to working with our friends and allies in our own hemisphere to put together a hemispheric energy policy, an energy policy that will allow for the free flow of natural gas, in particular across our respective borders, to make sure there is ample supply, ample supply, to meet the demand of this nation.\nAnd so, Karl, I look forward to, when I'm swearing in, is to put together a strategy that'll make clear to the American people that we will address the needs.\nQUESTION: How serious do you think the energy situation is? Would you call it, as your spokesman did, a looming crisis? And some of the steps you just outlined sound more long term than short term. What can your prospective administration do to help consumers in the short term?\nBUSH: Well, obviously, we can work with Congress to fund LIHEAP, to help poor consumers that are having trouble paying their energy bills. I look forward to doing that. I think there's going to be bipartisan support for such a measure. After all, it's been funded in the past, and I'm confident we can get that done.\nI think there are some ways to expeditiously move natural gas to the market in a way that protects the environment, exploration in some of our Western states, for example.\nBut there's no question that we're going to have to work with our friends and allies overseas, particularly with the price of crude oil and heating oil, to make sure they understand that they've got to treat their friend, the United States, and our market with ease. They can't be punishing our friend.\nAnd one of the things we're going to have to do is to start up a strong diplomatic effort to work with, as I say, our friends in the Middle East, to have an energy policy there that is respectful to their friend here and other democracies.\nBUSH: The shortest--the quickest impact on the price of energy price, particularly crude oil, will be to work with OPEC nations and to foster relations so that they may be convinced to open up the spigots to keep the pressure off price.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, regarding your meeting later today with African-American ministers, what do you believe you can do specifically to improve your standing among African-Americans?\nBUSH: Well, David, first, our meeting this afternoon is with ministers from all walks of life--different religions, different race. This is not a political meeting. This is a meeting to begin a dialogue about how best to help faith-based programs change people's lives, how best government can encourage as opposed to discourage faith-based programs from performing their commonplace miracles of renewal.\nMy hope is that when people who may not have supported me get to know me they realize that I am just as intent upon being a good president for them as for those folks who supported me.\nMy hope is that when people get to know our policies, whether it be making sure that the education system is responsive not only to the children of the parents who voted for me, but responsive to children from all walks of life, that they will realize that our commitment is to an America where the dream shines brightly for everybody.\nBUSH: My hope, my hope is that when people get to know me as a person I'll be able to sit down and say, \"We may disagree on a particular piece of public policy, but we don't disagree on an America that is hopeful and strong and vibrant for every child.\"\nI've got a lot of work to do, Dave, I understand that. I got a lot of work to do. But you know what? I welcome the opportunity. I look forward to the chance.\nI look forward to the chance of healing a nation that has been divided as a result of an election. I look forward to the chance of saying to people, regardless of their political persuasion, that ours will be an administration that focuses on what's right for America, not what's right for a particular party, but what's right for the great country that we all love. And I accept the challenge and I recognize it's there.\nQUESTION: You've mentioned Social Security several times. Two questions: How do you persuade Americans at a time when we may be going into a slow down that they want to put their retirement money into private accounts, perhaps in the stock market?\nBUSH: Right.\nQUESTION: And secondly, are you still planning to form a commission on this as the first step to bringing consensus on it?\nBUSH: I said I'd do so in the campaign, form a commission for Social Security. I'm going to look at to make sure it's the right policy. I think it is. And we'll let you know.\nSecondly, an investment in the private markets should be viewed as a long-term hold, not something--the mentality of the day-trader is not a part of the vision of a retirement system where people are able to hold assets for a long period of time.\nThere will be ups and downs in the marketplace. But the facts are that the rate of return on moneys held in the private markets are significantly higher than that which is achieved off of the Social Security trust.\nAnd in order to make sure that baby boomers who are going to retire within the decade and beyond have got retirement system, we've got to do a better job of getting a rate of return on the moneys in the Social Security trust.\nSecondly, one of the key challenges for our nation is to make sure that there is enough money in the private markets to fuel economic growth in the future. And a Social Security system that allows people to manage their own money in private markets will provide the fuel for economic vitality in the future.\nAnd I believe the American people heard this argument.\nBUSH: I want to remind you that my opponent also talked about some kind of private savings accounts; we just disagreed on the funding mechanism. I think the private savings accounts ought to come from the payroll taxes people contribute into the Social Security trust. And this is an important issue that I'm going to prioritize right after I'm elected.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, there was speculation that you may be looking towards Wall Street to make the treasury secretary pick. How concerned were you about Wall Street's reaction?\nAnd also, Mr. O'Neill is known to believe in low interest rates. Are you expecting any sort of conflict with the chairman of the Federal Reserve over interest rates?\nBUSH: I might let him ask the question--answer the question about his relationship with the Fed. I will tell you--well, I'll put some word in his mouth. He understands, like I understand, that the Fed makes decision independent of the president and the secretary of treasury.\nOn the other hand, we will have a good working relationship with Alan Greenspan. He is a very capable American who has made a huge difference for our country.\nAnd first part of the--oh, Wall Street. Well, I think people on Wall Street who are savvy will understand what a good pick Paul O'Neill is.\nBUSH: And I am--I looked at a lot of folks, people with different backgrounds and different addresses, and I found the absolutely right person for the job.\nPaul, you may want to comment, and then we've got to go eat lunch.\nO'NEILL: Thank you.\nYou know, I'm really mindful of something that is clear to me today, and, frankly, it's the difference between being a free-ranging, self-admitted maverick who would give you a 15 or 20 minute brief on almost anything you'd like to ask about. That was yesterday.\nAnd I understand perfectly well that Fed policy is up to the Federal Reserve chairman.\nBut maybe as a little background, it would be useful for you to know that I've known and worked with Alan Greenspan since 1969 when I was rising through the ranks to become deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Alan was there for part of the time as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. And we became not just professional associates, but close friends.\nAnd you know from the background material, when I left the government, I went to International Paper and eventually became president of International Paper Company, but I kept up my association with Alan over the years.\nO'NEILL: And in 1987 Alan was a member of the board of directors of what was then the Aluminum Company of America, now Alcoa. And Alan and two or three other outside directors decided that I should join Alcoa as chairman and CEO, so we go back a long way. We've had lots of dealings with each other over the years that I've been at Alcoa and he's been at the Fed.\nI've made it my business, at his request, to come by on a fairly regular basis and tell him what I thought he was doing wrong and what I thought he was doing right, which I felt I had the privilege to do being longtime friends and associates.\nAnd what he said to me was, it was valuable to him because he didn't have an opportunity to meet with many people who didn't want something, and so he valued me coming by and sharing with him my perception of what economic affairs were doing in places as far flung as China and Russia and Hungary and Spain and Italy and all the other places that Alcoa has business around the world.\nAnd so I guess I would change your question that said outloud that I favor low interest rates to say that I am here substantially because I believe the president-elect. I have the right ideas about where our economy should go. It's desperately important to everything else we care about in our lives and about leading the world that we have a strong and vibrant economy.\nYes, the rates are growth are going to vary over time. It is true that I'm one who believes that we can operate at higher levels than most economists would have told you 20 years ago were possible; that is to say with higher real rates of growth without inflation, which means stability and job growth and all the other things that are important.\nO'NEILL: I do believe that. But I also understand my place in this, and that place is to let Alan Greenspan make monetary policy.\nFrom my point of view, it will be important for me to have ideas and suggestions for the president for the formulation of his policy, so that the balance of fiscal policy and monetary policy doesn't get out of kilter and we don't do damage to the very important idea that we need to be the economic engine of the world.\nThank you.\nBUSH: Thank you.

I want to thank all four for their hospitality and their gracious reception of the newly elected president. I made it clear to each that I come to Washington with the intention of doing the people's business, that I look forward to listening and occasionally talking, to work with both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nI told all four that I felt like this election happened for a reason--that it pointed out the delay in the outcome. It should make it clear to all of us that we can come together to heal whatever wounds may exist, whatever residuals there may be.\nAnd I really look forward to the opportunity. I hope they've got my sense of optimism about the possible and enthusiasm about the job.\nI told all four that there are going to be some times where we don't agree with each other, but that's OK. If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut I'm excited.\nI'm excited about the potential. And I'm excited about what we can do together for America.\nIt's a great honor to be here.

The things they care about, we must work together on. We will find a way to do it.\nSo, President-elect George W. Bush, welcome to the Capitol, and we look forward to many more opportunities to visit with you here and at your new place also.\nBUSH: Thank you, sir.\nGEPHARDT: Mr. Speaker and Mr. President-elect and leaders, we had a very good meeting this morning. I appreciate Governor Bush coming here and talking with us. We had a very encouraging meeting. And we look forward to working with him and his new administration in the days ahead to get the people's business done.\nI want to reiterate what President-elect Bush said about working together. And sometimes there's a message in an election, in the way an election comes out, and I agree with him and I agree with what Al Gore said the other night when he said, sometimes God sends a message about how things should go.\nI had a meeting with constituents some months back, and I had someone stand up and say, \"The trouble with you people in Washington is you're always fighting and you never compromise, you never get anything done.\" And the next person got up and said, \"The trouble with you people in Washington is you're always compromising and you never fight for what you believe in.\" And I said, \"You know, I hope you're all listening to this. This is a real contradiction. I can't do both.\" And then a third person stood up and said, \"No, you don't get it. We know you fight for what you believe in and we want you to do that, but we also want you to finally negotiate your way to a solution to get things done for us.\"\nAnd I think that was the message of this election. That's what the president-elect and I talked about today.\nAnd I can tell you that we will be there, coming 50 percent of the way, sometimes even a little further, to the middle to get things done for the people that sent us here and hired us.\nNow, we'll hear from Tom Daschle, our great friend from the United States Senate.\nDASCHLE: Mr. President-elect, Mr. Speaker, fellow leaders, I too welcome our new president-elect in the most heartfelt and sincere way. This is a historic moment. It isn't often that the four leaders have the opportunity to meet with the president under any circumstances, but it's especially a privilege for us to have the opportunity to meet with him now.\nIt's an opportunity for us to wipe the slate clean, to begin anew, with a recognition that we have many, many challenges ahead. And as we face those challenges, the only real choice for us is to recognize that bipartisanship isn't an option, it's a requirement.\nAnd as we go forward, it is my sincere desire to work with our Republican colleagues in the Congress, to work with the president-elect to accomplish as much as the American people expect of us. We can do no less.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gephardt, three times yesterday you refused to call Mr. Bush a legitimate president. I have two questions: Why? And second, why should the American people believe that you will work with this man when you question his legitimacy.\nSenator Daschle, do you consider Mr. Bush a legitimate president?\nAnd perhaps the president-elect would like to comment on your answers.\nBUSH: Yes, is my answer.\n(LAUGHTER)\nGEPHARDT: Well, a little later today I believe, and maybe it's already happened, the electors are going to elect George W. Bush to be the next president of the United States, and I believe on January 20, not too many steps from here, here's going to be sworn in as the next president of the United States. I don't know how you can get more legitimate than that.\nDASCHLE: I'm glad you asked that question, Lisa, because I understand it was raised again in the Washington Times this morning. Absolutely, President-elect Bush is the legitimate president of the United States. The electors will determine that today. As Dick said, the inauguration will determine that on January 20.\nLet's put this campaign behind us. Let's find a way with which to begin working together in a constructive way.\nAnd the most important thing we can do to recognize the level of urgency with which to do that is to recognize the legitimacy of his presidency and to begin working with him.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, during the campaign you said the first bill you'd send to Congress would be education, but there are signs of uneasiness in the economy and all the discussion about tax cuts and some confusion as to what some of the leaders in your own party have said about taking small steps versus larger steps. What is your recommendation to the leaders of your party, here? And how will you work with Democrats to pass that $1.3 billion tax cut?\nBUSH: Well, I still think the first bill that I'm going to send up is the education bill. Secondly, we had good discussions about the tax relief package that I intend to propose.\nI think all four standing here understand that I campaigned on a clear view of tax relief, and that's what I'm going to bring to the floor of the House and the Senate.\nThere's going to be a lot of discussions, a lot of head-knocking, a lot of kind of gentle arm-twisting. I'm sure they'll be twisting my arm. I might try to twist a few myself to reach what's right for America.\nAnd I believe I'm standing here because I campaigned on issues that people heard. And one of those issues is tax relief; another is education reform; another is health care reform; another military, making sure our military is not only strong today, but modern for the future.\nWe need to have long discussions about Social Security and how to make sure that we not only have--people have options and say over their own money, but a plan that helps the accumulation of capital, so that entrepreneurial growth continues.\nWe got a lot of room, a lot of areas to discuss. And I've got opinions, and they've got opinions.\nIt's amazing what happens when you listen to the other person's opinion. And we began the process of doing that today.\nI am mindful of the difference between the executive branch and the legislative branch. I assured all four of these leaders that I know the difference. And that difference is, they pass the laws and I execute them. I'd just like to have a say. And that's what a campaign is all about.\nAnd so I really look forward to the continued discussions. This isn't Â– as far as I'm concerned, this is the beginning of relationships. I hope they realize that this isn't a single photo opportunity, and that maybe we'll see each other and talk to each other in the future.\nThat's just not the way I do business, and I wanted to come and look them in the eye and say that.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, on the point of tax cuts, sir, isn't it possible this past year that perhaps it wasn't the most tenable of ideas Â– it was done with the intent to make an end run around Steve Forbes early on in the campaign. Particularly now, in light of worries about the economy, it's something that you may not be able to sell. And I'm wondering, sir, if the Republican leadership on the Hill, if they did not pass that tax cut, would they in fact be throwing you a lifeline and taking some of the pressure off an untenable program?\nBUSH: Well, actually, first, I think you're going to find out about me. I campaigned and say things because I believe them. And the reason I campaigned on a tax relief package is because I believe it. I believe it's essential for our country to make the code more fair.\nOne of the things we didn't have time to discuss today, but I'm confident we will, is that part of the tax relief package made the code more fair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.\nYou see, one of the dreams that we all share Â– and I'm confident that Democrats share the same dream that Republicans do Â– they want the middle-class accessible to all and yet the tax code makes it awfully difficult for some. And so I spent a lot of time talking about that on the campaign trail because I believe it, not because I was trying to position myself against another candidate.\nSecondly, I talked about marginal rate reduction to serve as an insurance policy against a potential economic downturn. I was saying that a year ago. The potential economic downturn is perhaps more real today than it was a year ago.\nAnd I look forward to making my case to both the leaders on the Republican side and Democrat side, that marginal rate reductions will help spur economic activity and economic growth. I think the case is even more solid today than it was a year ago when I started campaigning on the issue.\nSo it's not only Â– my views relate to the economy as well as the fairness in the code and, as I say, I look forward Â– I understand everybody's not going to agree with anything I say, but the good news is that we have started the process where they get to listen and I listen as well to different points of view.\nQUESTION: Sir, did you access your tax program with the chairman of the Fed this morning?\nBUSH: The reason I hesitate is I'm not so sure the chairman of the Fed wants me to be discussing in public what I discuss with him in private.\nQUESTION: In the past, some aspects of...\nBUSH: Maybe you ought to ask him his opinion.\nWe had a very good meeting. Alan Greenspan is an extraordinary man who has the respect of all five of us up here. And he's got his views about the short term and the long term of the economy, but it's best that he describe those view to you.\nBut I did, I spent a lot of time talking to him about a variety of subjects, including energy. And we must be concerned in this country about energy. We must be concerned about shortages and at the same time, obviously, concerned about conservation. And we spent a lot of time talking about energy.\nAnd I understand the responsibility of the executive branch is to lay out an energy strategy, what's good for everybody in this country. And that's exactly what we're going to do. And I'm looking forward to explaining the rationale behind the strategy to the members and the leaders who are here.\nLast question, then I got to keep moving.\n(CROSSTALK)\nBUSH: Yes, very good.\nQUESTION: Sir, you were fond of saying, during the campaign, that you would come to Washington and announce to the Congress that you had a mandate, that you campaigned on these issues, including tax relief, and that you were going to need that through. The truth of the matter is that, as you acknowledged in your acceptance speech, the country is not speaking with a clear voice, so are you prepared to say today that there is no room for compromise on the size and the scope of your tax cut plan?\nBUSH: What I'm prepared to say today is that I laid out, in specific, what I think is right when it comes to tax relief.\nI still believe it's the right thing. And my first priority was to come to the Hill and explain why I think it's the right thing to Republicans and Democrats. They may or may not agree it's the right thing, but I'm going to keep explaining until the votes start coming.\nAnd, secondly, I believe the reason I stand here is because I took clear and strong positions on important issues such as tax relief or Medicare reform or Social Security reform or education reform. And I look forward to working with the members to get it done with one thing in mind: What's best for the country? What is best for the country? And that's the question that I'm going to ask.\nAnd the good news is that, after my meeting with the four members up here, they asked the same question. And it's a darn good place to start.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2000-12-18", "title": "Remarks by the President-Elect Following a Meeting with Congressional Leaders"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84902", "text": "PRESIDENT-ELECT BUSH: Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming.\nI'm looking forward to my trip up to Washington today. Got a full day tomorrow, part on Capitol Hill, partly to interview folks for my Cabinet. I look forward to my visit with the president and the vice president on Tuesday.\nBefore I departed Austin, I thought it'd be important to continue announcing those who are going to serve in my administration. Today, I have the honor and privilege of naming three such persons, starting with Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who is going to be my national security adviser.\nDr. Rice is not only a brilliant person, she is an experienced person. She is a good manager. I trust her judgment. America will find that she is a wise person.\nAnd I'm so honored you're joining the administration.\nSecondly, I'm proud to announce that Al Gonzales, Supreme Court justice of Texas, has agreed to become my White House counsel. I understand how important it is to have a person who I can trust and whose judgment I trust to serve as the White House counsel.\nI know firsthand I can trust Al's judgment, because he was my first counsel as governor. I then named him secretary of state of Texas, where he did a fantastic job, and then he became a Supreme Court judge.\nAl is a distinguished lawyer. Al is a man who has only one standard in mind when it comes to ethics, and that is the highest of high standards.\nSo I'm honored you're back with me, Counselor. Look forward to working together.\nAnd finally, as counselor to the president, Karen Hughes. I've known Karen for a long, long time. I--we knew each other when the definition of a motorcade was one car. She has been at my side, and I trust her a lot. She is going to help us in the White House with strategic planning. She is a woman who is frank, straightforward; she has got enormous judgment, as well.\nSo it is a huge honor to have these three citizens agree to go to Washington, D.C., to make a big sacrifice on behalf of our country, and America will be better off that these three have agreed to serve.\nAnd so what I thought I would do is ask Condi and Al and Karen to say a few remarks, and then I would be glad to answer a few questions. I emphasize a few, because I've got to go upstairs and pack for the trip up to Washington.\nCondi?\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect. I am absolutely delighted, and indeed honored, in fact, humbled, that President-elect Bush has asked me to serve as his national security adviser.\nIt is a wonderful time for the United States in foreign policy, because it is a time when markets and democracy are spreading, when our values are being affirmed around the world, and yet it's a time of great challenge.\nAnd there is one thing that I know after having worked with Governor, now President-elect, Bush for the last 18 months, and that is that he is a man with tremendously good judgment, with strong values and principles. I know that he is tough. I know that he cares about America, and that he knows what makes America great in the world.\nHe will conduct a foreign policy that combines humility with strength.\nAnd I very much look forward to being a part with the foreign policy team, of shaping that foreign policy, and carrying it out on his behalf. It's a great foreign policy team that he is putting together. Many of us have worked together before, and I know that it will be a team that will advance his agenda.\nI also look forward to working with the very fine White House staff that Andy Card is assembling, because it is, after all, the role of the White House staff to make certain that the president's agenda is advanced in Washington, and abroad, as well.\nIf I may close with just a personal note, this is an extraordinary time for America because our values are being affirmed, and it's important to always remember what those values are at home. And I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. I did not go to integrated schools until I was in tenth grade, and we moved to Denver, Colorado. And there is very often a lot said about whether we've made any progress as one America.\nI think that you will see in the presidency of George W. Bush recognition of how important it is that we continue the last thirty-plus years of progress toward one America, that he will have an administration that is inclusive, an administration that is bipartisan, and, perhaps most importantly, an administration that affirms that united we stand and divided we fall. And I'm very proud to have a chance to be a part of it. Thank you very much.\nBUSH: Counselor?\nALBERTO GONZALES: Mr. President-elect, this is the fourth time in six years that I've had the opportunity to say thank you.\nThank you for giving me another opportunity to serve.\nI have the great privilege currently of serving on the Texas Supreme Court, and it's been a tremendous honor to serve the citizens of Texas, and to work with this particular group of justices.\nBut working with the president-elect for three years as his general counsel gave me the opportunity to get to know the type of man that he is, how he makes decisions, what kind of information is important to him in making those kinds of decisions. And in him I saw a man of unparalleled integrity and judgment.\nAnd quite frankly, Mr. President-elect, I could not pass up the opportunity to come serve with you again, and I am very grateful. Thank you.\nBUSH: Other counselor to the president.\nKAREN HUGHES: Well, Mr. President-elect, it's been an amazing six and a half years since I first went to work with you.\nI have worked with Governor--President-elect and Mrs. Bush; I'm still working on that--President-elect and Mrs. Bush for the last six and a half years. And I can Â– we've been through a lot of good times, and some difficult ones, and I can honestly say that I respect and admire both of them more today than on the day I went to work for them six and half years ago. And I Â– given all we've been through, I think that's an enormous compliment.\nI'm honored to be a part of the president-elect's team. I'm honored to serve my country. I am the granddaughter of a coal miner. And my Grandpa Parfit (ph) didn't want his boys to grow up working in the coal mines, so he emphasized the importance of education. And my uncle became the superintendent of schools, and my dad was a major general in the United States Army.\nAnd every day of his life, my grandfather Parfit was filled with a sense of awe and amazement and a deep humility and gratitude to God that we are blessed with an enormous sense of possibility here in America. And I hope that my son and all the children of our country grow up understanding that that same sense of possibility and opportunity is available to them.\nI will work to serve you faithfully, sir. And I promise I will always give you my unvarnished opinions.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: No question about that.\nQUESTION: Tomorrow, Mr. President-elect, you're having breakfast with Alan Greenspan.\nBUSH: Yes, I am.\nQUESTION: Do you think the Fed chairman shares your view that there is a recession on the horizon?\nBUSH: I think it's best for him--for he and I to have our discussion first, and I look forward to it. I have always admired Alan Greenspan. He's got good judgment.\nHe's Â– I really do. I can't wait to hear what he has to say. And I'll let him speak for himself. One of the things I'm certain that I should not do as president-elect is to try to put words in the mouth of Alan Greenspan.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, in the last two days you have appointed two women, two African-Americans, a Hispanic-American. Aside from the fact that these are incredibly competent, qualified people, is there another message that you are sending to America with these first choices?\nBUSH: You bet: that people that work hard and make the right decisions in life can achieve anything they want in America. And I think that my friend Al Gonzales, who is a great lawyer Â– but his background is such a compelling story.\nAnd let me first say that he wouldn't be standing here if I knew he couldn't do the job. But he's a guy who grew up in a two-bedroom house, his mother and daddy working, you know, as hard as they possibly can to bring up six brothers and sisters?\nGONZALES: Seven.\nBUSH: Seven siblings; eight in the family. And now he's going to be sitting at the right hand of the president of the United States.\nTo me, these appointments Â– and each person has got their own story that is so unique, stories that really explain what America can and should be about.\nAnd so I welcome them. I can't tell you how good of folks they are, not only in terms of the jobs they'll have, but just in the quality of character.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, you're about to go to Washington to try to reach out to the other party and unify the nation. You face a very divided Congress, and yet you and your top advisers have talked about not compromising at all on the $1.3 trillion tax cut.\nToday, some Democratic leaders have said that would be the most divisive thing that could happen, not compromising. Is there no room for compromise here? And do you think this is the right signal to send as you begin this peacemaking trip to Washington?\nBUSH: Well, Tom, I campaigned on a tax relief package that I firmly believe Â– believed then and believe even more now, is important as an insurance policy against any economic downturn.\nAnd I look forward to discussing my vision of tax relief with the parties. I mean, it doesn't seem to make much sense for people to be drawing lines in the sand until we've had a chance to discuss things.\nAnd so I'm going to go to Washington and be able to say to people, this is what I told the people, and explain why I told them what I told them. And I think it's a little early in the process for people to be declaring--making judgments on our plan before they've given me a chance to explain it.\nSecondly, I think we have a unique opportunity to make the tax code more fair. And I know you've heard the story innumerable times. You probably still dream about this single mother with two children.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut the code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. And one of the reasons to cut marginal rates is to encourage economic activity. Another reason to affect marginal rates, particularly at the bottom end of the ladder, coupled with an increase in the child credit, is to make the code more fair for those who struggle to get into the middle class.\nAnd so, I understand the process. And I look forward to making my case, and visiting with as many members of both parties as I can. And it's going to be an interesting couple of days. But it's the beginning of a relationship where they're going to find out about me, that I'll tell them what I believe and I'll listen to what they believe. And I'll talk about what I intend to do, and they'll talk about what they intend to do.\nAnd it's the beginning of a dialogue that is crucial in order to get some positive things done, not only on tax relief, but on education reform and Social Security reform and Medicare reform, the need to strengthen the military. And I'm very optimistic.\nYes?\nQUESTION: The last time you were in Washington, I believe it was six months ago, when you were still a candidate for the White House. As you are flying into Washington tonight as president-elect, is there some special feeling that you'll have?\nBUSH: I'm sure there will be. Probably not quite as special as it will be right before the inauguration, but it will be special. It's going to be a Â– it will be a unique moment, or a series of unique moments, starting with sitting down and talking with Alan Greenspan, who America knows to be a distinguished, thoughtful economist. And I look forward to going to the Hill. And then I'm very much looking forward to talking with the vice president and to the president. And it's going to be, I'm confident, a memorable trip.\nQUESTION: One last question. You spoke before of making the national security adviser a Cabinet post. Is that still...\nBUSH: No, I've decided not to do that. Of course, I want Condi to come to every Cabinet meeting, but I think it's best that she not be a member of the Cabinet. I think it's best that she be an equal partner of the senior team in the White House.\nHaving said that, I can sure you that she and I will be spending an inordinate amount of time with each other. I will be seeing her on a daily basis and being briefed on the Â– yes, Patsy?\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, can you tell us when you might begin putting together your economic team?\nBUSH: Pretty soon. I've got some interviews to do and some further deliberations. I've got some people in mind, but I'm not quite ready to tell you who they are yet.\nQUESTION: What about defense secretary? General Powell yesterday said that the issue had been resolved. Have you in effect selected Defense?\nBUSH: No, I think what he meant by the issue being resolved, the issue is resolved as to who gets to pick the defense secretary.\nNo, I haven't yet.\nThank you all for coming. I look forward to seeing you in Washington.", "timestamp": "2000-12-17", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference in Austin Naming Condoleezza Rice as National Security Advisor and Alberto Gonzales and Karen Hughes as White House Counselors"}
{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84896", "text": "BUSH: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for that warm Crawford welcome. Laura and I are delighted to back to our new home, and we're delighted to welcome two distinguished Americans with us. First, this isn't Vice President-elect Cheney's first visit to Crawford, as you well know. He keeps telling me every time he comes down to visit, let's go to Crawford, (LAUGHTER)\nBut it's an honor to be here with Dick Cheney, a man who understands good people and good country, and Mr. Vice President-elect, thanks for coming down. (APPLAUSE)\nMany times during the course of my campaign, I said that if all went well, General Colin Powell just might be called back into the service of his country. Today, it is my privilege to make that call, and ask him to become the 65th secretary of state of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE)\nColin Powell first answered the call to duty as a lieutenant in the United States Army, where he served for 35 years. He's been a decorated infantry officer, an Army Corps commander, a national security adviser, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, adviser to our last three presidents, providing good counsel, strong leadership, and an example of integrity for everyone with whom he served.\nHis entire life has prepared him to fulfill the responsibilities that he will soon hold. General Powell is an American hero, an American example, and a great American story. It's a great day when a son of the South Bronx succeeds to the office first held by Thomas Jefferson.\nMuch has changed since our country's early days, but the fundamental principles guiding American foreign policy are the same.\nBUSH: Foreign policy in the coming years must serve our national interests in the world, while speaking for the highest of America's ideas. In word and deed, we must be clear and consistent and confident that our values are real, and we must be true to our friends.\nWe must conduct our foreign policy in the spirit of national unity and bipartisanship. Our next secretary of state believes, as I do, that we must work closely with our allies and friends in times of calm, so that we will be work together in times of crises.\nHe believes, as I do, that our nation is best when we project our strength and purpose with humility. As president, I will set our priorities, and we will stand by them.\nIf we do not set our own agenda, it will be set by others: potential adversaries, or the crises of the moment. Our administration will work with our allies in Europe and in the Far East and around the world to extend the peace.\nWe will promote a fully democratic western hemisphere bound together by free trade. We will defend America's interests in the Persian Gulf, and advance peace in the Middle East, based as any lasting peace must be on a secure Israel.\nWe will fight the weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. We will work towards a world that trades in freedom.\nAnd my administration will understand that American values always are at the center of our foreign policy. Our stand for human freedom is not an empty formality of diplomacy, but a founding and guiding principle of this great land. By promoting democracy, we lay the foundation for a better and more stable world.\nBUSH: This is a moment of great opportunity, and my administration will seize it. America has unique power and unmatched influence, and we will use them in the service of democracy, spreading peace across the world and across the years.\nIn this cause, I know of no better person to be the face and voice of American diplomacy that Colin L. Powell. Wherever he goes, and whomever he meets, the world will see the finest of the United States of America.\nIn this office, he follows in the footsteps not only of Jefferson, but also of one of his personal heroes, General George C. Marshall. And I would say of General Powell what Harry Truman said of General Marshall: \"He is a tower of strength and common sense. When you find somebody like that, you have to hang onto him.\"\nI have found such a man. In directness of speech, his towering integrity, his deep respect for our democracy, and his soldier's sense of duty and honor, Colin Powell demonstrates the qualities that made George Marshall a great secretary of state, qualities that will make him a great representative of all the people of this country.\nAnd so, it's a great honor for me to submit the name to the United States Senate of Colin L. Powell as secretary of state. (APPLAUSE)\nPOWELL: Thank you, very much. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thank you, very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)\nPOWELL: Thank you so very much, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President-elect and Mrs. Bush, Mr. Vice President-elect Cheney, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of Crawford, Texas.\nIt's a great pleasure to be with you this afternoon, and I'm honored, honored, to be given the opportunity to return to public service as the 65th secretary of state of the United States of America.\nPOWELL: Mr. President-Elect, I thank you for the confidence that you have placed in me, and I look forward to serving you, the American people, and the cause of peace and freedom around the world.\nAnd it is a special privilege for me to once again to serve with Vice President-elect Dick Cheney. We have been through many adventures together and many more adventures await us in the future.\nMr. President-elect, during your administration you'll be faced with many challenges, and crises that we don't know anything about right now will come along. But I believe that these challenges and these crises will pale in comparison to the wonderful opportunities that await us: Opportunities that have been brought about by the end of the Cold War; by the spread of democracy and the free enterprise system around the world; opportunities that come to us because we held steadfast in our belief in democracy; opportunities that will come to us become of the information of technology revolutions that are reshaping the world as we know it, destroying political boundaries and all kinds of other boundaries as we are able to move information and capital data around the world at the speed of light, able to move knowledge around the world at the speed of light; opportunities that will come to us because the old world map as we knew it of a red side and a blue side, that competed for something called the third world is gone, and the new map is a mosaic, a mosaic of many different pieces and many different colors spreading around the world, a world that has seen that communism did not work, fascism did not work, Nazism did not work.\nIf you want to be successful in the 21st century, you must find your path to democracy, market economics, and a system which frees the talents of men and women to pursue their individual destinies. And at the center of this revolution, America stands, inspiration for the world that wants to be free, and we will continue to be that inspiration by uniquely American internationalism, as President-elect Bush has stated it.\nNot by using our strength and our position of power to get back behind our walls, but by being engaged with the world. By first and foremost, letting our allies know that we appreciate all we have been through over the last 50 years, and our alliances are as strong now as they every have been, and they are as needed now as they ever have been, and we'll work with our allies to expand and make those alliances the center of our foreign policy activity.\nWe will work with those nations in the world that are transforming themselves, nations such as China and Russia. We will work with them not as potential enemies, and not as adversaries, but not yet as strategic partners, but as nations that are seeking their way.\nPOWELL: We will have areas of agreement and areas of difference, and we will discuss them in rational ways, letting them know of our values, letting them know of the principles that we hold dear.\nFor those nations that are not yet on this path of democracy and freedom, for those nations who are poorly led, led by failed leaders pursing failed policies that will give them failed results, we will stand strong.\nWe will stand strong with our friends and allies against those nations that pursue weapons of mass destruction, that practice terrorism. We will not be afraid of them. We will not be frightened by them. We will meet them. We will match them. We will contend with them. We will defend our interests from a position of strength.\nThat strength comes to us from the power of our system, the democracy and free enterprise system. It comes to us from our economic power. It comes to us from our military power. And as we go into this new century, and as we begin this new administration, we have to make sure that all of those elements of power are protected and allowed to thrive even more.\nWith an economy that is strong, growing, part of the now international system, global trade, with military power, we are the best on the face of the earth. We're going to keep it that way.\nAnd we're going to take actions early on to ensure that our young men and women who might be called to go in harm's way have what they need to be successful. We owe that to them.\nI spent a good part of my life helping those GIs get ready for battle, and I spent a good part of my life up on Congress, before Congress, working hard to get those troops what they needed.\nWell, I don't have to do that quite anymore, but I will certainly be there with the secretary of defense, assisting the secretary in getting what he needs for the military.\nBut I now will be up before the Congress, letting them know, in the most powerful terms that I can muster, that the dedicated men and women of the State Department need that same kind of support.\nThey are in the front lines, they are part of this contest, they are part of the battle, and we must make sure that when they go to do the work of the American people they not only have the support that they need, but they have the resources that they need, and that will be a priority of my stewardship as Secretary of State.\nSo I think these are promising times, times of great opportunity, but times, also, of challenge and danger. We are up to the task.\nPOWELL: President-elect Bush has given us the guidance we need. We are going to pull together a great team. We're going to communicate with the American people to make sure that we are crafting a foreign policy that reflects their values and their will. We will work with Congress in a bipartisan fashion, so that we can arrive at consensus and that the world can see us united behind our foreign policy.\nExciting times, and I'm so proud to be a part of those times, and I thank the president-elect for giving me this opportunity.\nI'm especially pleased that he chose to hold this ceremony in a school in Crawford, Texas. I was, frankly, glad it wasn't at the ranch. (LAUGHTER)\nNothing wrong with ranches, but I don't yet do ranch-wear very well. (LAUGHTER)\nHey, I'm from the South Bronx, and I don't care what you say, those cows look dangerous. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nBut the real reason I'm so happy that we're doing this in a school is because for the last several years of my life, I've been working with young people, young people such as the students who come here everyday to be prepared for the future. I have been working hard as the Chairman of America's Promise, the alliance for youth, a great crusade that we have been conducting for the past few years. It was a mission that was given to me by former President Bush and President Clinton, and former President Carter, President Ford, and Mrs. Reagan.\nWe've accomplished a lot over the last three years, and as I now take on new duties as secretary of state, I want to say to all of the partners who have worked with us on America's Promise that I'm not leaving it. I'm going to find a way to continue to play an important role in the work of America's Promise, and the president-elect has encouraged me to do just that.\nI go around the country telling people, no matter how busy you are, you have time to give back to young people, and that's what I'm going to do as secretary of state, not only to encourage other cabinet officers to do likewise, but hopefully to take this Promise message around the world so that all nations realize that we have nothing more valuable as a national asset in anyone's country than the young people, and we have to prepare them. So the little red wagon will still be a part of my life.\nAnd, finally, I would just like to note that in the newspaper stories that will be written about this occasion, they will say that Colin Powell, first African-American to ever hold the position of secretary of state. And I'm glad they will say that, and I want it repeated.\nPOWELL: I want it repeated because I hope it will give inspiration to young African-Americans coming along, but beyond that, all young Americans coming all, that no matter where you began in this society, with hard work and with dedication and with the opportunities that are presented by this society, there are no limitations upon you.\nAnd I also want to pay tribute to so many people who helped me reach this position in life: African-Americans who came before me, who never could have risen to this position because the conditions weren't there, and they had to fight to change those conditions.\nFor me, this isn't history. It's my lifetime. I was exposed to these things in my lifetime. And I will work with President-elect Bush and with Vice President-elect Cheney to do everything I can do to help them, to show to America, as President-elect Bush said the other evening, that this will be an administration, he will be a president for all the people, all the time.\nI know that is the deepest emotion in his heart. The American people will see that in due course. We'll get over these difficulties that we have seen in recent days, and we'll come through this a stronger, greater nation on the way to that more perfect union that we always dream about. Thank you, very much. (APPLAUSE)\nBUSH: The secretary of state designee and I will take a few questions. Yes, Tom?\nQUESTION: General Powell (OFF-MIKE) there are some preliminary talks this weekend in Washington. Will you be monitoring these, and when you become secretary of state, what do you see as the (OFF-MIKE)?\nPOWELL: I will certainly be monitoring them, but you know, you can only have one president, one secretary of state, and one foreign policy team at a time. And so, although we'll be monitoring them, it is entirely in the hands of President Clinton, Dr. Albright and their team.\nIt is absolutely a given that under a Bush administration, America will remain very much engaged in the Middle East.\nPOWELL: I expect it to be a major priority of mine, and of the department. It will be based on the principle that we must always ensure that Israel lives in freedom, and in security and peace. But at the same time, we have to do everything we can to deal with the aspirations of the Palestinians and the other nations in the region who have an interest in this.\nAnd so I think America will continue to be a friend to all sides. America will continue to put forward ideas. America will remain engaged until we can find that solution to this most difficult problem.\nBut at the end of the day, it's going to be the parties in the region who will have to find that solution and come into agreement. They are going to have to live with each other, and hopefully, in the near future, we can find ways that they can accommodate their differences, and find that elusive solution. It is elusive, but it is out there somewhere, and hopefully, if it doesn't happen in the very near future and becomes something for us to manage, you can be sure that we'll be fully engaged in trying to find a solution to that problem.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nPOWELL: We're in a different situation now than we had in 1991 and 1992. At the end of the Gulf War, your acting regime agreed to the conditions that brought an end to the conflict, that they would fully account for all the weapons of mass destruction and other evil technologies that they were working on.\nThey have not yet fulfilled those agreements, and my judgment is that sanctions in some form must be kept in place until they do so. We will work with our allies to re-energize the sanctions regime. And I will make the case in every opportunity I get that we're not doing this to hurt the Iraqi people, we're doing this to protect the peoples of the region, the children of the region, who would be the targets of these weapons of mass destruction if we didn't contain them and get rid of them.\nSaddam Hussein is sitting on a failed regime that is not going to be around in a few years' time. The world is going to leave him behind, and that regime behind, as the world marches to new drummers, drummers of democracy and the free enterprise system.\nAnd I don't know what it will take to bring him to his senses, but we are in the strong position, he is in the weak position. And I think it is possible to re-energize those sanctions, and to continue to contain him, and then confront him should that become necessary again.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nPOWELL: Our plan is to undertake a review right after the president is inaugurated, and take a look not only at our deployments in Bosnia, but in Bosnia and Kosovo and many other places around the world, and make sure those deployments are proper. Our armed forces are stretched rather thin, and there is a limit to how many of these deployments we can sustain.\nSo, we're going to take a look at that. We're going to talk to our allies. We're going to consult. We're going to make on-the-ground assessments of what we're doing now, what's needed now, but also, what is really going to be needed in the future, and see if we can find ways that it is less of a burden on our armed forces, not as a way of running out, but as a way of substituting others, or substituting other kinds of organizations and units and perhaps police organizations to handle the remaining missions.\nSo, we're not cutting and running. We're going to make a careful assessment of it in consultation with our allies, and then make some judgments after that assessment is completed.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nPOWELL: What kind of person would I like to work with as president?\nBUSH: She said \"who\" first.\nPOWELL: Who? (LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: That's called trying to get a scoop, aren't you? (LAUGHTER)\nPOWELL: That's been resolved... (APPLAUSE)\nPOWELL: ... to my great delight.\nBUSH: Anything else here? Yes?\nQUESTION: General, will (OFF-MIKE)\nPOWELL: The president-elect has made a commitment to a national missile defense. I have watched the debates on national missile defense for many, many years.\nAnd I think a national missile defense is an essential part of our overall strategic force posture, which consists of offensive weapons, command and control systems, intelligence systems and a national missile defense. And I still hearken back to the original purpose of such a defense, and that is to start diminishing the value of offensive weapons.\nWe have been pursuing the technology. I'm quite confident that when a secretary of defense is named, that person will go into the Pentagon and make a full assessment of the state of technology--where are we, what can we accomplish--and structure a plan that is consistent with the approach that then Governor Bush gave in Washington early this year.\nSo, we're going to go forward. We have to spend time discussing it with our allies, discussing it with other nations in the world that possess strategic offensive weapons and don't yet understand our thinking with respect to national missile defense.\nPOWELL: These will be tough negotiations; I don't expect them to be easy. But they will have to come to the understanding that we feel this is in the best interests of the American people, and not only the American people, the people of the world, to finally start to move in the direction where we can take away the currency associated with strategic offensive weapons, and the blackmail that is inherent in some regime having that kind of weapon and thinking they can hold us hostage.\nBUSH: Thank you all for having us.

{"author": "George W. Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84886", "text": "BUSH: Listen, thank you all for coming. I'm so honored that Senator John Breaux is here, thankful that he came, stopped off in Texas on his way back home to Louisiana. We've had a great discussion over lunch.\nAnd one of the things the senator made it clear is he wants to stay in the Senate and work with--to work to get something done, that he views this as a unique opportunity in American history for Republicans and Democrats to focus on health care, whether it be the Breaux-Frist idea when it comes to Medicare or a patients' bill of rights bill, and to work together for education.\nAnd I am so honored that he would come. He's a practical man who has got good common sense. And we used to always say around here, the only thing that separates Texas and Louisiana is the Sabine River. (inaudible) Thanks for coming.\nBREAUX: Well, Governor, thank you very much, Mr. President-elect, thanks for lunch, and thanks for the opportunity to have some real good discussions, I think, about what you want to try and do.\nI think we certainly share the concept that we have to build coalitions in order to get anything done. And we look forward to you coming to Washington and meeting with our leadership and trying to find some ways we can make government work for everybody.\nBUSH: Can I take a few questions?\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, would you have liked the senator to have been able to serve in your administration? And are you looking at other Democrats with possible Cabinet posts?\nBUSH: Well, I am. I'm thinking about, you know, a variety of folks to serve in the Cabinet. And I am so thankful that Senator Breaux wants to get some positive things done.\nThose of you who followed me during the campaign remember I often spoke about Senator Breaux in terms of Medicare and health care. He's a man--he's broken a lot of ground there in Washington. And so I am really honored to have his commitment to work with me, and my commitment to work with him, to get some positive things done.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, isn't it true that Colin Powell will be your first Cabinet announcement? And is it also true that your staff is calling Democrats on the Hill as a courtesy to say that, in fact, you'll announce him as secretary of state tomorrow, sir?\nBUSH: Mr. Gregory (ph), thank you for that question. There's a lot of rumors, and there's going to be a lot of rumors between now and when I name my Cabinet.\nI would hope people would give me the benefit of allowing me to name the person on our own timetable. And so, I would ask that the folks wait until tomorrow when I name the persons.\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: I'm sorry for being this way, but...\nBUSH: No, that's OK.\nQUESTION: Are you saying...\nBUSH: Is this a New Year's resolution?\n(LAUGHTER)\nBUSH: I am saying that...\nQUESTION: Are you saying I'm wrong?\nBUSH: I would never dare say a man of your stature is wrong. I'm saying that I look forward to making the announcement tomorrow and I hope you come.\nQUESTION: Leaders in your own party are saying the tax cuts are too big. Are you willing to give any ground?\nBUSH: Well, I read the comments from the speaker. I haven't had a chance to talk to the speaker yet. But what I found to be positive is the speaker was recognizing that we need some tax relief.\nAnd I have made it clear to the speaker once before that, you know, I campaigned on a package that I thought was fair and fiscally sound and responsible, and I will continue--and I strongly believe that. And so I look forward to going to Washington to make the case that plan the people heard in America is the plan that I hope to get passed.\nAt any rate I'm optimistic to know that tax relief discussion is taking place, that people do recognize the need for tax relief.\nQUESTION: Did you ask him if he wanted a Cabinet--how did it--did you offer something?\nBUSH: We had a private conversation, but he made it clear to me that he is looking forward to being one of the leaders in the United States Senate, which is really good news for America. And the reason it's good news for America is because John Breaux has got the attitude that I have, that when you put your country ahead of partisanship, and you put your country ahead of party politics it's amazing what can get done. And the American people, after this election, I am confident are going to say to both Republicans and Democrats, \"Let's come together and get something done on health care and education, on the military.\"\nAnd so I was--John Breaux is the kind of person with whom I can work, as well as who a lot of other folks can work.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, Secretary Cheney has said there are warning signs with the economy and it might build the case for tax cuts. Can you tell us specifically what things in the economy, what indicators...\n(CROSSTALK)\nBUSH: Well, I think people are concerned about the economy. I think there's concerns about some of the manufacturing base. I've heard concerns expressed about the automobile sector.\nI think all of us ought to be concerned about high energy prices. We're seeing what the high price of natural gas is doing on the West Coast.\nSenator Breaux and I had a good discussion about the need for there to be a national energy policy that increases the supply of energy. And I think we ought to be concerned about the effect that high energy prices will ultimately have on our economy.\nI think the ability to attract capital into some of our industries is of concern. I think we got to be worried about the ability for the country to continue to attract foreign capital, to make sure the economy continues to expand.\nAnd so, yes, I think that Vice President-elect Cheney was right in echoing concerns--my concerns about a possible slowdown. And that's one of the reasons I feel so strongly about the need to reduce the marginal rates in our tax cut.\nLast question, Hillary?\nQUESTION: Thank you, sir.\nBUSH: Yes. My pleasure. It's the Christian spirit in me.\n(LAUGHTER)\nQUESTION: Does the fact that Senator Breaux is being vague indicate that the subject that he's been particularly focused on, particularly Medicaid, will be early on your agenda?\nBUSH: Well, that's one of the things we talked about. And the things I intend to do is to work with members of both parties to discuss not only the agenda, but the timing of the agenda.\nAnd Senator Breaux brings a great sense of sophistication about the Senate. He understands how it works, well. And he is a man who understands that results are much more important than rhetoric.\nAnd so, the discussion about Medicare, for example, was a really interesting discussion. It was not only about the particulars--and by the way, we agree nearly 100 percent on what the particulars ought to be--but he gave me a good sense of his view of the timing on how we ought to approach the issue.\nAnd, yes, these ought to be, in my judgment, that the education should be discussed about or the health care issues ought to be our priorities. And I would like to get them done as quickly as possible.\nQUESTION: Mr. President-elect, this is a personal one. Can you describe the moment that it really sunk in that, after this long, protracted fight, you were the president-elect? And what it's been like for you more personally...\nBUSH: I appreciate it, thanks.\nWell, first of all, I felt Vice President Gore was most gracious in his comments. I thought he gave a really good speech. And, of course, that--he set the tone for what I thought was an important night for America. And I let others judge the quality of my speech.\nI didn't sleep that well that night. Are those the kind of details you're interested in?\n(LAUGHTER)\nAt any rate, I...\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nBUSH: Same old pillow, of course, but I'd like to blame it on the cats. But the truth of the matter is, it had been an amazing evening. I woke up the next morning and just settling in and Prime Minister Tony Blair had called from England, and we had very good discussion. And then a series of phone calls started coming in. And you know who they were.\nThe great responsibilities of the job are very evident. I can't tell you how excited I am about getting to Washington; about how enthused I am about the opportunities, not only to work with members of the Senate and House, but to work with other world leaders to make the world more peaceful. And I am so grateful and humbled by the opportunity.\nAnd so, I would tell you, David, that I'm a more patient person than before. My enthusiasm for the opportunity, though, has not in the least been waned. Matter of fact, I even feel more enthusiastic about the opportunity before all of us.\nAnd I can't wait for you to find out who is going to agree to serve in my Cabinet. I think America will be pleased. And over the course of the next couple of weeks we hope to get most of them named. I've assembled a White House staff that is a group of extraordinary Americans who have agreed to serve the country.\nQUESTION: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2000-12-15", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference in Austin"}
{"author": "Richard B. Cheney", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84905", "text": "CHENEY: I'm pleased this afternoon to welcome representatives from GSA here to the transition office. I have Clay Johnson with me, who's the director of the transition, working alongside me. And at this point I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Thurmand Davis, the deputy administrator of the GSA.\nDAVIS: Thank you, sir.\nGood afternoon. First, let me begin by introducing Beth Newberger (ph), who is the associate administrator for communications at GSA; and June Huber (ph), who will be our director of our support team supporting the transition.\nGSA is real proud to be here this afternoon to be one of the first members of the federal family to welcome you, and especially you, Mr. Vice President-elect, to Washington.\nI have here the official key for the transition space, which I'd like to give to you now.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(CROSSTALK)\n(APPLAUSE)\nDAVIS: It's a smart card. And the smart card is the key to the transition space, which is located at 1800 G St., N.W., in Washington. It represents the high-tech environment that GSA's prepared for the transition team, for you and the transition team, provided to support.\nWith the key, you inherit the best that GSA and the government has to offer, and we'll stand ready to provide you full support in your transition space.\nCHENEY: Thanks very much. Thank you, sir.\n(UNKNOWN): Congratulations.\nCHENEY: Clay, you want to hold the key?\nJOHNSON: Thank you, sir.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCHENEY: All right. Well, we're delighted to have this opportunity to begin to receive official support from the government for the Bush-Cheney transition. This has been, as many folks have said, a unique time in American political history.\nThe transition is well under way. We've been able to do that in part through the foresight of the Congress that had authorized the use of private funds as well as public funds for the transition, and we understand why our friends at GSA have been in a difficult position during this period of time until the election was officially resolved, if you will, and, of course, that occurred last night with Vice President Gore's very gracious, I thought, address to the nation, and the acceptance by President-elect Bush. So I'd be happy to respond to a question or two.\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\nCHENEY: The question is, will we remain in these offices or move downtown. We will begin to use the space downtown as we stand up additional parts of the transition--for example, as we begin to identify perspective Cabinet members and put together support staffs for them through the confirmation process, they're likely to be downtown. Some of the elements that are here now will move downtown--the congressional shop, for example; it's a much more convenient location for them.\nAnd I would expect here, in the not-too-distant future, that a lot of what is located here will move downtown. But the folks here have been superb in terms of their support for us, and they've really stepped up at a time when we had a great need and did a lot to make that possible for us, and we want to thank them for that.\nExactly how we finally resolve this question of who's where is still an open question. We haven't really had time to address all of that yet. But we will be using both facilities. For now, I plan to stay here, at least for the next week or two. I live nearby.\n(LAUGHTER)\nIt's a great commute, and I want to take advantage of that, but obviously we'll make decisions based on what's most appropriate in terms of having the transition able to function.\nYes?\nQUESTION: Right now, Vice President-elect Cheney, are you working to streamline the process on the FBI checks? And, also, is there any consideration at all that you would actually leave some people in place, to replace them later? Is that...\nCHENEY: Well, I don't know. Clay, you may want to say a word about the clearance process. We will move as rapidly as we can to have the Cabinet in place by the time of the inauguration. Ordinarily what happens is that we'll name Cabinet members and they'll start the clearance process.\nHopefully once the clearance process is completed, then the papers can go forward to the Congress. The Congress holds--the Senate holds confirmation hearings, and then usually right after the January 20 inauguration, then they begin to vote to confirm Cabinet members. And we're going to try to adhere to that schedule.\nNow there are some things that have to be worked out as we go through that process. And Clay may want to say a word or two about the actual clearance process itself.\nJOHNSON: The FBI understands how unusual this circumstance is, and they've committed to attach additional resources to expedite this every way possible. This is a very unusual time, and everything is truncated, and so we'll be working here to expedite things, and the FBI will be doing their part. And we'll be in discussions with the Senate to make sure that they're getting the information that they need to begin their hearings.\nBut, again, everybody seems to be rising to the occasion to take care of the business that should be taken care of in the time available.\nQUESTION: Secretary Cheney, there's been some talk, sir, that you'd like to have all of the Cabinet members named by next Friday, before the Christmas break.\nCan you adhere to that schedule, or is that just too quick?\nCHENEY: We're going to move just as rapidly as we can. I don't want to set artificial deadlines. I think that would be inappropriate.\nBut we will--well, we've made significant progress, in terms of the conversations that we've been able to have internally with President-elect Bush and myself, Andy Card, Clay and the others who are involved in that effort.\nWe are going to do everything we can to get everybody named as quickly as possible, but I don't want to establish an artificial deadline and say that it's all going to be done a week from Friday. If we make it, that would be fantastic, but I don't want to set out an artificial deadline.\nQUESTION: When do you expect to see the first nominations come out, and then how far have you been set back?\nCHENEY: I expect to see the first announcement soon.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThat's all you're going to get today.\nAnd the process, in terms of the transition being shortened--as I mentioned earlier in our earlier press briefs--it has an impact, because of our ability to go out and begin to actively and aggressively interview people, be able to source various folks, in terms of what kinds of individuals we ought to look for for certain jobs, or to be able to check out the references on certain individuals. All of that has really been pretty limited by virtue of the fact that there was still a lot of uncertainty about going forward.\nThe area, for example, of talking with those in the Democratic Party had been awkward while there was still contest under way. Those constraints are now off, and we're able to begin to be much more aggressive in that regard.\nI might also point out--I think you know, President-elect Bush will be in Washington the first part of next week, most of the day, Monday and Tuesday. He will be meeting with President Clinton at that time as well as Vice President Gore, and also with the bipartisan Congressional leadership. Probably those meetings will take place Monday and Tuesday.\nWe will have a number of other things that we're doing here at that time. One of those, obviously, is the further work with respect to selecting perspective Cabinet members, so there will be a fairly intense period of time at the beginning of the week when he's here Monday and Tuesday.\nQUESTION: How do you plan to reach out to Democrats as you begin the process? And does the president-elect plan to hold press conference any time soon?\nCHENEY: I would refer to you--you probably better check with Karen Hughes in terms of the timing of when President-elect Bush will hold a press conference.\nI think he's already begun the process of reaching out.\nAnd in terms of contacting folks on the other side, I called Joe Lieberman this morning, and we had a very pleasant conversation. I watched Senator Lieberman's speech in the Senate today. I thought it was an eloquent speech, and certainly in keeping with his stature and reputation. And we look forward having the opportunity, the two us, to get together next week and begin to work together. So I would think it's fair to say the reaching-out process has already begun.\nQUESTION: Mr. Secretary?\nCHENEY: Yes?\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) a million dollars that's appropriated by the Congress was for the Office of Government Ethics to come up with concrete ways to expedite and streamline the personnel application process, the background checks, et cetera. Have they specifically told you, at this point, how they intend to streamline and expedite the process?\nCHENEY: I'll ask Clay to address that.\nJOHNSON: I think the new money was to fund a study by them to determine how that could be done in the future. I don't think that the intention was that it would impact us. There was also part of that money that was intended to help us train and indoctrinate new members of the administration to best prepare them to be successful here, and we will develop those programs with those funds and put them to good use.\nQUESTION: Secretary Cheney, Governor Gilmore's name has been mentioned in press reports for a possible Cabinet position. Is he someone that's being considered?\nCHENEY: I can't get into the business today of encouraging speculation.\nI know there's a lot of speculation out there on a lot of people. There are a lot of great folks around that would make a significant contribution in any administration.\nBut I think it's unwise, and perhaps misleading, for me to get into the business of saying we're considering this person, we're not considering that person. So I'm going to refrain from commenting on any one particular individual as we go through this process.\nYes? In the back.\nQUESTION: Mr. Secretary, if that's the case, then when would you possibly be announcing a secretary of state and a national security advisor?\nCHENEY: Soon.\nQUESTION: Monday? Tuesday?\nCHENEY: Soon.\nQUESTION: Mr. Secretary, could you give us a bit more of an idea of what President-elect Bush expects in the meetings with President Clinton and Vice President Gore? And also whether there was something in Vice President Gore's speech last night that you would have like to have heard that you didn't?\nCHENEY: On the latter part, I thought--first of all, I can't speak for President-elect Bush in that regard. Second, I really thought Vice President Gore's speech was very good. I liked it very much; I thought it was totally appropriate to the occasion.\nAnd the widespread praise that it's received in the commentary afterward I thought's been totally appropriate. I share those sentiments.\nWith respect to the meetings next week, my experience from prior transitions has been this begins the exchange, if you will, between the outgoing administration and the incoming administration. One of the things that we have not really been able to do yet in connection with transition is any interface at all with officials in the government administrations and agencies that are already there.\nWe haven't talked with folks in the Defense Department or at State or HUD or any of the other departments. And so, this meeting at the top, if you will, sort of sets all of those kinds of contacts in motion to begin to talk about common problems, and make certain that our people get up to speed so that by January 20th, we're in a position to actually take the reins of government, beginning right after the inauguration.\nAnd I think, it's also--again, my experience has been--and I've been there for--I remember the Ford-Carter transition, for example, in 1976. That was after a very hard-fought contest between Gerry Ford and Jimmy Carter. It was a close contest in the end.\nAnd the thing that I was always struck by was, what emerged out of that first meeting between the two principals was a sincere effort on the part of the outgoing administration to want to help the newcomers, even though they were of the opposite party and they'd just been battling it out until a few days before, and a sincere effort on the part of the incoming administration to want to do everything they could to get it right.\nWhat emerged, of course, from that transaction was, eventually, the fact that Gerry Ford and Jimmy Carter became good friends. And you would you not have bet on that prior to that election.\nSo I think, and I'm not making any predictions today, I'm saying it's a small fraternity of presidents and ex-presidents, and I'm sure that, you know, when the history books are written on this period of time, you'll find that that meeting next week between the two of them will be very important to healing the wounds, to moving on and getting the new administration in place, ready to go. So it's a very important meeting. Symbols are important in this business, and this certainly has great symbolic significance.\nQUESTION: Is there a strategy for sub-Cabinet-level positions, in terms of which ones you'd like to see in place first? And how are you going to go about doing that, whether it's based on the legislative agenda, to get people in the administration who will be important to the first few items of the president-elect's agenda? How will you go about the sub-Cabinet appointment process?\nJOHNSON: Well, there will be sensitivity to what the legislative priorities are, but I'm also advised that the most important first few sub-Cabinet members that a Cabinet secretary can have on his or her team are the general counsels, the legislative affairs and the public affairs people. So those will be priorities for us with each of the Cabinet secretaries.\nQUESTION: Will Mr. Bush be meeting with prospective Cabinet appointees in the next day or two as he indicated?\nCHENEY: That's a reasonable expectation, that in the--clearly over the next couple of weeks, one of the activities he'll be engaged in is talking with prospective Cabinet members.\nQUESTION: What would be the main issue in U.S.-Russian relationship and U.S.-European relationship when you get into the office?\nCHENEY: I'm happy to pontificate on those kinds of issues at the appropriate time, but I really would prefer, given our responsibilities here with respect to this office, to stay focused on the transition. There'll be ample opportunity down the road to talk specifically about various policy areas, U.S.-Russian relations, et cetera. And so I'm going to refrain from getting into those areas today, if I might.\nI'll do one more question. Yes?\nQUESTION: I understand you've got about $2.5 million left over from the private funds you raised for this transition; raised about $3 million, spent about $500,000. What do you expect to do with that remaining money?\nCHENEY: I think the numbers you cited are accurate--that is, I believe we've raised roughly $3 million in the private effort, and spent about $500,000 of that.\nIf you remember, if you go look at the Presidential Transition Act, it's specifically authorizes not only public monies to support the effort, which we've now been provided through GSA, but it also specifically authorizes the raising of private funds to supplement those efforts.\nAnd so, what we've done there is very much in keeping with the statute that's there, and I would expect that before we're through we'll spend some additional amount of that money that's already been raised. I can't today say exactly how much, but the tradition was before, and until fairly recently, that transitions were funded completely with private funds.\nThe appropriation of public monies to support transitions is a relatively recent development, over the last couple of transitions. So the fact that we've got those funds, we will put them to good use, as indicated. If there's anything left over, we'll decide then what's the best way to deal with those.\nOnce again, let me thank all of you for being here today, and let me thank our friends at GSA for their support. We look forward to a very close working relationship, and we're delighted now to have the opportunity, Clay and myself and the other members of the transition team, to begin to aggressively pursue what's going to clearly be an abbreviated, but we hope very successful transition.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2000-12-14", "title": "The Vice President-Elect's News Conference"}
{"author": "Joseph Lieberman", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84911", "text": "Mr. President, you've probably noticed as I have that many things in politics and government seem to be taking a little bit longer than normal this year. It is December 14, and the 106th Congress is surprisingly still in session.\nBut happily, that allows me to come to the Senate chamber, this great American forum which I love and respect so much, and reflect on the extraordinary opportunity Vice President Al Gore gave to me when he asked me to be his running mate this year.\nMr. President, when I accepted the nomination of my party at its convention in Los Angeles in August, I began by asking, \"Is America a great country, or what?\" Last night, we ended that remarkable journey in a disappointing way, but nevertheless, I want to answer my question this morning, by declaring, \"Yes, America is a great country.\"\nAnd let me offer for my colleagues just a few of the reasons why I feel that way today.\nMr. President, in selecting me, a Jewish American, to be his running mate, Vice President Gore did what no presidential candidate before him had done. That required personal courage and confidence in the American people, and today, we can look back and see that the vice president's confidence was totally justified. The fact is that while my faith was the focus of much of the early media reaction to my candidacy, it was not even mentioned at the end of the campaign, and that is the way we had all hoped it would be.\nAnd that's good news, not just for me, but I think for all Americans, because it's a fulfillment of the promise that America makes to its citizens, that in this country no matter who you are or where you start, you should be able to go as far as your God-given talents and individual determination will take you.\nThe absence of bigotry in this campaign, and the fact that the vice president and I received the second highest number of votes in the history of American national elections should, I think, encourage every parent in this country to dream the biggest dreams for each and every one of their children. Anything is possible for anyone in America.\nIn the five weeks since Election Day--because its turned out to be the closest election in American history--our nation's greatness was tested in a different way. But I'm confident that in the end, our election process can only be made stronger by this experience.\nFor one thing, it opened our eyes to some overlooked problems with our system of voting, to the disparities and technologies and practices that may be stopping significant numbers of voters from having their votes counted, and that, in particular, may be undermining the electoral rights of many poor and minority citizens. Those problems call out for a bipartisan investigation and reform.\nMr. President, whether you're happy or sad with the results of the 2000 election, I do think that every one of us should be grateful this morning that here in America we work out our differences not with civil wars, but with spirited elections. We resolve our disputes not through acts of violence, but through the rule of law. And we preserve and protect our system of justice best when we accept its judgments that we disagree with most.\nThis election is over, and I congratulate Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney and wish them well. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to do that personally in a very cordial conversation this morning with the Vice President-elect, Secretary Dick Cheney.\nAs Vice President Gore said eloquently last night, it is time now for all of us to come together in support of these United States and the shared values that have long sustained us.\nGovernor Bush and Secretary Cheney are in my prayers, as I know they are in the prayers of all Americans, as they begin now to assume the awesome responsibilities that go with leadership of this great country.\nIn the strong words and soft voices they both used last night, Vice President Gore and Governor Bush raised us all up and pointed us toward the reconciliation that our history expects and that our national interest now requires. As they both noted last night, this was the closest election we've ever experienced, with the vote for president essentially ending in a tie, the Senate split 50-50, and the House nearly even as well. That puts a special burden, not just on Governor Bush, but on all of us here in Congress, to work on a bipartisan basis and in a cooperative spirit.\nMr. President, as I have in the past, I fully intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with President-elect Bush to find that constructive consensus without which we will not help the American people realize their potential.\nFor my family and me, this campaign has been a thrilling and joyful experience. It has deepened the appreciation we have for the goodness of the American people, and the love and loyalty we feel for this country. We could not have asked for a more warm, open and accepting reception as we traveled around this blessed land.\nWe could not have been more impressed with the common sense and strong values that unite our very diverse citizenry. From their government, it became clear to me over and over again, most of the American people want only a little help every now and then, as they work so hard to make their lives better. And that is exactly what we together should do for them.\nMr. President, the most powerful emotion that I feel, on this morning after, is gratitude: grateful to be an American, proud to be an American; grateful to my wife, Hadassah, my love and my partner, for the devoted support she gave me, and the extraordinary way she reached out to everyone she met in this campaign; grateful to our dear children and mothers and sisters and brothers and relatives and friends, whose help and loved sustained us; grateful to Tipper and the Gore children for being such genuine and generous friends, and for the skill and grace with which they conducted themselves in this campaign; grateful to the Gore-Lieberman campaign staff, whose idealism, ability and hard work make me optimistic about America's future; grateful to my Senate staff here in Washington and back home in Hartford, who have served with me on behalf of the people of Connecticut for so many years, and continue to do so with such commitment during this eventful and unusual year; grateful to the people of Connecticut, whose support over the past 30 years has put me in a position where Al Gore could give me the extraordinary opportunity he did this year.\nI'm grateful to the people of Connecticut, without whose backing this year I would not now have the privilege of looking forward to six more years of service to them and with you, my colleagues, as United States senator.\nMy greatest gratitude is to Vice President Gore himself. He has been my friend and colleague for 15 years now, but I have never been prouder of him than I was this year, and then I was last night. He conducted the campaign with dignity. He presented his policies and programs with conviction. He spoke with a precision that showed respect for the American people. He stuck to the record, and he worked hard, very hard. Al Gore ran this campaign as he lives his life, with honor, intelligence and devotion.\nToday, the vice president can look back on 24 years of public service with great pride in his accomplishments, and he can look forward to the years ahead with great excitement about the unlimited opportunities that await him. I wish him Godspeed, and I look forward to his continued friendship.\nMr. President, the vice president knows, as I do, on this morning that Psalm 30 assures us that weeping may linger for the night, but in the morning, there are shouts of joy.\nSo today, as some of us weep for what could have been, we look to the future with faith that on another morning joy will surely come.\nI thank my colleagues in the Senate from both parties for their warm, personal wishes and support during the last five months. I look forward now to returning to this chamber in January, and working with all of you to help improve the lives of the American people, and to help elevate their respect for the institutions of our great democracy.\nMr. President, I again thank my friend and colleague from New Mexico for yielding me the time. I thank the chair and I yield the floor.", "timestamp": "2000-12-14", "title": "Remarks by Joseph Lieberman on the Floor of the Senate"}

Good evening, my fellow Americans. I appreciate so very much the opportunity to speak with you tonight.\nMr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, friends, distinguished guests, our country has been through a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential election not finalized for longer than any of us could ever imagine.\nVice President Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns. We both gave it our all. We shared similar emotions, so I understand how difficult this moment must be for Vice President Gore and his family.\nHe has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a senator and a vice president.\nThis evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to meet early next week in Washington and we agreed to do our best to heal our country after this hard-fought contest.\nTonight I want to thank all the thousands of volunteers and campaign workers who worked so hard on my behalf.\nI also salute the vice president and his supports for waging a spirited campaign. And I thank him for a call that I know was difficult to make. Laura and I wish the vice president and Senator Lieberman and their families the very best.\nI have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I'm thankful for America and thankful that we were able to resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way.\nI'm thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to serve as your next president.\nI want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active involvement as first lady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a wonderful first lady of America.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him as our next vice president.\n(APPLAUSE)\nTonight I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives because it has been a home to bipartisan cooperation. Here in a place where Democrats have the majority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the people we represent.\nWe've had spirited disagreements. And in the end, we found constructive consensus. It is an experience I will always carry with me, an example I will always follow.\nI want to thank my friend, House Speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced me today. I want to thank the legislators from both political parties with whom I've worked.\nAcross the hall in our Texas capitol is the state Senate. And I cannot help but think of our mutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. His love for Texas and his ability to work in a bipartisan way continue to be a model for all of us.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe spirit of cooperation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in Washington, D.C. It is the challenge of our moment. After a difficult election, we must put politics behind us and work together to make the promise of America available for every one of our citizens.\nI am optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington, D.C.\nI believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past.\nOur nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values far more important than any political disagreements.\nRepublicans want the best for our nation, and so do Democrats. Our votes may differ, but not our hopes.\nI know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. And we must seize this moment and deliver.\nTogether, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, we can unite and inspire the American citizens.\nTogether, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every student of every background and every accent, so that no child is left behind.\nTogether we will save Social Security and renew its promise of a secure retirement for generations to come.\nTogether we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all of our seniors.\nTogether we will give Americans the broad, fair and fiscally responsible tax relief they deserve.\nTogether we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to our friends, and we will have a military equal to every challenge and superior to every adversary.\nTogether we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time, by encouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the American people.\nThis is the essence of compassionate conservatism and it will be a foundation of my administration.\nThese priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns; they are American responsibilities.\nDuring the fall campaign, we differed about the details of these proposals, but there was remarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent schools, retirement and health security, tax relief, a strong military, a more civil society.\nWe have discussed our differences. Now it is time to find common ground and build consensus to make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century.\nI'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it and our history proves it. Two hundred years ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close presidential election. A tie in the Electoral College put the outcome into the hands of Congress.\nAfter six days of voting and 36 ballots, the House of Representatives elected Thomas Jefferson the third president of the United States. That election brought the first transfer of power from one party to another in our new democracy.\nShortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled \"Reconciliation and Reform,\" wrote this. \"The steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor; unequivocal in principle, reasonable in manner. We should be able to hope to do a great deal of good to the cause of freedom and harmony.\"\nTwo hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so as we begin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character: respect for each other, respect for our differences, generosity of spirit, and a willingness to work hard and work together to solve any problem.\nI have something else to ask you, to ask every American. I ask for you to pray for this great nation. I ask for your prayers for leaders from both parties. I thank you for your prayers for me and my family, and I ask you pray for Vice President Gore and his family.\nI have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together as one nation, indivisible. And together we will create and America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream; an America that is educated, so every child has the keys to realize that dream; and an America that is united in our diversity and our shared American values that are larger than race or party.\nI was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation. The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race and every background.\nWhether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests and I will work to earn your respect.\nI will be guided by President Jefferson's sense of purpose, to stand for principle, to be reasonable in manner, and above all, to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony.\nThe presidency is more than an honor. It is more than an office. It is a charge to keep, and I will give it my all.\nThank you very much and God bless America.\n(APPLAUSE)", "timestamp": "2000-12-13", "title": "Address in Austin Accepting Election as the 43rd President of the United States"}

Every Saturday for the past 8 years, I've had the privilege of speaking with you by way of this radio address. Most often, I've talked about meeting our common challenges with commonsense solutions, practical, progressive steps to build an America with opportunity for every responsible citizen, a community of all Americans, and a more peaceful, prosperous world.\nWe've had more than 400 of these Saturday conversations now, so it's fitting that this last one comes on my final day in office. This is, of course, Inaugural Day, an extraordinary day for freedom when the magic, the mystery, the miracle of American democracy is on full display.\nThe peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next, from one party to another, may confound others around the globe. But it reflects the underlying strength of our Constitution and rule of law.\nAs my time in office comes to an end, the most important thing I can say is a simple, heartfelt thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your President and as Commander in Chief to our fine men and women in uniform. Thank you for the honor of working with you to build our bridge to the 21st century. Thank you for the prayers, love, and support you've extended to Hillary, Chelsea, and me every single day.\nI also want to thank all the men and women at the White House who have worked so hard to help me do my job, from the Secret Service to the Residence staff, to those who keep the people's house open for all to enjoy. And I am forever grateful to Vice President Gore for his extraordinary leadership and service, to my Cabinet, and to all others who have served with me.\nFor 8 years, we've done everything in our power to reach beyond party and beyond Washington to put the American people first, overcoming obstacles, seizing opportunities. That's what these radio addresses have been all about. These Saturday talks have often marked action taken to make our schools stronger, our environment cleaner, our food safer, our health care more secure. Some have been big steps and some smaller. But every step has moved us forward, and taken all together, they have made an enormous difference in the lives of our people. And we're not done yet.\nI pledged that I would work until the last hour of the last day. Well, here we are. So, this morning we're building on our commitment to make our streets safer by awarding more than $100 million to fund 1,400 more police officers in communities throughout our land. Back in 1992 I promised that we would fund 100,000 police officers across America. With this announcement, we will have funded 110,000. That's 110 percent of our goal. And I thank our police officers for giving 110 percent to the job. That's a big reason crime is down to a 25-year low.\nNow my job as your President draws to a close, and the work of our new President begins. I want to wish President-elect Bush, Vice President-elect Cheney, their families and entire administration the very best. I know you do, too. Thanks to your work, he takes the reins of a nation renewed, ready to move into a new century and a whole new era in human affairs. I join every American in wishing him Godspeed.\nIn my first radio address, almost exactly 8 years ago now, I spoke about the challenges we faced at that time but also about my abiding faith in the American people. Back then I said, \"We're going up or down together, and I'm convinced we're going up.\" The progress of the last 8 years, the strong values, can-do spirit, and basic goodness of the American people leave me more convinced than ever we're still going up.\nIf we keep working together to widen the circle of opportunity, deepen the reach of freedom, strengthen the bonds of community, America will always be going up.\nThank you for listening each and every week. Thank you again for the honor of serving as your President these past 8 years.\nGod bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2001-01-20", "title": "The President's Radio Address"}

Today, I fulfill that promise.\nPresident Clinton has acknowledged responsibility for his actions. He has admitted that he knowingly gave evasive and misleading answers to questions in the Jones deposition and that his conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice.\nHe has acknowledged that some of his answers were false. He has agreed to a five-year suspension of his Arkansas bar license. And he has agreed not to seek attorney's fees in connection with this matter.\nThe nation's interests have been served, and therefore I decline prosecution. In doing so, I have tried to heed Justice Robert Jackson's wisdom: \"The citizens' safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with humility.\"\nI trust that the decision made today meets the expectations of the American people, who deserve a resolution that acknowledges the president's conduct, respects America's institutions and demonstrates sensitivity to our constitutional system of government.\nThis matter is now concluded.

The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these remarks.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84772", "text": "Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President and Lynne, thank you for being here with us. Laura and I welcome you to the South Lawn, better known as Barney's playground. [Laughter]\nI want to thank members of my Cabinet who've joined us. We've just finished a Cabinet meeting, and I gave themâ€”it gave me a chance to tell them how much I appreciate the good work they're doing during this critical time for our Nation.\nI also appreciate the men and women who make up the Executive Office of the President for joining us today. Some of you have been at the White House for just a few months, others arrived the same day that we did nearly 8 years ago. You're the ones who can tell that my hair has gotten a little grayer. [Laughter] Others here are career employees who have been here for 30 or 40 or sometimes 50 years. I can tell that your hair has gotten grayer. [Laughter]\nPeople on this lawn represent diverse backgrounds, talents, and experiences. Yet we all share a steadfast devotion to the United States. We believe that service to our fellow citizens is a noble calling and the privilege of a lifetime.\nThis is an exciting time for our country. Earlier this week, more than 120 million people voted for a new President and Congress, one of the largest turnouts in the history of the country. No matter how we cast our ballots, this election gives us all reason to be proud of our democracy and our country. And I hope you will join Laura and me in congratulating President-elect Obama and wishing him the very best for his family and our country.\nJust before our Inauguration in 2001, Laura and I went back to Midland, Texas. She was born there, and I was raised there. I said that Laura and I would never quite settle in Washington. I told them, \"While the honor is great, the work is temporary.\" This is true for many of us here today. This peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of a true democracy, and ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the rest of my Presidency. We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new President settle in. This will also be America's first wartime Presidential transition in four decades. We're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us, and they would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people.\nSo over the next 75 days, all of us must ensure that the next President and his team can hit the ground running. For more than a year now, departments and agencies throughout the Federal Government have been preparing for a smooth transition. We've provided intelligence briefings to the President-elect, and the Department of Justice has approved security clearances for members of his transition team. In the coming weeks, we will ask administration officials to brief the Obama team on ongoing policy issues, ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq. I look forward to discussing those issues with the President-elect early next week.\nOffices within the White House are at work preparing extensive transition materials. We're preparing career employees throughout the administration to take on added responsibilities to help prevent any disruption to the essential functions of the Federal Government.\nTaken together, these measures represent an unprecedented effort to ensure that the executive branch is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities at all times. As we carry out this transition, I know that you will continue to conduct yourselves with the decency and professionalism you have shown throughout my time in office.\nSuccessful transition is just one of the many important tasks remaining in our last 75 days. To help address the global financial crisis, the Secretary of Treasury is working endless hours, and I will host an international summit here in Washington on November the 15th. This will be an historic meeting, and I'm confident that you will work hard to help make it a success.\nWe'll also keep urging Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland by defeating the terrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home.\nAs January 20th draws near, some of you may be anxious about finding a new job or a new place to live. I know how you feel. [Laughter] But between now and then, we must keep our attention on the task at hand, because the American people expect no less. Earlier this year, I promised that I would sprint to the finish. I am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some of you a good workout along the way. As we head into the final stretch, I ask you to remain focused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you at the finish line.

What's your best adviceâ€”â€”\nPresident Clinton. Get a good team and do what he thinks is right.\nNational Economy\nQ. Mr. President-elect, you've spoken about the economy, about problems with the economy. Are you going to inherit a recession from President Clinton? And President Clinton, what are your thoughts about that?\nPresident-elect Bush. I really don't have any comments. I look forward to talking to the President. I'm so honored that he extended his hospitality to me and my wife yesterday. He didn't need to do this, and I'm most grateful that he would do so.\nQ. [Inaudible]â€”what do you think about a recession?\nPresident Clinton. Well, a recession is two quarters in a row of negative growth. I don't think we're going to have that. But we couldn't keep up 5 percent growth a year forever. I think 49 of the 50 blue chip forecasters think that growth will be 2.5 percent or better next year, and that will keep unemployment low. But I think there will be things to be managed. He'll have economic challenges, and you ought to give him a chance to meet them, if not try to figure it all out in advance.\nAdvice for the President-Elect\nQ. Are you going toâ€”â€”\nQ. What advice do you have for him, Mr. President?\nQ. [Inaudible].\nPresident Clinton. My only advice to anybody in this is just to get a good team and do what you think is right.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Are you going to North Korea?\nPresident Clinton. No decision has been made on that. We've been talking, our people have, about what we've attempted to do in North Korea. It's interesting, when I had this meeting 8 years ago with the President-elect's father, he told me that the biggest problem that we were facing was the nuclear program in North Korea. And we were able to build on the work they had done and put an end to that.\nAnd now the big problem there is the missile program. We may have a chance to put an end to it, and if we can, I think we should. But this is something that I want to consult with the President-elect and his team about, and we'll see what the facts are, and I'll try to do what's best for the country.\nQ. Governor, I understand that you're not against him going. Is that right?\nPresident-elect Bush. I haven't had a chance to talk to the President yet, Helen [Helen Thomas, Hearst Newspapers].\nPresident Clinton. We've got to talk about this.\nDiscussion With the President-Elect\nQ. What will you tell him is the biggest problem, Mr. President?\nPresident Clinton. I want to talk to him, not you. [Laughter] He can talk about that. I waited 8 years to say that. [Laughter]\nThe White House\nQ. Governor, how different is it to come to this house in your position now than what it was as a family member?\nPresident-elect Bush. It's vastly different. It's such a huge honor to come as the Presidentelect. I don't think I'll really fully realize the impact until I swear-in. I suspect the President would say the same thing. I am humbled and honored, and I can't thank the President enough for his hospitality. He didn't need to do this.\nQ. Yes, he did. [Laughter] It's protocol.\nPresident-elect Bush. I hadn't quite finished yet. [Laughter]\nQ. Go ahead and finish.\nPresident-elect Bush. And I'm grateful. And I look forward to the discussion. I'm here to listen. And if the President is kind enough to offer some advice, if he is, I will take it in.\nQ. Are there questions you have for the President, sir?\nPresident-elect Bush.

Good morning. Last night President-elect Bush and Vice President Gore showed what is best about America. In this election, the American people were closely divided. The outcome was decided by a Supreme Court that was closely divided. But the essential unity of our Nation was reflected in the words and values of those who fought this great contest. I was proud of both men.\nI pledged to President-elect Bush my efforts and the best efforts of every member of our administration for a smooth and successful transition.\nI want to say I am profoundly grateful to Vice President Gore for 8 extraordinary years of partnership. Without his leadership, we could not have made the progress or reached the prosperity we now enjoy and pass on to the next administration.\nI am also profoundly grateful to him for putting into words last night the feelings of all of us who disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision, but accepted it. And as he said, all of us have a responsibility to support Presidentelect Bush and to unite our country in the search for common ground.\nI wish President-elect Bush well. Like him, I came to Washington as a Governor, eager to work with both Republicans and Democrats. And when we reached across party lines to forge a vital center, America was stronger at home and abroad.\nThe American people, however divided they were in this election, overwhelmingly want us to build on that vital center without rancor or personal attack.\nI thank the Members of Congress from both parties who have pledged to work with the President-elect. They have also pledged to elect commonsense bipartisan election reforms so that the votes of all citizens can be easily cast and easily counted in future elections.\nFinally, I want to thank the American people for their patience, passion, and patriotism throughout this extended election season. In the days of service left to me, I will do all I can to finish our remaining work with Congress and to help President-elect Bush get off to a good start.\nAs I've said so many times over the last year, our country has never before enjoyed so much peace and prosperity with so few internal crises and so little external threat. We have the opportunity to build the future of our dreams for our children, and every one of us has an obligation to work together to achieve it.\nThank you very much.\nQ. Mr. President, what do you say to Democrats who want to run on the election issue in 2 years? Do you think that's a way to take back the House?\nThe President. Well, I think, first of all, the election 2 years from now is difficult to predict, and it will take whatever shape it does. But for right now, we're in a period where we've had an election, but we haven't had the Inauguration. We have to ensure a smooth and constructive transition, and all of us should ensure that we do our part to give the President-elect his chance to do this job. And I would hopeâ€” and I believe that my fellow Democrats would be willing to do that, and I hope they will. I hope they will set a good example by getting off to a good start and trying to unite the country.\nTwo years from now, what I hope will happen is that the honest differences that remain between the two parties will be the subject of a wholesome, vigorous, constructive debate, but that we will be moving further and further away from rancor. That, I think, is actually good for our party, because I think people do agree with us on the issuesâ€”on so many of the vital issues of the day.\nBut I don't think that now is the time to do anything other than follow Vice President Gore's lead. He spoke for all of us last night, and he did it eloquently and well. And President-elect Bush responded with generosity in kind, I thought, in his remarks. And I think we ought to use this opportunity to let the country come together and try to get the new administration off to a good start.\nThank you.\nQ. Mr. President, will your successor continue the special relationship you've enjoyed with Britain, do you hope?\nThe President. I can't imagine anybody who wouldn't do that. I think he will, yes.

{"author": "Albert Gore, Jr.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29754", "text": "Good evening.\nJust moments ago, I spoke with George W. Bush and congratulated him on becoming the 43rd president of the United States. And I promised him that I wouldn't call him back this time. I offered to meet with him as soon as possible so that we can start to heal the divisions of the campaign and the contest through which we've just passed.\nAlmost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, \"Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.\" Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.\nOver the library of one of our great law schools is inscribed the motto, \"Not under man but under God and law.\" That's the ruling principle of American freedom, the source of our democratic liberties. I've tried to make it my guide throughout this contest, as it has guided America's deliberations of all the complex issues of the past five weeks.\nNow the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken. Let there be no doubt, while Istrongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it. I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession. I also accept my responsibility, which I will discharge unconditionally, to honor the new President-elect and do everything possible to help him bring Americans together in fulfillment of the great vision that our Declaration of Independence defines and that our Constitution affirms and defends.\nLet me say how grateful I am to all those who supported me and supported the cause for which we have fought. Tipper and I feel a deep gratitude to Joe and Hadassah Lieberman, who brought passion and high purpose to our partnership and opened new doors, not just for our campaign but for our country.\nThis has been an extraordinary election. But in one of God's unforeseen paths, this belatedly broken impasse can point us all to a new common ground, for its very closeness can serve to remind us that we are one people with a shared history and a shared destiny. Indeed, that history gives us many examples of contests as hotly debated, as fiercely fought, with their own challenges to the popular will. Other disputes have dragged on for weeks before reaching resolution. And each time, both the victor and the vanquished have accepted the result peacefully and in a spirit of reconciliation.\nSo let it be with us.\nI know that many of my supporters are disappointed. I am too. But our disappointment must be overcome by our love of country.\nAnd I say to our fellow members of the world community, let no one see this contest as a sign of American weakness. The strength of American democracy is shown most clearly through the difficulties it can overcome. Some have expressed concern that the unusual nature of this election might hamper the next president in the conduct of his office. I do not believe it need be so.\nPresident-elect Bush inherits a nation whose citizens will be ready to assist him in the conduct of his large responsibilities. I, personally, will be at his disposal, and I call on all Americans -- I particularly urge all who stood with us -- to unite behind our next president. This is America. Just as we fight hard when the stakes are high, we close ranks and come together when the contest is done. And while there will be time enough to debate our continuing differences, now is the time to recognize that that which unites us is greater than that which divides us. While we yet hold and do not yield our opposing beliefs, there is a higher duty than the one we owe to political party. This is America and we put country before party; we will stand together behind our new president.\nAs for what I'll do next, I don't know the answer to that one yet. Like many of you, I'm looking forward to spending the holidays with family and old friends. I know I'll spend time in Tennessee and mend some fences, literally and figuratively.\nSome have asked whether I have any regrets, and I do have one regret: that I didn't get the chance to stay and fight for the American people over the next four years, especially for those who need burdens lifted and barriers removed, especially for those who feel their voices have not been heard. I heard you. And I will not forget.\nI've seen America in this campaign, and I like what I see. It's worth fighting for and that's a fight I'll never stop. As for the battle that ends tonight, I do believe, as my father once said, that \"No matter how hard the loss, defeat might serve as well as victory to shape the soul and let the glory out.\"\nSo for me this campaign ends as it began: with the love of Tipper and our family; with faith in God and in the country I have been so proud to serve, from Vietnam to the vice presidency; and with gratitude to our truly tireless campaign staff and volunteers, including all those who worked so hard in Florida for the last 36 days.\nNow the political struggle is over and we turn again to the unending struggle for the common good of all Americans and for those multitudes around the world who look to us for leadership in the cause of freedom.\nIn the words of our great hymn, \"America, America\": \"Let us crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.\"\nAnd now, my friends, in a phrase I once addressed to others: it's time for me to go.\nThank you, and good night, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2000-12-13", "title": "Address Conceding the 2000 Presidential Election"}
